    respondents, Gerling Canada Insurance Company (“GCAN”) and Economical Mutual
    Insurance Company (“Economical”) seek an order requiring the appellant, Unique
    Labeling Inc. (“Unique”) to post the total amount of $490,627.16 as security
    for costs prior to continuing with its appeal, pursuant to Rule 61.06.  This
    sum includes $88,944.45 in appeal costs, outstanding costs awards from the
    trial of $395,532.19 and $6,150.52 of interest on those trial costs.  The
    respondents argue that there is good reason to believe that Unique has insufficient
    assets in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal, and thus an order for security for
    costs is appropriate.  For the reasons given below, I grant the respondents’ motion,
    and order Unique to post security for costs in the amount of $120,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unique
    is an American company that supplied bottled spring, carbonated and flavoured
    water products to the Kroger Company (“Kroger”), a grocery retailer in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oregon.  The plastic bottles used by Unique were supplied by Triumbari Containers
    Ltd. (“TCL”), a Canadian company operated by Dominic Triumbari (“Triumbari”).  The
    assembly of Unique’s products took place in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, at the Cynar Dry Company (“Cynar”) bottling facility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 2001, Kroger terminated its business relationship with Unique due to
    contaminants found in the bottled water, such as sand and bacteria.  Unique
    sued TCL, Triumbari and Cynar in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oregon, claiming they were responsible for the contaminations, and thus liable
    for the losses Unique suffered as a result.  The suit was successful, and
    an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oregon jury found TCL, Triumbari and Cynar liable in the amount of $1,449,792
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    for negligence, breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties.  That
    judgment remains largely unsatisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GCAN
    and Economical insure TCL and its officers, which includes Triumbari.  Cynar
    is insured by the ING Insurance Company of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“ING”).  When the appellant was unsuccessful in collecting on its judgment,
    it brought an action against GCAN, Economical and ING in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, seeking to recover from them the amounts owed to it by TCL, Triumbari
    and Cynar, pursuant to s. 132(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. I.8 (the “<i>Act</i>”).  That section reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Where a person incurs a
    liability for injury or damage to the person or property of another, and
    is insured against such liability, and fails to satisfy a judgment awarding
    damages against the person in respect of the person’s liability, and an execution
    against the person in respect thereof remains unsatisfied, the person entitled
    to the damages may recover by action against the insurer in the amount of
    the  judgment up to the face value of the policy, but subject to the same
    equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    action was dismissed.  The trial judge found that Unique could not make use
    of s. 132(1) of the <i>Act</i>, as that section only applies where the damages
    were awarded “for injury or damage to the person or property of another”.  The
    trial judge found that the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oregon award was solely for economic loss, rather than damage to property.  He
    further found that, as any alleged contamination occurred while the bottled
    water products were in the possession of TCL or Cynar, the contamination
    did not occur to the “property of another”.  Unique settled with ING after
    the trial, but is appealing the trial judge’s decision in respect of GCAN
    and Economic.  Finally, the trial judge also held that the Economical and
    ING policies did not cover losses of the sort at issue in the trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents argue that there are two bases on which Unique should be ordered
    to post security for costs.  First, pursuant to rule 56.01(1)(a), they submit
    that Unique is ordinarily resident within
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oregon, rather than
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Second, pursuant to rule 56.01(1)(d), the respondents argue that
    there is good reason to believe that Unique has insufficient assets in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay the respondents’ costs in the appeal.  The respondents allege
    that Unique last actively conducted business in 2004, and has no assets other
    than this lawsuit.  Rule 61.06(1)(b), which deals with security for costs
    of an appeal, provides that any basis for ordering security for costs under
    Rule 56.01 also serves as a basis for ordering security for costs under Rule
    61.06.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of their motion, the respondents note that Unique was ordered to
    post security for costs to ING prior to the underlying trial in the amount
    of $75,000.  This sum was provided by Mr. Suh, a friend of the principals
    of Unique, and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Dawson
    &amp;
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Dawson,  Unique’s
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    counsel.  Unique has a contingency fee agreement with Dawson &amp; Dawson,
    and the respondents submit that Dawson
    &amp; Dawson thus has an interest in the litigation.  After ING successfully
    received a security for costs award before trial, the respondents brought
    a motion to receive the same.  This motion was denied.  The respondents submit
    that this was because they neglected to cross-examine Unique, with the result
    that the Master accepted Unique’s claim that the subsequent security for
    costs orders would prevent it from carrying on with the litigation.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    anticipation of Unique’s claim that it is impecunious, and that an order
    to post security for costs would prevent it from proceeding with the appeal,
    the respondents submit that there is no credible evidence that Unique’s principals,
    Lance and Jeffrey McClelland, either do not have access to funds or that
    an injustice would result if Unique were not allowed to proceed with the
    action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    dealing with these issues, I must deal with Unique’s primary submission that
    the issue of security for costs is <i>res judicata</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ISSUES</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I. Is the issue of security for costs <i>res judicata</i>?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unique
    submits that the issue of security for costs is <i>res judicata </i>because
    Economical and GCAN’s motion for security for costs prior to trial was dismissed.  In
    dismissing that motion, the Master held that Unique was impecunious but that
    its action was not without merit.  That decision was not appealed.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that <i>res judicata </i>can apply to an interlocutory order.  Unique
    submits that the issue of security for costs has been decided between the
    same parties on an interlocutory motion, and is <i>res judicata </i>because
    an appeal is not a new proceeding. <i> </i>  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the authorities submitted by Unique in support of its position were directly
    on point, nor were they of much assistance by analogy.  This may be because
    the circumstances respecting a motion for security for costs before and after
    a trial are not the same.  A motion for security for costs prior to trial
    is normally heard after pleadings have been closed, and often before any
    form of discovery has taken place.  It comes at a very preliminary stage
    where the likelihood of the outcome is much more difficult to assess.  Thus,
    prior to trial, the merits of the action have a role to play, but the analysis
    is based primarily on the pleadings, evidence filed on the motion and, where
    available, to selected portions of the examination for discovery: <i>Coastline
    Corp. v. Canaccord Capital Corp</i>.,<i> </i>[2009] O.J. No. 1790 (S.C.),
    at paras. 7(v), (vi), and (vii).  In this case, Unique also had the advantage
    of a foreign judgment based on a jury verdict in its favour.    <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    situation is different once the trial has concluded.  At this point, a judge
    who has had the benefit of hearing all of the evidence has made a decision
    and given extensive reasons for his findings.  Those findings are entitled
    to deference by an appellate court in the absence of any palpable and overriding
    error.  Based on the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence in this case,
    GCAN and Economical have an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario judgment in their favour.  GCAN and Economical were respectively
    awarded $185,532.19 and $210,000 in trial costs inclusive of GST.  Thus,
    in order for Unique to have its day in court, GCAN and Economical have already
    put out considerable time and money.  It does not necessarily follow that
    they ought to be called on to invest more time and money without the possibility
    of recovering any of their costs in the event that Unique’s appeal is unsuccessful.  Unique’s
    submission that the motion for security for costs pending the hearing of
    its appeal is <i>res judicata </i>is dismissed. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. The supplementary affidavit </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    GCAN and Economical delivered their motion record and Unique had delivered
    its motion record in response, GCAN and Economical conducted cross-examinations
    in writing and received the answers on July 13, 2009.  GCAN and Economical’s
    facta and books of authorities needed to be served and filed with this court
    on July 13, 2009.  On the morning of July 16, 2009, Unique sent a supplementary
    affidavit of Lance McClelland by fax to counsel for GCAN and Economical.  No
    explanation for the late delivery of the affidavit was proffered.  GCAN and
    Economical opposed its admission on the basis that Unique was trying to repair
    the inadequacies in its case pointed out in the facta of GCAN and Economical.  The
    supplementary affidavit elaborates on statements made in earlier affidavits
    respecting the financial situation of Lance McClelland and his brother Jeffrey,
    and is relevant evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    exercised my discretion and admitted the supplementary affidavit, at the
    same time offering an adjournment to counsel for GCAN and Economical if they
    wished to cross-examine on it.  They declined. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. Is Unique without access to funds to prosecute
      its appeal?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no issue that Unique is a foreign corporation with insufficient assets
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay a costs award.  Inasmuch as Unique asserts that it will be
    without funds to prosecute its appeal if it is required to post security
    for costs, it bears the burden of establishing this impecuniosity.
     Unique is required to show that its principal shareholders, Lance and Jeffrey
    McLelland, who stand to benefit from any award in Unique’s favour, cannot
    post security for costs and have no internal or external access to funds.  Complete
    financial disclosure is required with supporting documentation.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lance
    McLelland’s supplementary affidavit, filed on behalf of himself and his brother,
    deposes that they each have about a 10% interest in Giumarra and Associates
    Beverage Company (“Giumarra”) through their respective partial ownership
    interests in Synergy Group LLC (“Synergy”), one of the partners in Giumarra.  Giumarra
    posted a loss last year.  Other than the bald statement that Synergy has
    no other business than as a partner in Giumarra, no information as to Synergy’s
    financial condition is disclosed.  The extent of the McLellands’ interest
    in Synergy is not disclosed.  The balance sheet of Giumarra shows that Synergy
    contributed $1,123,795 in capital to Giumarra in 2008, several months after
    the motion for security for costs brought before trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the lack of information provided to this court regarding the McLellands’ interest
    in Synergy or Synergy’s financial condition, I find that Unique has not discharged
    its burden of establishing that it does not have access to the means to post
    security for costs.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of my conclusion, it is not necessary for me to deal with the argument
    of GCAN and Economical that Dawson &amp; Dawson should be required to post
    security for costs.  In any event, I note that the answer given in cross-examination
    as to whether the McLellands could access funds from Dawson &amp; Dawson
    to post security for costs was that the firm had declined to provide these
    funds.     </p>

    the corporate plaintiff fails to discharge its evidentiary burden of showing
    it has no access to funds to post security for costs, Ontario courts do not
    appear to inquire into the merits of the appeal or consider other factors:  see <i>Smith

    not followed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in <i>ABI Biotechnology Inc.
    v. Apotex Inc. </i>(1995), 41 C.P.C. (3d) 394, at para. 19, where other relevant
    factors were considered, such as the merits of the case, the purposes of
    the application for security for costs, the size and nature of the corporation,
    and the hardships to the plaintiffs if security was ordered.  However, in <i>ABI
    Biotechnology Inc. v. Apotex Inc.</i>, [2000] 3 W.W.R. 217 (
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Man.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (“<i>Apotex No. 2</i>”), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A.
    No. 113, the Manitoba Court of Appeal broke with its earlier decision, and
    adopted the same approach to this issue as the Ontario courts have taken. <i> </i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Apotex
      No. 2</i>, the record indicated that at least some of the shareholders
      of the responding party had sufficient assets to allow the responding party
      to abide by an order for security for costs if one were made.  In <i>Smith</i>,
      the court noted that there was no evidence of impecuniosity, either on
      the part of the responding company or its shareholders.  This case is different,
      as Unique’s principal shareholders have sworn that they lack the assets
      to post security for costs, but have failed to provide sufficient information
      to discharge their evidentiary onus on this point.  The possibility exists
      that Unique’s principal shareholders are in fact unable to post security
      for costs.           </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Security
    for costs orders are to be made “as is just”.  Even where the responding
    party is found to be impecunious, justice may require that party to post
    some security for costs.  Given the aforementioned evidentiary problem in
    this case, and out of an abundance of caution, I propose to make some brief
    comment on the merits of the appeal as well as the other factors, although
    it is not strictly necessary for me to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground of appeal in the Notice of Appeal is that “the trial judge erred
    in failing to consider the proper legal test required with respect to s.
    132 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>”.  My understanding of this ground is that
    it raises a question of mixed fact and law.  Other grounds of appeal in paras.
    2-13 allege evidentiary and factual errors on the part of the trial judge.  As
    a result of these alleged errors, para. 14 challenges four factual findings
    on the part of the trial judge and one legal error of interpretation respecting
    the exclusion clause in the insurance contract of TCL.  Thus, Unique will
    have a high hurdle in respect of a number of the grounds of appeal it has
    alleged.  Given the grounds of appeal, if Unique is successful on appeal,
    a new trial may be required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury awarded $149,792
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    for past losses.  The bulk of the award, $1,300,000, was for loss of future
    profits.  On the basis of expert opinion regarding
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oregon law, the trial judge held, at paras. 190-191 of his reasons, that
    these amounts were for pure economic loss and liability did not arise from
    property damage.  At trial, the parties agreed that s. 132(1) of the <i>Act</i> does
    not extend to pure economic loss.  The trial judge also decided the coverage
    issue against Unique.  The appeal appears to be weak.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unique
    is now inactive, and is not in bankruptcy proceedings.  The sizes of Giumarra
    and Synergy are unknown.  For the reasons I have indicated, I am not satisfied
    that Unique has discharged its burden of showing it has no access to funds.
    I also note that Unique was able to post $75,000 in security for costs prior
    to trial after ING’s successful motion.  The evidence does not demonstrate
    to me that Unique would suffer hardship if required to post security for
    costs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orders
    for security for costs on an appeal are only to be made “as is just.”  However,
    having regard to all of the factors indicated, I am of the opinion that no
    injustice will result from requiring Unique to post security for costs.  Accordingly,
    the respondents are entitled to such an order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>V. The amount to be posted for security for costs</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    61.06 enables me to “make such order for security for costs of the proceeding
    and of the appeal as is just.”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unique
    submits that, as any cost order is stayed pending appeal, it ought not to
    have to post any security for the costs of the trial.  That submission ignores
    the plain wording of Rule 61.06.  Often, however, the court will exercise
    its discretion and only order that costs respecting the appeal or part of
    the costs of the trial be posted as security. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the estimated costs of the appeal, and to the factors discussed
    above, I order that Unique post security for costs in the amount of $60,000
    in favour of each of GCAN and Economical within 30 days of this date if it
    wishes to pursue its appeal.  Unique shall have 30 days from this date to
    perfect its appeal.  The amounts required as security for costs must therefore
    be posted before Unique’s appeal is perfected.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the parties are unable to agree, they may make submissions in writing respecting
    the costs of this motion.</p>
