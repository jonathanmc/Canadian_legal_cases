  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court of Justice, Family Court,
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa, dated February 11, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asks that a portion of the judgment be set aside in which the trial
    judge ordered him to pay:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         $45,920.28 on account of loans made
    by the respondent to him; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         the sum of $10,500 for unjust enrichment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant must meet a stringent standard of review.  As this court noted
    in <i>Juvatopolos v. Juvatopolos</i>,<i> </i>[2005] O.J. No. 4181:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The decision of the [judge below] is entitled to
    deference on appeal and the standard of review is designed to promote finality
    in family law litigation and to recognize the importance of the appreciation
    of the facts by the trial judge: see <i>Hickey v. Hickey</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R.
    518 at paras. 11-12.  It is only where the trial judge’s decision exceeds
    a generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible and is
    plainly wrong that an appellate court is entitled to interfere: see <i>Silver
    v. Silver</i> (1985), 54 O.R. (2d) 591 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the appellant strives to avoid this exacting standard of review by characterizing
    findings of fact as legal issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he poses the question whether monies advanced and subsequently co-mingled
    in a joint investment account, which were then lost on the stock market,
    can, in law, be found to be a loan repayable to the party who originally
    advanced the funds.  It may well be that, as a general proposition, parties
    must share the investment losses of monies held jointly.   Here, however,
    the trial judge found as facts that respondent loaned the appellant $44,500,
    that he used this money to day trade, that he was not trading on the respondent’s
    behalf and that she never give him money to trade on her behalf.  These findings
    were amply supported by the evidence, notably the trial judge’s finding of
    credibility against the appellant and the testimony of a witness that the
    appellant told him that he was borrowing money from the respondent to trade
    in stocks.  The trial judge’s conclusion that the monies the respondent gave
    the appellant were a loan, even though the appellant placed them in a joint
    account at one point, was based on these findings.  We see no reason to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant also submits that unjust enrichment cannot be established in
    law when both parties in an unmarried relationship have contributed significantly
    to the relationship by money and money’s worth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this broad proposition.  The trial judge considered all of
    the contributions, monetary and non-monetary, made by each of the parties
    to the family enterprise during the period of cohabitation and found that
    the appellant had been unjustly enriched by the amount of $10,500.00.  The
    trial judge found the respondent had made direct contributions to the improvement
    and renovation of the appellant’s house, and some mortgage payments as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the submissions of counsel, the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that
    she took into account all the circumstances including that the respondent
    lived rent free in the appellant’s home during the first 8 months of the
    relationship, that the parties had shared domestic duties and that the appellant
    had performed considerable renovation work on the home the respondent owned.  The
    findings of the trial judge are matters of fact, and are amply supported
    by the evidence.  There is no basis to interfere with her conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that $10,500 is <i>de minimis</i>.  We disagree.  The
    trial judge found that it was a significant amount considering the financial
    status of the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  Costs in favour of the respondent are fixed in the
    amount of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
