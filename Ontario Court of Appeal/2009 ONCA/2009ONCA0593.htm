    issue on this appeal is <span style='line-height:200%'>whether the claims
    advanced by the appellant Matrix Integrated Solutions Limited (“Matrix”)
    are governed by a forum selection clause.  Matrix and the respondent, Radiant
    Hospitality Systems Ltd. (“Radiant”), agreed that Texas would have exclusive
    jurisdiction over all disputes “arising out of, or in connection with” their
    agreement.  Matrix argues that as it asserts claims against Radiant for conspiracy
    and for knowingly assisting Matrix’s former employees in breaching their
    fiduciary duties, the claims are not governed by the contractual forum selection
    clause.  The motions judge held that the forum selection clause governed
    and stayed the action against Radiant unless the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>DECISION OF THE MOTION JUDGE</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that, by alleging a violation of a duty of good faith,
    Matrix was relying on the RA.  He also noted that in affidavits filed on
    the motion, Radiant had identified several provisions in the RA it intended
    to rely on in its defence.  These were provisions making the relationship
    with Matrix non-exclusive, reserving Radiant’s right to appoint other resellers,
    limiting Radiant’s liability for damages under the agreement, and allowing
    Radiant to terminate the RA if Matrix failed to meet its quota.  He concluded
    that “[b]ecause the RA will be relied upon to support the claims and to defend
    against them, it must be concluded that the claims, and the action in which
    Matrix asserts them
    ‘arises out of or is in connection with’ the RA”, the forum selection clause
    applied unless Matrix could show “strong cause” why it should not: <i>Z.I.
    Pompey Industrie v. ECU Line N.V</i>., [2003] 1 S.C.R. 450, at paras 20-21. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that there was a real and substantial connection between
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario and the claim against Radiant.  No appeal is taken against that finding.  Matrix
    argued that if forced to sue in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Texas, it would lose the ability to allege that Radiant had conspired with
    the other defendants, over whom the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Texas courts would have no jurisdiction.  The motion judge agreed that if
    Matrix could not join all parties in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Texas, the denial of that right could constitute strong cause.  However,
    no evidence as to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Texas law was adduced to support the joinder argument.  The motion judge
    ruled that the appropriate order was to stay the action against Radiant,
    unless and until the courts in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Texas decided not to assume jurisdiction over the
    <st1:State w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The motion judge did not have the benefit of this court’s decision in <i>Precious
        Metal Capital Corp. v. Smith</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 701 (“<i>Precious
        Metal</i>”).  <i>Precious Metal</i> dealt with the application of forum
        selection clauses in a series of agreements to claims for breach of fiduciary
        duty similar to those advanced in the present case.  Writing for the
        court, Doherty J.A. held that in order to determine whether the claims
        for breach of fiduciary duty fell within the reach of the forum selection
        clauses, an important first step was to characterize the nature of the
        claims as they were in the statement of claim.  Doherty J.A., at paras
        10-11, agreed with the conclusion of the motion judge that the claims
    “in pith and substance” centred on a fiduciary relationship and the allegation
    that two of the defendants “deliberately orchestrated events” to put the
    plaintiff at a disadvantage and to misappropriate to themselves a commercial
    opportunity.  As the case was “not contractual in substance” but rather about “an
    allegedly abusive course of conduct by fiduciaries”, the forum selection
    clauses in those agreements did not apply (emphasis removed).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Applying
    a similar analysis to this case, the claims for breach of fiduciary duty
    and conspiracy advanced in the amended statement of claim cannot fairly be
    described as “contractual in substance”.  As in <i>Precious Metal</i>, they
    are “in pith and substance” centred on a fiduciary relationship and the allegation
    that Radiant conspired with and knowingly assisted Naccarato and Markou to
    breach their fiduciary obligations.  The RA is merely part of the factual
    background that explains the existence and nature of the relationship that
    existed between Matrix and Radiant prior to the alleged wrongs that form
    the basis of this action.  In my view, the claims for conspiracy and knowing
    assistance do not arise out of or in connection with the provisions of the
    RA.  The elements of the causes of action asserted do not depend upon the
    RA, and the RA can be removed from the picture without undermining those
    claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    respectfully disagree with the motion judge’s conclusion that Matrix relied
    upon the RA in advancing this claim.  The motion judge focused on the ambiguous
    reference to a “breach of a duty of good faith” in paras. 37-38 of the amended
    statement of claim: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>37. Each and all of the
    defendants have violated the duty of good faith owing to Matrix as a result
    of the circumstances set out above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>38. In particular, Naccarato
    and Markou owed a duty of good faith in the performance of all obligations
    arising from their employment with Matrix. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>These paragraphs must be read in the context of the amended statement of
      claim as a whole.  The allegation that Radiant owed Matrix a duty of good
      faith under the RA was deleted when the claim was amended.  It is not at
      all clear to me how, when read in context, para. 37 can be construed as
      referring to any duty arising under the RA.  It refers to the duty of good
      faith owed by <i>all</i> of the defendants and appears to me to be a rather
      inapt and imprecise reference to the equitable and fiduciary duties that
      ground the claim.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>Nor do I agree with the motion judge that Radiant can bring the case within
      the reach of the forum selection clause by asserting that it will rely
      on the RA in defending the claims advanced.  At this stage, Radiant has
      not filed its statement of defence and, as held in <i>Precious Metal</i> at
      para. 10, “[t]he characterization of the claims depends in large measure
      on the contents of the statement of claim.”  The provisions in the RA making
      the relationship with Matrix non-exclusive, reserving Radiant’s right to
      appoint other resellers, limiting Radiant’s liability for damages under
      the agreement and allowing Radiant to terminate the RA should Matrix fail
      to meet its quota form part of the context and explain the nature of the
      relationship between Radiant and Matrix, but they have no direct bearing
      on the claims of conspiracy or knowing assistance of a breach of fiduciary
      relationship.  These claims do not rest on the assertion that Matrix has
      exclusive rights under the RA or that Radiant does not have the right to
      enter contracts with other parties.  The claim is that Radiant knew that
      the former employees were in breach of their fiduciary duties and conspired
      with them and assisted them in that regard.  While the RA may have given
      Radiant the right to contract with the former employees if they had not
      been fiduciaries of Matrix, or if Radiant had not known that the employees
      had breached their fiduciary duties, that has no bearing on the claims
      that Matrix advances.  As Matrix does not claim damages under the RA or

      am not persuaded that the interpretive approach reflected by those authorities
      goes so far as justify the stay granted by the motion judge.  In </span><i><span lang=EN-US

      O.R. (3d) 737 (“<i>Dalimpex</i>”), at paras. 41-43, this court adopted
      and applied the test for applying a contractual provision which employs
      the words “disputes arising out of or in connection with” the parties’
    contract used by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>Kaverit Steel and Crane Ltd.
    v. Kone Corp. </i>(1992), 87 D.L.R. (4th) 129 (“<i>Kaverit Steel</i>”), at
    p. 135, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1992] 2 S.C.R. vii.  According
    to that test, a dispute is caught by the provision “if either claimant or
    defendant relies on the existence of a contractual obligation as a necessary
    element to create the claim, or to defeat it.”  See also <i>Woolcock</i> at
    para. 23, holding that a claim is one “relating to” a contract “[s]o long
    as the matter in dispute is referable to <i>the interpretation or implementation
    of some provision</i> of the Agreement” (emphasis added).  </span></p>

        Steel</i>, the plaintiff advanced a conspiracy claim that relied upon
        a breach of the contract as the source of the unlawfulness to ground
        the conspiracy, and that was held to fall within the scope of the arbitration
        clause.  Likewise, in <i>Dalimpex</i>, the claims for conspiracy and
        breach of fiduciary duty were mingled with claims for breach of contract
        and, in any event, in that case, this court declined to express any definitive
        view on the reach of the arbitration clause holding that determination
        should be left for the arbitrator.</span></p>

      present case is not one where “either claimant or defendant relies on the
      existence of a contractual obligation as a necessary element to create
      the claim, or to defeat it” or where the “matter in dispute is referable
      to the interpretation or implementation of some provision in the agreement.”  The
      RA is simply part of the factual background.
     I see this case as being much closer to <i>Precious Metal</i>, where the
    pleadings was characterized as advancing a non-contractual claim for breach
    of fiduciary duty that did not fall within the reach of the forum selection
    clause.  I do not agree with Radiant that Matrix has simply relabeled what
    remains essentially a claim in contract to avoid the forum selection clause,
    and that to allow the action to proceed in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
