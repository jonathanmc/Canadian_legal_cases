    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was negligent because it failed to prioritize Patrick’s medical needs

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    claim alleges that Patrick Heaslip died on February 4, 2005, at the age of
    17 as a result of injuries sustained in a tobogganing accident.  The claim
    is brought by Patrick’s family members and his estate.  At about 6:00 p.m.
    on February 4, Patrick was tobogganing down a hill at the Mansfield Ski Club
    when his toboggan struck a steel snow gun.  He was thrown from the toboggan
    and collided with a tree.  As a result, he suffered a right pneumothorax,
    a collapsed lung, a laceration through the lower right lobe of his right
    lung, numerous rib fractures compromising his right parietal pleura, pulmonary
    vascular congestion and edema.  He was taken to the home where he was staying,
    and from there he was taken by land ambulance to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Stevenson
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    approximately 8:35 p.m., one of the defendant physicians, having assessed
    Patrick’s injuries and the treatment he required, requested an air ambulance
    to take Patrick from Stevenson Memorial to St. Michael’s Hospital in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  At around 8:49 p.m., the Medical Air Transport Centre (the “MATC”),
    which is operated by
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, advised that an air ambulance would not be available for 2 hours.  The
    doctor thereupon cancelled the request for an air ambulance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    approximately 10:01 p.m., a land ambulance carrying Patrick left Stevenson
    Memorial to take Patrick to St. Michael’s Hospital.  At 10:29 p.m., he was
    noted as having no vital signs.  The ambulance was redirected to Southlake
    Regional Health Centre in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Newmarket.  Patrick was pronounced dead at 10:56 p.m.  </p>

    claim alleges that there was an air ambulance helicopter near Stevenson Memorial
    when the request for an air ambulance was made, and that it was carrying
    a patient with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    claim further alleges that the MATC Manual of Operational Policy and Procedure
    provides for the reassignment of an air ambulance from an existing assignment
    to deal with a higher priority patient, regardless of the stage of the existing
    assignment.  It is further alleged that the MATC knew that Patrick’s life-threatening
    medical condition had a higher priority response than the patient on board
    the air ambulance near Stevenson Memorial, but that the MATC failed to re-assign
    the air ambulance (thus failing to comply with their own manual of Operational
    Policy and Procedure) to take Patrick to St. Michael’s Hospital.  The claim
    also alleges that neither of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s other two on-duty air ambulances were available.  One was grounded
    because the pilot had reached the limit of his duty hours and the other was
    unavailable because it required maintenance. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Ambulance

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge identified the key issue as being whether, on the facts pleaded
    in the claim, it was arguable that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario owed Patrick Heaslip a private law duty of care in relation to the
    request for an air ambulance.  He assessed the claim against the now familiar <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test,
    as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i>,
    [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario conceded that on the facts pleaded, foreseeability was established,
    the motion judge focused on the issue of proximity.  He concluded that the
    claim did not fall within an established category, and that it was thus necessary
    to consider whether a new category of duty of care should be recognized in
    this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    found that the claim should be characterized as a failure to act or nonfeasance
    in circumstances where there was no positive duty to act.  He reviewed the
    provisions of the <i>Act</i> and, relying on <i>Eliopoplos (Litigation Trustee
    of) v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario</i> <i>(Minister of Health and Long-Term Care)</i> <span class=canliicitation><span

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (“<i>Attis</i>”),</span> concluded that the <i>Act</i> gave rise only to
    duties to the public at large.  At para. 54 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that the statutory scheme does not create
    any private law duty of care as between the Crown and Patrick.&nbsp; The
    Minister’s duties are owed to the public at large, not to any individual
    member.&nbsp; Accordingly, there does not exist the necessary proximate relationship.&nbsp; The
    Minister is invested with the duty and power to ensure the existence throughout
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, for the public as a whole, of a balanced and integrated system of
    ambulance services and communication services used in dispatching ambulances.&nbsp; The
    Minister has the discretion to use that power for the benefit of the public
    as a whole in fulfilling the Minister’s mandate.&nbsp; The overall scheme
    of the statute contemplates that the Minister’s duty of care is not owed
    to individual members of the public but rather to the public as a whole in
    respect to the provision of air ambulance services. &nbsp;Those powers are
    not circumscribed by the <i>Act</i> in order to specify exactly how those
    air ambulance services are to be provided.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also considered the second stage of the <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test
    and held that, even if the appellants had made out a prima facie case for
    a duty of care, there were residual policy considerations that justified
    denying liability.  He found that the imposition of a duty of care would
    give rise to the prospect of indeterminate liability.  He also concluded
    that imposing a duty of care would have a chilling effect on

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I agree that certain allegations contained in the claim assert purely public

    my view, it is arguable that those facts, if proven, are capable of supporting
    the existence of a duty of care upon the province.  This is so either on
    the basis that the claim alleges a duty of care that falls within an established
    category, or because the facts alleged bring Patrick Heaslip into a direct
    relationship with Ontario that is sufficiently proximate to satisfy the <i>Cooper-Anns </i>test
    for recognizing a new category of duty of care.  As it is not
    “plain and obvious” that no duty of care arises, the claim against
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario should not be dismissed at the pleading stage: see <i>Hunt v. Carey

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is distinguishable from cases like <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Attis</i>.  In
    those cases, the plaintiffs suffered harm at the hands of a party involved
    in an activity subject to regulatory authority, and then alleged negligence
    on the part of the governmental authority charged with the duty of regulating
    the activity that gave rise to the plaintiff’s loss.  <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Attis</i> hold
    that such plaintiffs have no direct relationship with the governmental authority
    and can assert no higher claim to a duty of care than any other member of
    the public. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    claim asserted here does not rest solely upon a statute conferring regulatory
    powers, as in <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Attis</i>, but is focused instead on the
    specific interaction that took place between Patrick Heaslip and
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario when the request for an air ambulance was made.  In this case, the
    relationship between Patrick Heaslip and the governmental authority is direct,
    rather than being mediated by a party subject to the regulatory control of
    the governmental authority.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants allege acts of negligence in responding to a specific request
    for urgently required medical services and the negligent failure to comply
    with an established government policy, both of which are alleged to have
    caused harm to Patrick Heaslip.  I agree with the appellants that the alleged
    facts in this case support the existence of a duty of care akin to the one
    identified in <i>Attis</i>, at para. 66: “once the government has direct
    communication or interaction with the individual in the operation or implementation
    of a policy, a duty of care may arise, particularly where the safety of the
    individual is at risk.” See also <i>Sauer v.

    ); <i>Finney v. Barreau du Quebec</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17.  The duty of care
    alleged here belongs within the established category of a public authority’s
    negligent failure to act in accordance with an established policy where it
    is reasonably foreseeable that failure to do so will cause physical harm
    to the plaintiff:<i> </i>see, e.g., <i>Just v. British Columbia</i>, [1989]

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It

    if a full <i>Cooper-Anns</i> analysis were required, in my view, it is arguable
    that a duty of care should be recognized on the basis that there was a sufficiently “close
    and direct”
    relationship between Patrick Heaslip and Ontario that, on the facts pleaded,
    it is fair to require Ontario to be mindful of the legitimate interests of
    Patrick: <i>Cooper,</i> at paras. 32-34.  </p>

    consideration of the:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>expectations, representations, reliance, and the
    property or other interests involved.  Essentially…factors that allow us
    to evaluate the closeness of the relationship between the plaintiff and the

      C.J.C. stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The most basic factor upon which the proximity
    analysis fixes is whether there is a relationship between the alleged wrongdoer
    and the victim, usually described by the words “close and direct”.&nbsp; This
    factor is not concerned with how intimate the plaintiff and defendant were
    or with their physical proximity, so much as with whether the <i><span lang=EN-US

    or direct effect on the victim, such that the wrongdoer ought to have had
    the victim in mind as a person potentially harmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts alleged in the claim bring this case within the “close and direct” category
    identified in <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Hill</i>. It is alleged that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was made aware of both Patrick Heaslip’s life- threatening injuries
    and his urgent need for an air ambulance.  It would be clear that a failure
    to respond appropriately to that request could cause Patrick serious harm.  This
    gives rise to a situation where it is certainly arguable that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario ought reasonably to have had Patrick in mind as a person who could
    be harmed when it responded to the request for an air ambulance in the manner
    it did. </p>

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario argues that to recognize a duty of care would place the service provider
    in conflict with another person to whom a duty is already owed, namely the
    individual being carried in the air ambulance when the request was made on
    Patrick Heaslip’s behalf.  
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario submits that a duty of care should not be recognized due to this: <i>Syl
    Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D</i>., [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83, at paras. 49-50,
    55.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  To negate a duty of care, “the conflict must be between the novel
    duty proposed and an ‘overarching public duty’, and it must pose a real potential
    for negative policy consequences”: <i>Hill</i>, at para. 40.  On the facts
    pleaded,
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario itself has already determined how any potential conflict should be
    resolved: priority is to be given to those with life threatening injuries.  The
    complaint is that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario failed to follow its own policy, and I fail to see how
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario can claim that following its own policy would “pose a real potential
    for negative policy consequences”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I turn to the allegations contained in the claim that assert purely public
    law duties and that should be struck. To the extent that the appellants’ claim
    rests on the proposition that Ontario had failed to devote adequate resources
    to the provision of air ambulances, those allegations fail for the same reason
    that the claims in <i>Eliopoulos</i> and <i>Williams v. Canada (Attorney
    General), </i>2009 ONCA 378 (“<i>Williams</i>”), failed.  The plaintiffs
    in those cases each alleged that they had contracted an infectious disease
    as a result of the government’s negligent failure to control the spread of
    the disease.  In support of their arguments that the government owed them
    a duty of care in these cases, the plaintiffs could only point to the government’s
    duty to the public at large to control the spread of infectious diseases.  Claims
    of that nature alleging the government’s failure to provide a service or
    adopt a certain policy are fundamentally different than a claim based upon
    the negligent failure to respond to a specific request for a service that
    is being provided under an established policy. As stated in  <i>Williams</i>,
    at para 33: “[h]ere, no facts are pleaded to suggest that the plaintiff had
    any direct contact or dealings with Ontario, and the allegations of negligence
    relate to the manner in which Ontario dealt with the risk SARS posed to the
    public at large”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellants did not dispute the contention that some of the allegations
    in the statement of claim must fail on this ground.  In my view, paras 38(c),
    (d), (e) and (f), the words “draft, employ” in para. 38(j) and the word “establish”
    in para. 38(j2), must be struck out for this reason. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, accordingly, that with the exception of the allegations identified
    in the preceding paragraph, on the facts pleaded, it is arguable that there
    was sufficient proximity between
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and Patrick Heaslip to trigger a duty of care.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>2. Did the motion judge err in concluding
        that if any prima facie duty of care did arise it was negated by residual
        policy concerns?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also my view that, should a full <i>Cooper-Anns</i> analysis be required,
    the motion judge erred with respect to the second stage by concluding that
    any duty of care was negated by residual policy concerns. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s concerns regarding the risk of indeterminate liability suffers
    from the same difficulty as his duty of care analysis, namely, he failed
    to take into account the very specific nature of the claim.  As I have indicated,
    I would strike the broad allegations complaining of the failure to provide
    an adequate system of air ambulance services.  When stripped to its essentials,
    the allegation of specific acts of negligence in response to a specific request
    for air ambulance services, any risk of indeterminate liability evaporates. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    the motion judge erred in characterizing the claim as implicating a policy
    decision as opposed to an operational decision.  The facts pleaded bring
    this case within the category of operational negligence identified in <i>Just</i>,
    in which the Supreme Court held that where the government has made a policy
    decision to provide a service, a negligent failure to implement that policy
    at the operational level may be actionable when an individual member of the
    public suffers loss.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
