  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Seguin and Ms. Vanasse lived in a common law relationship for approximately
    12 years.  They have two children, aged 10 and 8.  When the relationship
    ended, Vanasse claimed spousal support, child support, and compensation for
    unjust enrichment.  At trial, Vanasse was awarded $5,472 per month in child
    support and $3,800 per month in spousal support until June 2015, for a total
    of approximately $111,000 per year in support.  She was also awarded a monetary
    award for unjust enrichment in the amount of $996,500.  In addition, the
    trial judge ordered
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Seguin to pay trial costs of $55,988.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only
    Vanasse’s compensation for unjust enrichment is in issue in this appeal<span style='color:black'>. </span>In
    order to establish unjust enrichment<span style='color:#454545'>, </span>there
    must be an enrichment<span style='color:#454545'>, </span>a corresponding
    deprivation<span

    enrichment<span style='color:#454545'>: </span>see <i>Peter </i><span

    periods in a couple’s relationship, but not during others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge found that there were three distinct periods during
    the couple’s cohabitation. In the first period, from approximately 1993-1997<span style='color:#505050'>, </span>she
    found no unjust enrichment<span style='color:black'>.  </span>There were
    no children of the relationship and both parties were involved in their careers.

    Seguin was developing a network operating system with a partner in a company
    known as FastLane<span
style='color:#505050'>.  </span>Vanasse was employed by CSIS.  In the second
    period, from March 1997-2000, the trial judge found that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Seguin was unjustly enriched as a result of Vanasse’s efforts.  Vanasse resigned
    her position at CSIS and relocated to

    Halifax because that is where
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Seguin moved his business.  Their two children were born and Vanasse devoted
    herself full-time to running the household and raising the children<span style='color:#505050'>. </span>The
    trial judge concluded that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Seguin could not have built up the company as he did but for Vanasse’s efforts.  The

    of approximately $11,000,000 from the sale of the company<span style='color:#505050'>.  </span>In
    the third period of the relationship<span style='color:#505050'>, </span>from
    September 2000 to March 2005, both parents were at home and again the trial
    judge found that there was no unjust enrichment<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found a period of unjust enrichment and that monetary compensation was in
    order, the trial judge acknowledged that the “value received” approach was
    appropriate.  The value received approach determines the value of the services
    rendered by the claimant to the common law spouse.  However, at para. 117
    of her reasons<span style='color:#505050'>, </span>she relied on <i>Nasser </i>v<span style='color:#505050'>. </span><i>Nasser-Mayer </i>(2000),
    5 R.F.L<span
style='color:black'>. </span>(5<sup>th</sup>) 100 (Ont<span style='color:black'>. </span>

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C<span
  style='color:black'>.</span>A.</st1:country-region>
    ) for the proposition that, in general<span style='color:#505050'>, </span>this
    court has endorsed a blurring of the “value received” and “value survived” approach
    at the quantification stage.  The “value survived” approach, which looks
    at what the increase in value of the assets was during the period of the
    unjust enrichment, is used when a constructive trust is established because
    a link has been demonstrated between the contribution that founds the action
    and the assets themselves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, the trial judge did not use the “value received” approach to quantification
    but instead determined the increase in the value of Seguin’s property during
    the period of unjust enrichment, namely the second period of cohabitation,
    and awarded Vanasse a monetary amount equal to half the increase in Seguin’s
    assets during this period less the benefits received by Vanasse as a result
    of the relationship.  After subtracting Seguin’s gifts to Vanasse of a half-interest
    in the matrimonial home worth approximately $215,000 and a spousal RRSP worth
    approximately $44,486 from Vanasse’s half-interest in the increase in Seguin’s
    net worth during the period of unjust enrichment, she ordered that Seguin
    pay Vanasse $996,500 as compensation for unjust enrichment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not appeal the trial judge’s finding of unjust enrichment during
    the second period of their cohabitation.  The only aspect of the trial judge’s
    award that Seguin appeals is her approach to calculating the amount Seguin
    should pay Vanasse.

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Seguin’s submission.  The approach adopted by the trial judge to quantify
    the compensation owed to Vanasse on the basis of unjust enrichment is precisely
    the approach this court held was incorrect in <i>Bell v. Bailey</i> (2001),
    20 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>) 272 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 35,<i> </i>and <i>Wylie

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Nasser</i> does not stand for the general proposition that the “value
    received” and “value survived” approaches can be blurred.  Rather, the result
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Nasser</i> was driven by the facts of that case.  Ms. Mayer-Nasser worked
    directly for her common law husband’s company for a period of time and spent
    virtually all the money she made outside the home on the household expenses
    enabling Mr. Nasser to keep a greater proportion of his assets.  That is
    not this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of this court in <i>Yackobeck v. Hartwig </i>(2000), 138 O.A.C.
    131, on which Vanasse relies, also does not support the proposition that
    the two approaches may ordinarily be blurred in calculating the amount owed
    upon a finding of unjust enrichment.  In that case the trial judge gave Ms.
    Yackobeck 30% of the value of the property based on her contribution to the
    domestic undertaking over fifteen years in which she worked both on and off
    the farm property including in Hartwig’s harness shop.  Any blurring of the “value
    survived” and “value received” approaches was again specific to the facts
    of that case: that case featured a direct connection to the property in question,
    but the strict application of the “value survived” approach would not have
    recognized Ms. Yackobeck’s contribution given the deterioration of the farm
    property after she left.  The main issue on appeal was the trial judge’s
    order for support.  In relation to the amount awarded for unjust enrichment
    the court simply endorsed the result arrived at by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that the correct approach was to determine the “value received” and perform
    a quantum meruit calculation, the value that each party received from the

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Seguin’s non-financial contributions to the relationship during the second
    period of cohabitation.  For example, she did not appear to take into account

    <st1:City

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Seguin cut back his hours and resigned his position as President of the company

    Seguin’s commitment to the business, friction with his partners, and reduced

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
