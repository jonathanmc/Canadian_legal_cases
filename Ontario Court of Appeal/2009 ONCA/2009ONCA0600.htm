'>The appellant, David Barry, brought an action against the respondent, Susan
      Nattress, after being bitten by one of Ms. Nattress’ dogs on October 15,
      1997.  The trial was conducted by Boyko J., sitting with a jury.    </span></p>

'>The jury found Mr. Barry to be 100% at fault in causing or contributing to
      the damages resulting from the dog biting incident.  It gave four reasons
      for so finding:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         Based on the appellant’s own testimony,
    he exhausted his “invitation to knock” at either the front door or the first
    side door on the west side of the property.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         The appellant ignored the respondent’s
    warning by failing to stop and confirm the respondent’s verbal instructions;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         The appellant ignored the warnings of
    the dogs and the respondent when he heard intermittent barking;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.         The appellant continued to advance towards
    the dog and the respondent and reached out with his left hand, which could
    have been construed as an aggressive gesture by the dog.</p>

'> Further, the jury found that it was not as a result of the dog biting incident
      that Mr. Barry sustained a herniated disc requiring surgery in November
      1997.  The jury assessed general damages for injuries to Mr. Barry’s abdomen
      and forearm at $1,000; it assessed $0 for loss of income, both past and
      future.       </span></p>

'>Mr. Barry appeals.  He pursues two grounds of appeal before this court.  First,
      he submits that the trial judge erred in her charge on the issue of causation
      (the “causation issue”).  Second, he argues that the finding that he was
      100% at fault for the incident cannot stand (the “apportionment issue”).  He
      asks that the judgment below be set aside and a new trial be ordered.    </span></p>

'>In October 1997, the appellant was canvassing door-to-door in the Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Westwood as part of his campaign for the upcoming municipal election.  On
    arriving at the respondent’s home, he walked to the side of the home with
    the goal of contacting the homeowner.  A sign on the home warned “Beware
    of Dog”.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>The respondent was in the backyard of her home with her three dogs, none of
      which was leashed or penned.  The respondent’s evidence was that she called
      out to the appellant, warning him not to come closer until she put the
      dogs in their pen.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>The appellant continued to walk towards the respondent.  One of the respondent’s
      dogs
    – Sadie – was between the two of them.  The appellant then raised his left
    hand, intending to give the respondent his business card and/or a pamphlet
    that he was handing out.  Sadie jumped up and bit him.  According to the
    appellant, the force of the impact slammed him into a car in the driveway.  He
    testified that he did not hear the dogs barking or the respondent warning
    him to stay where he was.  </span></p>

'>The appellant has a history of back problems.  In 1985, he had a herniated
      disc that was operated on in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Edmonton.  He was off work for a month at that time and recovered well.  His
    back pain flared up in 1988 and then he was pain-free until the fall of 1997.  In
    late September of 1997 – about two weeks before the dog biting incident – he
    played a game of softball.  After the game, he suffered pain in his back
    and by October 10, 1997, he was in so much pain that he decided to go to
    the hospital.  He attempted to drive himself there but the pain was so severe
    that he had to call an ambulance for transportation. </span></p>

'>On October 14, 1997 – the day before the dog biting incident – he visited his
      family physician.  After examining the appellant, the doctor noted that
      the appellant might have a herniated disc.</span></p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>Counsel for the appellant (who was not trial counsel), concedes that if this
      court finds against him on the apportionment issue, it is a full answer
      to this appeal.  Thus, we begin by considering that issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the appellant acknowledges that the wording of the question put to the jury
    on the apportionment issue is correct, he contends that the instruction was
    in error because it focused on causation, not fault.  He says this would
    have caused the jury to understand that they were to apportion liability
    based on the degree of causation attributable to the parties and not based
    on their respective fault.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    begin by noting that the appellant made no objection at trial to the manner
    in which the trial judge charged the jury on the matter of apportionment.  We
    also note that the trial judge’s instruction raised considerations of fault
    and used the language of the legislation.  I<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>n our view, the trial judge made no error
    in her instructions on the issue of apportionment.  The charge reflects the
    provisions of s. 2(3) of the <i>Dog Owner’s Liability Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990,
    c. D.16, which provides that “t</span>he court shall reduce the damages awarded
    in proportion to the degree, if any, to which the fault or negligence of
    the plaintiff caused or contributed to the damages.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, reading the charge as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury
    understood its task.  Indeed, its answers to the question of apportionment – which
    are recited above - show that the jury was focused on the appellant’s conduct
    and the matter of fault.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject the argument that it was not open to the jury, as a matter of law,
    to attribute 100% of the fault to the appellant.  There is nothing in the
    wording of s. 2(3) that limits the jury in that fashion.  Accordingly, we
    are of the view that it was open to the jury to find the appellant 100% at
    fault for causing or contributing to the damages he suffered.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the jury’s apportionment of liability was based on its findings of fact.  Those
    findings were fully available to the jury, on the record, and we do not accept
    that they are so plainly unreasonable and unjust that they should be set
    aside.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of our conclusion on the apportionment issue, it is unnecessary to
    consider the causation issue.  </p>
