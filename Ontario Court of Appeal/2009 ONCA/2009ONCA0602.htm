  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General seeks leave to appeal and if leave be granted, appeals the
    sentence of two years probation imposed on K.L., a young person convicted
    of assault causing bodily harm, a crime that the sentencing Youth Court Judge
    designated a serious violent offence. Crown counsel seeks the imposition
    of a sentence that consists of a custody and supervision order for six months,
    including four months of open custody and two months of community supervision,
    and thereafter a period of probation on terms similar to those imposed by
    the sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances of the respondent’s offence may be shortly stated. The respondent,
    then 15 ½ years old, was one of a group of youths who went to a commercial
    plaza to confront other youths who worked there. There had been some prior
    dispute between the groups that originated in a racially-motivated incident
    at a local high school. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant, an 18 year-old, was lured from his place of employment by a
    telephone call and challenged to a fight. The complainant knew none of the
    respondent’s group and had no connection to the earlier dispute, whatever
    it may have been. The complainant intervened when one of K.L.’s group began
    to physically abuse a female who had accompanied the complainant outside. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K.L.
    and two others jumped the complainant. K.L. knocked the complainant unconscious
    with a blow to the jaw. He then continued to punch and kick the unconscious
    and prone complainant in the head and stomach. The complainant suffered a
    broken jaw and concussion, missed two months of work and continued to exhibit
    several physical and psychological symptoms months after the attack. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K.L.
    is a first offender, now 17 years-old. He has a close relationship with his
    mother and enjoys substantial support from his immediate and extended family.
    He has abused alcohol, smoked marijuana and has apparently experimented with
    other drugs. His educational achievements are modest, though improving, and
    reflected, at least in the past, frequent absences and several suspensions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the sentencing judge the prosecutor sought a custodial sentence of six months
    open or four months closed custody followed by a lengthy period of probation.
    Counsel for K.L. sought a period of probation with strict conditions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel takes the position that the sentence imposed is at once reflective
    of errors in principle and demonstrably unfit. The errors alleged include
    a misapplication of the proportionality principle in s. 38(2) of the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act </i>(<i>YCJA</i>), and a failure to consider the intention
    underlying s. 42(5) of the <i>YCJA</i> that young persons who commit serious
    violent offences are to receive custodial sentences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that the sentence imposed, a probationary term, was a legally
    available sentencing option open to the sentencing judge. That said, we are
    of the view that a probationary term, in the circumstances of this case,
    fails to pay heed to the proportionality principle expressed in s. 38(2)(c)
    of the <i>YCJA</i>. At bottom, this sentence must be proportionate to the
    seriousness of the offence and the degree of K.L.’s responsibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was the principal, the person who took and maintained the initiative.
    He administered a severe and protracted assault on the complainant who, rendered
    unconscious, was for all practical purposes defenceless. The injuries caused
    were significant both in their immediate and extended consequences. The conduct
    involved pre-concerted activity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the circumstances of this offence and this offender require a custodial
    sentence. A fit disposition is a sentence that includes open custody, supervision
    in the community and a term of probation. The respondent has already satisfactorily
    completed more than 7 months of probationary supervision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence
    below set aside. In its place is substituted a sentence that is comprised
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      four
    months in open custody; followed by </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      two
    months of community supervision; followed by </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      probation
    for six months on the terms imposed by the sentencing judge.</p>
