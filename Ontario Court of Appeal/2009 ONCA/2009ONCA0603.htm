    Mr. Hilton was working for Ford, K &amp; S approached him about working for
    it.  Mr. Hilton told K &amp; S that he had responsibilities as a joint custodial
    parent of his daughter and that he needed to be in the Windsor-Detroit area
    on alternating weeks.  After being assured that his childcare responsibilities
    could be accommodated, Mr. Hilton agreed to accept a position and left his

    a brief, one-page letter dated April 6, 2006, Mr. Hilton was offered the
    position of Vice-President in Charge of Operations.  The letter set out his
    base salary, car allowance, vacation entitlement and bonus.  It stated that
    the offer would serve as a 2 and a half year contract and, thereafter, employment
    would be the “same” as all other K &amp; S employees.  It then stated that
    K &amp; S is an “at will” employer and, therefore, either party could sever
    the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.  </p>

    April 11, 2006, Mr. Hilton signed the letter and FAXed it back to K &amp; S.  He
    became a commuter employee, travelling from his home in Tecumseh.  He often
    worked from home or from the K &amp;
    S office in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville.  He was treated as a Canadian employee working in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan.  He was placed on K &amp; S’s Canadian payroll and treated similarly
    to other Canadian commuter employees who were on the Canadian payroll.  His
    pay cheque was issued from the Bank of Montreal in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  He was paid in Canadian dollars through K
    &amp; S’s subsidiary in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville.  Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance deductions were taken
    from his pay and remitted to the Canadian government on his behalf.  He was
    given a Canadian blackberry with a Canadian phone number.  All health and
    insurance benefits were from Canadian providers.  </p>

    appeals.  The foundation of its appeal is its contention that the employment
    relationship is governed by
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Michigan law, a matter which the motion judge failed to recognize and properly
    consider.  Based on its assertion that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan law governs, it argues that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
    lacks jurisdiction over the action and, in any event,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Michigan is the more convenient forum.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, this argument must fail.  The motion judge was alive to the question
    of what law governed this relationship.  But, as he noted, the one page letter
    which K &amp; S relies on as the “contract”
    does not stipulate the governing law.  We note also that it does not contain
    a “whole contract” provision or anything akin to that.  The question of what
    law governs Mr. Hilton’s employment relationship is a live one that must
    be decided at trial.  In light of this, it cannot be said that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan law applies and the motion judge did not err in failing to treat
    it as the governing law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts, as set out by the motion judge in paras. 5 and 7 of his reasons, make
    it clear that there is a real and substantial connection between the present
    action and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Those facts, in conjunction with the motion judge’s unassailable
    determination that the plaintiff would lose a juridical advantage if the
    action were tried in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan, also demonstrate that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario is the more convenient forum.  Paragraphs 5 and 7 read as follows:</p>
