    the context of the trial record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For

  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result of an earlier incident, the appellant was subject to a probation
    order, a term of which prohibited him from contact with the complainant without
    her written consent.  In February 2007, the complainant provided that (revocable)
    consent to the appellant’s probation officer.  As a result, the appellant
    and the complainant began living together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 1, 2007, the appellant arranged to rent an apartment on a month-to-month
    tenancy.  The appellant moved into the apartment.  The complainant moved
    in the next day.  They lived together in a spousal relationship.  The appellant
    paid the rent.  The complainant paid, or was to pay, other household expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early afternoon of June 26, 2007, the complainant revoked her consent
    to contact with the appellant.  She notified the appellant’s probation officer
    of her revocation by telephone.  The probation officer called the police.  The
    police arrived about twenty to thirty minutes later and told the appellant
    to leave the apartment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant became angry with the police.  He testified that his anger was
    not a reaction to the reinstatement of the no contact order, but a reasonable
    reaction to what he considered to be an unreasonable police demand that he
    should leave what he saw as &quot;his&quot;
    apartment.  He told the police, that since he paid the rent, he was the tenant
    and the complainant was not.  In his view, she should be the one to leave.  Despite
    the appellant’s protestations, the police removed him from the apartment.  They
    did not lay any charges against him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant telephoned his lawyer.  Later in the afternoon, he also called
    two police staff sergeants.  After those conversations, the appellant called
    the police asking them to remove the complainant from “his” apartment.  He
    returned to the area outside the apartment where he waited for the police
    for about fifteen minutes.  The police did not arrive.  Since the complainant’s
    car was not at the apartment, and the appellant believed that meant that
    the complainant was not there, he entered the apartment. <b> </b>Sometime
    later, as the police were arriving at the apartment, the complainant returned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the course of discussions about the appellant’s position that he was the
    tenant of the apartment, the complainant told the police for the first time
    that the appellant had sexually assaulted her earlier that day, June 26.  As
    well, she alleged that he physically assaulted her on May 26, 2007.  On the
    basis of those allegations, the police charged the appellant with the offences
    that were before the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the complainant testified that, the appellant told her on May 26,
    2007, as he had on many earlier occasions, that he wanted her to leave the
    apartment.  To that end, the appellant began gathering some of the complainant’s
    belongings and headed to the door with the apparent intention of putting
    them outside.  The complainant grabbed the appellant’s shirt.  She testified
    that the appellant then punched her and took her to the floor, at which point
    the appellant “put his foot on my head and he started kicking me and punching
    me and then, then I kicked him back”.  The complainant testified that, during
    the assault, the appellant hit her several times on her right side with his
    closed right hand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant said she was able to get up, but the assault resumed.  She testified
    that the appellant threw her onto the bed and pressed his elbow “in the little
    V spot in [her] throat” so that she could not breathe.  The complainant testified
    that, from this position, she bit the appellant on the chest.  She said the
    appellant then backed off, but put both his hands over her mouth.  Nonetheless,
    the complainant managed to break free.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    that point, the complainant tried to leave the apartment.  She said that
    the appellant told her she could not leave because she would tell the police
    about the assault and, if she did, he would put her into intensive care.  The
    complainant testified that the appellant hit her again, this time with a
    hard forceful slap to the right side of her face.  In describing the slap,
    the complainant pointed to the left side of her face.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified in-chief that, immediately after this altercation,
    she observed that she had a cut in her eye, a black eye, and the whole right
    side of her face was swollen.  She also said that she suffered “a saucer
    pan size bruise on [her] right side” above her
    “right kidney”, her left ear was “all black and blue”, she had seven or eight
    bumps on the right side of her head (from the kicking), and bruises on her
    ribs.  In cross-examination, the complainant said her injuries were more
    extensive, including bruises “everywhere”.  However, she continued to maintain
    that the bruises were all on her right side, except for her bruised left
    ear.  The complainant produced a photograph of herself that she said showed
    a “bump” or bruises.  The photograph only showed the <u>left</u> side of
    the complainant’s face.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified that “couldn’t move for about a week” and she could
    not sleep on her right side as a result of her injuries.  She said she did
    not seek medical attention because the appellant warned her against doing
    so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant gave different statements about what she did after the May 26
    incident.  In her videotaped statement the day after the appellant’s arrest
    in June, the complainant told the police that she left the apartment after
    the incident and drove around.  She also told the police that she telephoned
    her father the next morning and that her father gave her money, which she
    used to stay at the Budget Inn for the next two days.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in examination-in-chief at trial, the complainant testified that she left
    the apartment after the appellant fell asleep.  She said that she went out
    to her car and returned half an hour later when she realized she had “no
    place to go.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    cross-examined on the discrepancy between her videotaped statement and her
    evidence-in-chief, the complainant admitted that it was not true that she
    had stayed at the Budget Inn for the two days following the May incident.  Instead,
    she testified that she went to the Budget Inn as soon as the appellant fell
    asleep.  When she realized that she did not have enough money to rent a room,
    she returned to the apartment where she slept with the appellant.  The complainant
    tried to reconcile this evidence with her evidence-in-chief by saying that
    she had gone out to the car, then gone to the Budget Inn, then returned home.  She
    said she did call her father the next morning and that, while her father
    gave her money, she decided not to use it to stay at the Budget Inn.  Instead,
    she returned to the apartment because “[she] wasn’t taking the chances of
    leaving and not being able to, to get back in.”<b>  </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified.  He agreed that he had persistently told the complainant
    that he wanted her to leave.  He denied the May 26 assault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second assault was alleged to have taken place on June 26, 2007.  The complainant
    and appellant testified that they had barely spoken to each other for about
    four days.  At that point, their relationship appeared, by all accounts,
    to be tenuous at best.  The complainant testified that, when she called the
    appellant’s probation officer to revoke her consent to contact, she did so
    without the appellant’s knowledge while he was in the shower.  The complainant
    testified that, after his shower, the appellant emerged naked from their
    bedroom and sat down cross-legged beside her on the living room couch; he
    then asked her to “play with” him.  The complainant testified that, even
    though she responded by telling the appellant to<b> </b>leave her alone,
    he put his hands on her breasts and tried to put his hand up her shorts.  She
    said that he continued to do so for about five minutes before desisting and
    returning to their bedroom.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellant testified that on June 26, he told the complainant their
    relationship was over and he was leaving.  She became agitated.  He got into
    the shower.  The appellant testified that, when he emerged from the shower
    and went into the living room, the complainant told him that she had called
    his probation officer to revoke her consent.  Not believing her, the appellant
    called the probation officer, who gave no indication of having received such
    a call.  The appellant obtained what he believed to be confirmation that
    the complainant had not tried to retract her consent.  He then approached
    the complainant with the sexual invitation, “[d]o you want to play”.  The
    appellant testified that, when the complainant responded in the negative,
    he returned to his bedroom to shave. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    probation officer testified the appellant called him shortly after the probation
    officer had called the police and that he had kept the appellant on the telephone
    for 26 minutes to give the police time to arrive.  </p>
  <h4>Trial Judge’s Reasons</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge began his reasons by observing that “[t]his is not an easy case
    to decide.”  He stated that one of the real issues was “who rented the apartment” and
    whether, in wanting the complainant to leave the apartment, the appellant
    committed the offences alleged in the indictment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    brief reasons, the trial judge acknowledged the “he said/she said” nature
    of the evidence.  He observed there “is really the evidence of the complainant” giving
    one version, and the evidence of the appellant “flatly denying what she said.”  The
    trial judge set out the principles from <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
    742.  He acknowledged that there were inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    evidence.  He identified one inconsistency, concerning whether the complainant
    had or had not rented a motel room on the night of May 26.  The trial judge
    did not resolve that inconsistency.  He concluded that all the inconsistencies “are
    collateral matters.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    stating that it was “difficult for the court to believe that the complainant
    manufactured this evidence”, the trial judge commented that it was “striking”
    that the complainant’s evidence was “graphic”.  In addition to placing reliance
    on the complainant’s descriptors and demeanour, the trial judge concluded
    that the evidence of the neighbour, about seeing a bruise on the complainant’s
    body, and the photograph, alleged to depict bruising on the complainant’s
    face, supported the complainant’s evidence of an assault on May 26.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    weighing the evidence of the appellant, the trial judge “[took] into account” the
    appellant’s “adamant” and “vehement” attitude and “anger” at the time the
    police removed him from his apartment.  The trial judge decided that the “demeanour
    of the complainant” and “the angry conduct of the accused when he was dealing
    with the police” combined “to buttress the credibility of the complainant”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    convicting the appellant of sexual assault in relation to the June 26 incident,
    the trial judge again described the complainant’s evidence as “graphic”.  He
    noted that the appellant conceded his
    “invitation to play” to the complainant and that the parties had “not had
    much to do with one another for some period of time” before that day.  He
    concluded that “there was an invasion of the privacy of the complainant … without
    her consent”, and, accordingly, that the appellant was guilty of sexual assault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the trial judge convicted the appellant of the offences now under
    appeal.  The trial judge expressed a reasonable doubt about the charge of
    breach of a probation order and acquitted the appellant on that count. </p>
  <h4>Issues</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises two issues regarding the sufficiency of the trial judge’s
    reasons. First, he argues that the reasons do not adequately explain to him
    why he was convicted and, second, they do not allow for meaningful appellate
    review.  He argues that the trial judge’s failure to give reasons for rejecting
    the evidence of the appellant and his failure to analyze the evidence of
    the complainant, inhibit these two functions of reasons for judgment.  </p>
  <h4>Analysis<i><span style='font-weight:normal'>         </span></i></h4>
  <h4><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Approach </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has cautioned appellate courts about the limited
    parameters of appellate review based on a challenge to the sufficiency of
    a trial judge’s reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insufficiency
    of reasons is not a stand-alone ground of appeal.  In <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>,
    [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3at para. 25, the Supreme Court quoted from <i>R. v. Braich</i>,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 903, which, in turn, cited the principle from para. 33 of <i>Sheppard</i>,<i> </i>that “the
    appellant must show not only that there is a deficiency in the reasons, but
    that this deficiency has occasioned prejudice to the exercise of his or her
    legal right to an appeal in a criminal case”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    trial judge’s reasons are sufficient if they explain to the parties why the
    decision was made, provide public accountability, and permit appellate review:
    see <i>R.E.M.</i>, at paras. 11 and 15.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    deciding whether reasons are sufficient, appellate courts are instructed
    to take a functional approach asking whether the trial reasons achieved the
    three purposes of explanation, accountability and reviewability.  Even if
    the reasons, standing alone, do not satisfy their intended functions, the
    appellate court must turn to the trial record and its context to identify
    and attempt to communicate the basis for how and why the trial judge arrived
    at the decision.  Only if that basis cannot be identified from the record
    will the appellate court order a new trial: see <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002]
    1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 28 and 50.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In<i> R.
      v. Dinardo</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, <span
lang=EN-US>Charron J.</span> underscored the importance of a trial judge’s credibility
      findings to the sufficiency of reasons.  She observed at para. 26 that
    “[n]evertheless, a failure to sufficiently articulate how credibility concerns
    were resolved may constitute reversible error”.  Further, at para. 29, Charron
    J. noted that, in the context of the focus on the complainant’s credibility
    and the testimony of the accused denying the allegations, “it was incumbent
    upon the trial judge to explain, even in succinct terms, how he resolved
    these difficulties to reach a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the circumstances of that case, the court reasoned at para. 31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While it was open to the trial judge to conclude
    that he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused,
    it was not open him to do so without explaining how he reconciled the complainant’s
    inconsistent testimony, particularly in light of the accused’s own evidence
    denying her allegations. <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court in <i>R.E.M.</i> also specifically commented about the approach to
    credibility findings in determining the sufficiency of reasons.  The court
    noted at paras. 49 and 48 the “delicate” nature of credibility findings and
    the difficulties faced by trial judges in articulating and verbalizing the “complex
    intermingling of impressions” that underlie such determinations.  <i>R.E.M.</i> referred
    to <i>Dinardo</i> regarding the sufficiency of credibility findings and noted
    at para. 50 that credibility findings, which
    “must be made with regard to the other evidence”, “may require at least some
    reference to the contradictory evidence.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    coming to a conclusion about the sufficiency of reasons challenged on the
    basis of credibility issues, an appellate court will review the reasons in
    the context of the whole of the record and the circumstances of the case
    to determine from this review the basis for the trial judge’s credibility
    findings.  As McLachlin C.J. explained the approach at para. 55 of<i> R.E.M.</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The appellate court, proceeding with deference,
    must ask itself whether the reasons, considered with the evidentiary record,
    the submissions of counsel and the live issues at the trial, reveals the
    basis for the verdict reached.  It must look at the reasons in their entire
    context.  It must ask itself whether, viewed thus, the trial judge appears
    to have seized the substance of the critical issues on the trial.  If the
    evidence is contradictory or confusing, the appellate court should ask whether
    the trial judge appears to have recognized and dealt with the contradictions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the court also explained at para. 56 that the trial judge need not “describe
    every consideration leading to a finding of credibility” and that “[r]easonable
    inferences need not be spelled out.”  Indeed, it is important to note that
    a trial judge is under no obligation to deal with every piece of evidence
    in arriving at his or her factual findings.  Nonetheless, the court further
    observed, at para. 57, that to permit meaningful appellate review, reasons
    must disclose “the foundation of the conviction.”</p>
  <h4><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Application to this Case</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant has satisfied me that the application of the above principles leads
    to the conclusion that a new trial is necessary in this case.  I arrive at
    this conclusion because, even after a consideration of the reasons and the
    entirety of the record considered in context, I am unable to explain how
    the trial judge resolved the challenges to the complainant’s credibility
    and reliability in order to convict the appellant.  Further, in my view,
    even when considered in their full context, the reasons do not provide the
    foundation of factual findings necessary to permit appellate review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record discloses significant inconsistencies and improbabilities raised by
    the complainant’s evidence.  The trial judge identified only one inconsistency.  That
    inconsistency concerned the night of May 26 and the complainant’s subsequent
    whereabouts.  The trial judge did not explain how he resolved this inconsistency.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    his reasons did not deal with the other inconsistencies and challenges to
    the complainant’s evidence.  In particular, there was a significant conflict
    in the complainant’s evidence about what injuries she allegedly suffered
    on May 26.  The complainant testified about highly visible injuries, including
    a black eye and a swollen face.  She said her injuries were so extensive
    that they significantly affected her ability to move and sleep for a week.  Yet
    her neighbour noticed nothing unusual about the complainant when she saw
    her two or three days after May 26.  Specifically, the neighbour gave no
    evidence of any injuries to the complainant’s face.  The neighbour supported
    the complainant’s evidence only to the extent of testifying that the complainant
    had shown her a large bruise on her right side.  It was this piece of evidence
    that led the trial judge to believe “that the complainant indeed was telling
    the truth.”  However, the trial judge came to this conclusion without either
    mentioning or resolving the significant inconsistencies between the complainant’s
    stated injuries and those observed by the neighbour.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also referred to the photographs.  However, even assuming the
    trial judge was entitled to conclude that the photographs showed discolouration
    of the complainant’s skin, his reasons do not address the significant point
    that the photographs depict the left rather than her right side of the complainant’s
    body.  The complainant’s evidence initially focused exclusively on injuries
    to her right side.  She appeared to change her evidence to attest to left-sided
    injuries only when she realized that the photograph did not show her right
    side.  While, of course, it was open to the trial judge to accept some parts
    of the complainant’s evidence and not others, it was incumbent upon him to
    explain what evidence he accepted and why he chose to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    the trial judge did not address inconsistencies between the complainant’s
    videotaped statement and her trial evidence, including the absence of reference
    in her earlier statement to the appellant having his hands over her mouth,
    or to the complainant biting the appellant. Nor did the reasons consider
    the logistical implausibility of the complainant’s testimony, particularly
    her testimony that the appellant kicked her several times while standing
    on her head.  Indeed, the trial judge does not explain why the implausibility
    of certain aspects of the complainant’s evidence did not reflect on the reliability
    of the more plausible parts of her evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    well, the reasons did not resolve contradictions between the complainant’s
    police statement, in which she said that the May 26 incident began with the
    appellant dumping out her purse, and her trial testimony, in which she said
    that the incident began when the appellant headed to the door with some of
    her belongings.  The reasons also did not address the reliability of the
    complainant’s evidence.  The complainant denied asking the probation officer
    to have the appellant removed from the apartment.  The probation officer
    testified that the complainant did ask that the appellant be removed from
    the apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the trial judge’s reasons characterized the rent issue as the “real”
    issue.  While this may have given undue weight to the legal question of the
    tenancy, in my view the trial judge’s reasons ought to have at least explained
    his conclusion on the issue that he saw as significant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    regarding the issue of consent to the June 26 sexual conduct, the trial judge
    did not address the incident in the context of the spousal relationship,
    the telephone calls with the probation officer, and the timing of any sexual
    touching and objection.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    view of the number and nature of the inconsistencies and other challenges
    to the complainant’s evidence, combined with the complainant’s admitted objective
    of securing occupation of the apartment and her possessions, the trial judge
    was obliged to explain how he arrived at his decision.  This required some
    explanation of what he believed and, more importantly, what he did not believe
    or what did not raise a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt.  Where
    the credibility of the complainant was the central issue, it was insufficient
    to dismiss the numerous problems by labelling them
    “collateral”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, even recognizing that there is no obligation on a trial judge to
    deal with every piece of evidence, without some explanation why the inconsistencies,
    contradictions and implausibility of the complainant’s testimony did not
    affect her credibility or reliability, the trial judge’s reasons do not adequately
    explain the appellant’s convictions, nor do they allow for appellate review.  As
    Charron J. said in <i>Dinardo</i> at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…the questions expose the very real obstacle to
    appellate review posed by the trial judge’s failure to state explicitly why
    he accepted the complainant's evidence despite its difficulties.... Without
    some explanation in his reasons for judgment, there is simply no way to know
    how the trial judge satisfied himself that the complainant was a credible
    witness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are also problems with the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s evidence.  He
    rejected his evidence largely because the appellant took a forceful position
    with the police when they asked him to leave the apartment.  The trial judge
    does not explain how the appellant’s “adamant” belief in his tenancy negatively
    affected his credibility regarding the circumstances of the alleged assaults.  The
    reasons do not disclose any consideration of the appellant’s explanation
    that he did not understand why he should be the one to leave the apartment
    when, in his view, he was the tenant of the premises.  After reviewing the
    whole of the record, I am unable to explain the basis for the conclusion
    that the appellant’s evidence “could not reasonably be true”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Result</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    conclusion, a consideration of the reasons and the trial record as a whole
    reviewed in context does not disclose an explanation for the appellant’s
    convictions and the absence of an explanation impedes the appellant’s ability
    to exercise his right to appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order
    a new trial.</p>
