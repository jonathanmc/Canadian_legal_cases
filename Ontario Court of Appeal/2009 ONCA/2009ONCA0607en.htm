  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Retirement
    gratuities” are owed to some teachers who were transferred first from a public
    school board to a separate school board in 1986, and then from a French language
    section of a separate school board to a French language separate school board
    in 1997.  A retirement gratuity represents the amount of unused leave that
    a teacher has accumulated during his or her career, and thus is eligible
    to be paid for.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Near North District School Board (“Near North”), and the respondent,
    Conseil Scolaire de district du Nord-Est (“Nord-Est”), agree that monies
    are owed to Conseil Scolaire de district Catholique Franco-Nord (“Franco-Nord”).  These
    monies are required by Franco-Nord to pay the public school portion of retirement
    gratuities for employees who transferred from the public school system and
    are now working for Franco-Nord.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue to be determined is whether Near North is responsible to reimburse
    Franco-Nord for the payment of 94.23% of those gratuities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was asked to decide two questions provided by the parties and
    incorporated into the consent order of Justice Hoy.  Those two questions
    are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)         In 1998, during the distribution of
    assets and liabilities required under the <i>Education Act</i>, did the respondents
    [Nord-Est and Near North<span lang=EN-US>] conclude a valid and enforceable
    agreement within the meaning of subsection 135(26.1) of the </span><i>Education
    Act</i>, to share the liability for paying to the applicant [Franco Nord]
    the retirement gratuities of the applicant’s [Franco Nord’s] teaching staff
    in relation to the period prior to 1986?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)         If so, what were the proportionate shares
    provided for in that agreement?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge determined that there was no agreement between the parties within
    the meaning of section 135(26.1) of the <i>Education Act</i>, R.S.O. c. E.2,
    and therefore the answer to the first question was “no”.  However, she held
    that there was an agreement outside the scope of section 135 and therefore
    monies were payable by Near North to Franco-Nord.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, prior to 1986, public school boards received full public funding
    through the end of high school.  Separate school boards received public funding
    only until the end of Grade 10.  Each of the public and separate school boards
    had French language sections that were part of those boards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Separate
    school boards became eligible to receive full funding through the end of
    high school in 1986, with the passing of <i>An Act to amend the Education
    Act</i>, S.O. 1986, c.21.  This act allowed separate school boards to elect
    to perform the duties of a public school board, and thus be eligible to receive
    full funding.  Teachers who would, as a result, no longer be required in
    the public system would be transferred to fill the new positions available
    in those separate school boards that decided to expand their functions.  The
    Nipissing District Roman Catholic Separate School Board elected to exercise
    the functions of a public school board in 1986.  As a result, it began to
    employ several francophone teachers who had been employed by the Nipissing
    Board of Education, a public school board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Public
    school boards that transferred teachers to newly expanded separate schools
    were statutorily obligated to retain responsibility for a portion of the
    retirement gratuities payable to the transferred teachers.  As teachers are
    able to carry over their leave entitlements from one year to the next, the
    retirement gratuity can only be calculated at the end of a teacher’s career,
    rather than at the end of each school year.  When the teachers were transferred
    from the Nippissing Board of Education to the Nipissing District Roman Catholic
    Separate Board, the “sending” public school board was required to reimburse
    the “receiving” separate school board for any retirement gratuities to be
    paid to the transferred teachers in proportion to the length of time they
    were at the public board.  The Nipissing Board of Education elected to pay
    this amount upon the retirement of each of the transferred teachers, rather
    than make an estimated lump sum payment at the time of the transfer.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    arrangement remained in place until the <i>Education Act</i> was substantially
    amended in 1997 by the

    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <i>Fewer</i><i>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    School</i><i> Boards Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c. 31.  This Act, which took
    effect on January 1, 1998, amalgamated several school boards to create “district” school
    boards.  It also created, for the first time, a number of French language
    school boards, both public and separate.  As a result of these changes: </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'>(1)       Nord-Est, a French language public school board,
    replaced the French language section of the Nipissing Board of Education
    (as well as a number of other French language sections of public school boards); </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'>(2)       Near North, an English language public school board,
    replaced the English language Nipissing Board of Education (as well as two
    other public school boards); and</p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'>(3)       Franco-Nord, a French language separate
    school board, replaced the French-language section of the Nipissing District
    Roman Catholic Separate School Board, to which the affected teachers had
    been transferred in 1986. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    process of reorganizing the existing school boards into new district boards
    was overseen by the Education Improvement Commission (“EIC”).  This process
    involved the transfer of assets and liabilities from former school boards
    to the new district school boards, including the newly-created French language
    public and separate district school boards.  Among the liabilities held by
    the Nipissing Board of Education were the remaining retirement gratuities
    for teachers who had been transferred to the Nipissing District Roman Catholic
    Separate School Board and who had not yet retired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    of 1998, the inventory prepared by one of Near North’s predecessor boards
    estimated the amount of $252,231 as the liability accrued by the former Nipissing
    Board of Education for the unfunded retirement gratuities.  Neither Near
    North nor Nord-Est made any inquiries concerning the accuracy of this figure.  It
    was clear, however, that this sum was merely an estimate, as the actual figure
    depends on a number of factors unknown until an employee retires.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the former Nipissing Board of Education and its French-language section would
    now belong to different school boards, the transfer of the Nipissing Board
    of Education’s assets and liabilities required agreements between Near North
    and Nord-Est as to how to split the assets and liabilities.  A Joint Request
    was submitted to the EIC by Near North, and approved by Nord-Est, for the
    transfer of all assets and liabilities of the school boards that they were
    replacing.  With respect to the retirement gratuities, Near North and Nord
    Est each agreed to bear their proportionate share of the cost of any retirement
    gratuities <span style='color:black'>assumed by the former Nipissing Board
    of Education. </span>On August 31, 1998, the EIC issued an order giving effect
    to the Joint Request between Nord-Est and Near North.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998 and 1999, Franco-Nord paid out retirement gratuities to several transferred
    teachers and sought and obtained reimbursement from Near North for over $300,000.  In
    2000 and 2001, Franco-Nord submitted five additional invoices, totalling
    over $220,000, which Near North refused to pay on the basis that it was not
    liable pursuant to s. 135(26). Franco-Nord then sought payment form Nord-Est,
    which also refused to pay on the basis that Near North had agreed to assume
    primary responsibility for the payment of retirement gratuities in their
    agreement made under s. 135(26.1). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 21, 2003, Franco-Nord issued a Notice of Application against Nord-Est.  The
    estimate as of May 28, 2007 for the public portion of the retirement gratuities
    payable to the employees of Franco-Nord who had already retired was $759,068.84.  Franco-Nord
    estimated that the public portion of retirement gratuities for twelve employees
    of Franco-Nord who had not yet retired would be approximately $66,692.09.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    order was made on October 7, 2003, on consent, adding Near North as a defendant
    to the action, and adjourning the matter for a trial of an issue pursuant
    to Rule 38.10(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure.  </i>As noted above,
    at para. 4, the issues to be determined at trial were<i> </i>whether Near
    North and Nord-Est had concluded a valid agreement pursuant to s. 135(26.1)
    of the <i>Education Act</i> so as to require Near North to shoulder a portion
    of the retirement gratuities owing to Franco-Nord, and if so, what proportion
    of those gratuities were Near North and Nord-Est each responsible for.    </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION ON THE TRIAL OF THE ISSUE</span><u><span lang=EN-US> </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial, Near North argued that it was not liable to pay any portion of
    the retirement gratuities owing to Franco-Nord.  It claimed that the agreement
    it had concluded with Nord-Est, in which the two boards each agreed to bear
    their proportionate share of the retirement gratuities owing to Franco-Nord,
    was not an agreement pursuant to s. 135(26.1) of the <i>Education Act</i>,
    and thus did not serve to relieve Nord-Est of its statutory obligation to
    pay for the public portion of the retirement gratuities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a three-day hearing, the trial judge made the following determinations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)         The agreement between Nord-Est and Near
    North was not an agreement pursuant to s. 135(26.1) since the reference to “boards
    concerned” in that subsection was intended to refer to a “sending” public
    school board  (such as Nord-Est) and  a “receiving” separate school board
    (such as Franco Nord), not two public school boards such as Nord-Est and
    Near North.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)         Nevertheless, there was a valid and
    enforceable agreement between Nord-Est and Near North to share liability
    for the public portion of retirement gratuities for employees now working
    with Franco Nord.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)         Therefore, in accordance with the terms
    of their agreement, Near North is liable for the retirement gratuities of
    the transferred teachers in the amount of 94.23%, and Nord-Est is liable
    in the amount of 5.77%.  Near North’s contractual obligation to pay 94.23%
    of the retirement gratuities extends to all future gratuities, <i>i.e.</i>,
    until the last teacher who transferred in 1986 has retired, and is not limited
    to the gratuities owing when the agreement was made.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons set out below, we conclude that the trial judge erred by deciding
    an issue that was not raised by the order directing the trial of an issue.  However,
    as all of the necessary evidence to determine whether there was such an agreement
    was before the trial judge, and as all the relevant legal arguments have
    now been made before us, it is appropriate for this court to decide whether
    there was legally binding agreement between the parties that would require
    Near North to reimburse Nord-Est for any amount owing to Franco-Nord on account
    of the retirement gratuities.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge decided that the answer to the first question was that the parties
    had not entered into an agreement within the meaning of section 135(26.1)
    of the <i>Education Act</i>.  No appeal is taken from that finding.  However,
    without giving the parties any notice or opportunity to make submissions
    on the point, she proceeded on her own initiative to decide that there was
    an agreement between Near North and Nord-Est, albeit not an agreement within
    the meaning of section 135(26.1), and granted the declaration of liability
    against Near North on the basis of the terms of that agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nord-Est
    submits that the judge simply reformulated the first question in two parts
    (was there an agreement and did that agreement fall within the reach of s.&nbsp;135(26.1))
    and answered each part of the question separately.  Nord-Est submits that
    all of the evidence as to the negotiation and terms of the agreement was
    before the trial judge and that no additional evidence was required for her
    to make her determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the question posed by the order directing the trial of an issue
    logically divides into these two parts and that all the evidence required
    to answer that two-part question was before the trial judge.  However, a
    third issue is also raised, namely, the legal issue of whether an agreement
    that does not fall within s. 135(26.1) is legally enforceable.  That issue
    was not addressed by the parties in argument before the trial judge or by
    the trial judge in her reasons.  By proceeding as she did, the trial judge
    effectively expanded the scope of the question that had been put to her and
    gave an answer that did not take into account Near North’s legal position,
    since advanced before us, that only agreements contemplated by s. 135(26.1)
    are legally binding.  By deciding that Near North was bound by an agreement
    that did not fall within s. 135(26.1), the trial judge went beyond the issue
    that had been presented to her by the order directing the trial of an issue
    and thereby erred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    more difficult question is what impact that error should have now that the
    order has been appealed and all issues arising between the parties have been
    fully argued before this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, Near North would suffer no prejudice if we were to decide all issues
    on the basis of the record now before this court.  In argument before us,
    Near North failed to identify any additional evidence that it would lead
    to supplement the existing record.  Near North submitted that had it known
    that it could be held liable on an agreement outside the contemplation of
    s. 135(26.1) it would have cross-claimed against the EIC and its members.  However,
    that strategy is precluded by s. 346 of the <i>Education Act</i>, which clothes
    the EIC and its members with immunity from liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only issue not addressed before the trial judge is the legal issue of whether
    in law there can be a binding agreement allocating liability for retirement
    gratuities other than an agreement specified in s. 135(26.1).  Near North
    concedes that it has now had full opportunity to argue that issue on this
    appeal.  In these circumstances, it is in the interests of justice for this
    court to deal with all issues raised on this appeal rather than remit the
    matter to the Superior Court and put the parties and the administration of
    justice to the expense of further litigation.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Near
    North submits that in the light of the detailed provisions in the <i>Education
    Act</i> relating to the allocation of assets and liabilities arising from
    the changed school board structure in 1998, any agreement falling outside
    s. 135(26.1) is precluded and unenforceable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept that submission.  We are not persuaded that such a preclusion
    can or should be implied from the language of s. 135 or any of its subsections.
     Subsection 135(26.1) appears to be intended to introduce an element of flexibility
    into the allocation of assets and liabilities, not rigidity.  It allows the
    school boards that are affected by the specific allocation of responsibility
    contained in s. 135(26) to “contract out” and make other suitable arrangements.  We
    see no reason to read a provision intended to introduce a measure of flexibility
    as between the boards that actually are directly affected by s.&nbsp;135(26)
    (Nord-Est and Franco Nord) as impliedly introducing an element of rigidity
    with respect to a board that is not directly affected by that provision (Near
    North). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
    there is nothing in the <i>Education Act</i> that expressly precludes agreements
    other than those specifically contemplated by the Act to be made between
    the changing array of school boards that have existed from 1986 to the present.  In
    our view, to imply such a restriction would introduce an unwarranted and
    undesirable degree of rigidity into a complex area of school administration
    that would impede the accommodation of varying local circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    conclude, accordingly, that the agreement whereby Near North undertook to
    bear its proportionate share of the cost of any retirement gratuity obligation
    assumed by the former Nipissing Board of Education is not precluded by the
    provisions of the <i>Education Act</i>.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Near
    North submits that the evidence shows that prior to entering their agreement,
    the parties failed to contemplate or take into account the impact of s. 135
    upon their respective positions.  Near North asserts that it operated under
    the belief that it was legally required to assume part of the liability for
    retirement gratuities payable to Franco Nord and that, but for this mistake,
    Near North would never have entered into the agreement.  Accordingly, Near
    North submits that the agreement should be set aside on the basis either
    that there was no <i>consensus ad idem</i> or that the agreement was vitiated
    by mutual mistake.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    arriving at a consensus regarding the transfer of liability for the retirement
    gratuities, both parties believed that they were doing so pursuant to s.

    only be granted where the claimant can establish that the other party was

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge carefully reviewed the course of the negotiations, the context
    in which they took place and the agreement that ensued.  There was no evidence
    of abuse of authority or oppression.  She concluded that any misunderstanding
    or misapprehension as to the effect of s. 135 on liability did not undermine
    or vitiate the agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    former Nipissing Board of Education had no reserve funds, and Near North
    and Nord-Est had to reach an agreement on a reasonable division of all assets
    and liabilities.  The trial judge aptly described the context of these negotiations
    at para. 85 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>The representatives who
    entered into the negotiation for the transfer of assets and liabilities on
    behalf of the new boards, Near North and Nord-Est, were educated, experienced
    administrators. Although laypersons and not lawyers, it is nonetheless evident
    that the parties to these negotiations had a sophisticated understanding
    of the functioning of school boards, and their legislative underpinnings.
    Moreover, all parties were aware that the negotiations were taking place
    in the context of significant change to the <i>Education Act</i>, the statute
    that governs the functioning of school boards and their employees. In this
    context, I would expect all parties to know the law and govern themselves
    accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge observed, retirement gratuities were only one of many items
    included in the transfer of assets and liabilities, some of which had higher
    values.  As she put it, at para. 84, “[t]he fact that one of the parties
    now takes the position that it should not have entered into such agreement,
    in light of s. 135(26), does not lead to the conclusion that the parties
    were not <i>ad idem</i> at the time the agreement was reached.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge also found, at para. 95, that even if the parties were ignorant
    of or misunderstood the effect of s. 135(26), their mistake as to responsibility
    for the payment of retirement gratuities was not so fundamental as to render
    the entire agreement for the transfer of all assets and liabilities void:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties were obliged to fairly divide the assets
    and liabilities of the former boards, including Nipissing, between them,
    and to ensure that both sides were economically able to function. The EIC
    also had an obligation to ensure that Near North's ability to exercise its
    powers, carry out its duties, and conduct its day to-day-operations would
    not be unduly impaired, and that Nord-Est would be able to discharge its
    administrative and operational responsibilities for the assets, liabilities,
    and employees that were being transferred to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    concluded, at para. 97:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the context of the entire transfer of assets
    and liabilities, the liability for the retirement gratuities, even at its
    highest estimated number, is not sufficiently significant to render the entire
    agreement void. In my view, there is no common fundamental misapprehension
    of the facts, going to the root of the agreement.</p>

    North states that its proposal for the distribution of assets and liabilities
    with Nord-Est was premised on the total amount of the liability for retirement
    gratuities being $252,231.  No other amount was identified or discussed.  Therefore,
    if the court is of the view that the agreement should be upheld, Near North’s
    liability should be limited to a maximum amount of 94.23% of $252,231, which
    is its proportionate share of the amount identified by the parties as the
    total obligation for retirement gratuities.  Near North also claims that
    even if the amount of $252,231 was an estimate, Near North never envisaged
    that the actual amount owing as of 2007 would be $825,760.93. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nord-Est
    takes the position that the joint demand and the order from the EIC are consistent
    with the unanimous evidence of the three people who negotiated the agreement
    and wrote the documents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that we should interfere with the trial judge’s findings
    which are factual in nature and supported by the record.  <span lang=EN-US>The
    figures upon which the estimate was based were drawn up by employees of a
    predecessor board, not by either Near North or Nord-Est.  Neither party took
    steps to verify the basis for the figure.  The actual amount of the liability
    cannot be known until the teachers concerned actually retire.  </span>The
    agreement that the parties made and that was approved by the EIC does not
    specify a limit and speaks instead of payment of a “proportionate share of
    costs<span lang=EN-US>”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we reject Near North’s submission that the trial judge erred by refusing
    to fix its liability by reference to the estimated amount. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent in the
    amount agreed to by the parties, $35,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
