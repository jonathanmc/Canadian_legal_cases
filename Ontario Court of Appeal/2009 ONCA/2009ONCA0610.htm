  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Tristan Bergauer-Free appeals from his conviction for possession
    of a loaded prohibited firearm under s. 95(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    At issue is the admissibility of a loaded handgun found in the trunk of his
    car. The appellant submits that the gun should have been excluded from evidence
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter </i>because it was obtained in a manner
    that violated his <i>Charter</i> rights under s. 9 (arbitrary detention),
    s. 8 (unreasonable search and seizure) and s. 10(b) (right to retain and
    instruct counsel) and its admission would, in the circumstances, bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    McIsaac of the Superior Court of Justice disagreed. Following a three-day <i>voir
    dire</i> in which he heard evidence from both the Crown and the defence,
    he found that the appellant, having been advised of his rights to counsel,
    freely consented to the search of his trunk and thereby waived his right
    to be free from unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    As such, even though the search may have been conducted at a time when the
    appellant was arbitrarily detained, the “search and seizure of the firearm
    and ammunition was not the product of any <u>Charter </u>breach”
    (emphasis in original).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
    McIsaac J. held that if he was “wrong in [his] conclusion” about the s. 8
    breach, he would nonetheless have admitted the gun under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.
    In his view, even though the admission of the gun might “have some minor
    impact on trial fairness”, the <i>Charter</i> breaches were not egregious,
    the evidence obtained was reliable, the police did not act in bad faith,
    the crime “involved a loaded firearm” and the impugned evidence was “crucial
    to the Crown’s case”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that McIsaac J. erred
    in concluding that the search of the appellant’s trunk was lawful and did
    not constitute a violation of his s. 8 rights. In view of that, McIsaac J.’s
    s. 24(2) conclusion is not entitled to the deference it would normally attract.
    And because I am unable to make the s. 24(2) determination on the existing
    record, I would allow the appeal, quash the appellant’s conviction and order
    a new trial. In consequence, I do not intend to detail the evidence called
    on the <i>voir dire</i>; rather, I propose to focus on those aspects which
    undermine the finding that the appellant consented to the search of his trunk
    and thereby waived his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to the evidence, I should explain the unusual procedural history
    of this matter.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Procedural History</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    search which led to the finding of the handgun in the appellant’s trunk occurred
    on May 10, 2006. It resulted in the laying of six gun and gun-related charges.
    On October 1, 2007, the appellant appeared before McIsaac J. in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, and pleaded “not guilty” to those charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 2, 2007, the appellant brought a pre-trial motion under s. 24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i> to exclude the handgun from evidence. On October 5,
    2007, after hearing two days of evidence and a third day of argument, McIsaac
    J. delivered the ruling that forms the basis of this appeal. The matter was
    then adjourned to be spoken to. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    October 5, 2007 and December 13, 2007, the parties forged an agreement whereby
    the appellant would be permitted to plead
    “not guilty” to one count of unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm,
    in return for which, the Crown could read the underlying facts into the record
    without opposition. That way, the appellant could preserve his appeal rights
    while avoiding the necessity of a full-blown trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    McIsaac J. normally presides in Barrie, Ontario, the parties further agreed
    that for convenience, the single count indictment could be placed before
    Bryant J. in Newmarket and he would preside over the uncontested trial proceeding.
    That proceeding occurred on December 13, 2007 (with McIsaac J.’s knowledge
    and approval), and Bryant&nbsp;J. found the appellant guilty on the single
    count indictment. On May 1, 2008, the original six-count indictment that
    had been before McIsaac J. was placed before Bryant&nbsp;J., and at the Crown’s
    request, Bryant J. permitted it to be withdrawn. On May 21, 2008, Bryant
    J. sentenced the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hence,
    although it was Bryant J. who ultimately convicted and sentenced the appellant
    for the offence under appeal, the appeal turns on the October 5, 2007 ruling
    of McIsaac J. (hereafter “the motion judge”). I now turn to that ruling.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Pertinent Evidence on the <i>Voir Dire</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 10, 2006 at about 1:30 a.m., in the Town of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Stouffville, Officer Basil Yousif stopped the appellant for proceeding through
    a red light. The appellant, then age 19, was accompanied by two of his friends.
    Upon request, the appellant produced his driver’s licence and registration.
    According to Officer Yousif, without being asked to do so, he also produced
    a military identity card. At the time, the appellant was a trooper with the
    Queen’s York Rangers of Aurora. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    being questioned, the appellant stated that he lived nearby in Unionville
    but had become lost and was driving around trying to meet up with a friend.
    The officer described the appellant as fidgety, nervous and flustered and
    he asked him to step out of the vehicle. Officer Yousif was suspicious of
    the appellant because of his demeanour and several inconsistencies in his
    responses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    outside the vehicle, the appellant started asking Officer Yousif questions
    about his service revolver. This was unique in the officer’s experience and
    it too served to heighten his suspicions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Yousif asked the appellant if he had any drugs in the vehicle and the appellant
    said he did not. The officer then asked if he could search the vehicle and
    the appellant replied “no problem”. Officer Yousif followed up by asking
    if he could search the appellant’s trunk. The appellant replied “do you have
    a warrant” and the officer responded “do I need a warrant?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Officer Yousif acknowledged that he wanted to see what
    was in the trunk because he was suspicious:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. … due to the suspicion … I knew there was something – due
    to all the facts accumulated that led me obviously to my suspicion, I knew
    there was something there, but I just – I was not able to pinpoint it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>Okay. So you … had a gut instinct
      something was in the vehicle but you just couldn’t pinpoint</i> … </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>That’s correct</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    some further conversation, the contents of which Officer Yousif could not
    recall, he went to his police car and retrieved a “Consent to Search” form,
    which he read to the appellant. The form, a copy of which is included at
    p. 12 of the appeal book, sets out the rights of the person whose consent
    is sought, including the right to retain and instruct counsel, the right
    to refuse to consent, and the right to have the search terminated at any
    time upon request. The form envisages responses from the consentor as the
    various rights are read. Spaces are provided for the officer and/or the consentor
    to write out the respective responses and at the end, there is a place for
    the consentor and witnesses to sign.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    way of illustration, the first line of the form reads as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You have been charged <span style='font-size:16.0pt;
'>&#8298; </span>or may be charged<span
style='font-size:16.0pt;'> &#8298; </span>with ______________________________. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The form then continues with the standard instructions on the
    right to counsel, followed by two questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'>Do you understand?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:
&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>REPLY: ________________________________</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Do you wish to call a lawyer now?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>REPLY: _________________________________</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the instant case, the form was not filled out or signed. Officer Yousif testified
    that after reading the form aloud to the appellant, it was his intention
    to “give [the appellant] the consent form so he can write, in his own words,
    in his handwriting … so I can keep the reliability, integrity and continuity
    of the search”.  That, however, proved unnecessary because according to Officer
    Yousif, “unfortunately
    … [the appellant] was cooperative, and said he knows his rights, and … opened
    the trunk”. Thereafter, to his regret, Officer Yousif neglected to have the
    appellant fill out the form. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inside
    the trunk, Officer Yousif observed a metal box with a combination lock. The
    appellant told him at first that the box contained personal belongings and
    then, after further questioning, stated that it contained a “dummy grenade” – later
    explained to be a paperweight-like object that could be purchased at any
    army surplus store. In order to ensure that the box did not contain a live
    explosive, Officer Yousif told the appellant to unlock the box.  The appellant
    complied. Inside the box, among other items, the officer located a loaded
    .22 calibre handgun – the prohibited weapon that forms the basis of the charge
    under appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the following exchange took place between Officer Yousif
    and defence counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now
    … I am going to suggest to you that [the appellant] asked you for the warrant
    [to search the trunk], you responded, do I need one and he said, yes, and
    your
    ….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I don’t remember if he said yes or
    no, sir.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. You just don’t remember one
    way or the other?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        That’s right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    further cross-examination, Officer Yousif acknowledged that after this exchange,
    he retrieved the “Consent to Search”
    form from his car and returned to the appellant. Defence counsel suggested
    to him that he did not read the form to the appellant, as he claimed, but
    that he handed the form to the appellant and told him to read it. Counsel
    further suggested that after a few moments, Officer Yousif took the form
    back and told the appellant to sign it. Officer Yousif denied both of those
    suggestions. That exchange, and the questions and answers flowing from it,
    are critical to the resolution of this appeal. Though lengthy, they bear
    repetition in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. And at that point you handed him
    the consent form, you told him to sign it, and he basically said, wait a
    sec. I have to read this – just let me finish.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Sure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        I have to read this, and after a few
    moments you basically took the consent away from him and said, okay, sign
    it?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Absolutely not, sir.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>And at that point you started taking
      issue with the fact that he wouldn’t sign the consent form, and you mentioned
      something to the effect of canine units</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I mentioned something?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>You mentioned canine units, that we
      could get a canine unit to come here</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>Yes, sir</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>Okay. So you did mention something
      about canine units </i>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>Yes, I did</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        … <i>coming here</i>? Okay. So – ‘cause
    that’s not in your notes?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No, it’s not, sir.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. <i>And can you just tell us, explain
      to us in what context the – the issue of canine units came up</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        It’s
    – <i>It’s because when he requested a warrant, and I said, do I need a warrant,
    and I said something to the effect of a canine unit and they’d be able to
    sniff out any drugs or weapons.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>Okay. ‘Cause if I suggest to you,
      at that point, the only way that sort of response by you makes sense is
      in this – if Mr. Bergauer-Free, sort of, said, yeah, I want you guys to
      get a warrant</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>I don’t recall what he said</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. And your, sort of, response is,
    look, you know, if you want – if you want to make this hard for yourself
    we could get a canine unit down here and he’ll sniff out whatever’s inside
    this vehicle, words to that effect?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Fortunately, for us with York Region
    Police, I can enlist the – the assistance of other units that can help me
    better investigate the situation or the incident. And canine was available,
    yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. <i>But – but at this point Mr. – again,
      Mr.&nbsp;Bergauer-Free’s not being investigated for a specific crime</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>No, he’s not</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>You have these suspicions that he’s
      not – he’s not being truthful what’s inside his vehicle</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>That’s correct, sir</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    – <i>and he asked for a warrant, or he suggests that, you know, you should
    get a warrant if you want to search the back, the trunk</i> …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>That’s right</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        …<i>right?</i> <i>And your response is
      your – I can get a canine unit down here</i>?</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified on the <i>voir dire</i> and took particular issue with
    Officer Yousif’s testimony concerning the “Consent to Search” form and the
    circumstances leading to the search of his trunk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, when Officer Yousif asked about searching the trunk, the
    appellant told him that he needed a warrant to do so. He agreed that Officer
    Yousif retrieved a “Consent to Search” form from his vehicle but denied that
    the officer read it aloud to him. Rather, he stated that he read it over
    several times and found some of the terminology confusing. He told the officer
    that he felt as though he was “pretty much giving [his] rights away” and
    did not know why he had to sign the form. The officer said
    “just sign, it makes things easier for both of us”. He also threatened to
    bring in the canine unit. When the appellant refused to sign, Officer Yousif
    took the form from him and said “listen … I can call canine, we can do this
    easy, or we can do this hard”. By this time, according to the appellant,
    four more police vehicles had arrived and he felt “blocked in” and “trapped
    in a corner”. In these circumstances, he capitulated by opening the trunk
    and the box containing the gun:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… I was trapped in. There were five police cars.
    There were several officers that were there. I’d been threatened with canine.
    He told me – he was, like, I can get canine here. He’d already made it quite
    clear that no matter what I did I wasn’t going to get out of there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the appellant reiterated that it was a combination of
    factors that caused him to capitulate. Admittedly, the presence of five police
    cars weighed heavily on him. However, he could not say for sure whether he
    would have succumbed to the pressure had there only been two police cars
    present. He did, however, reiterate that Officer Yousif had been “aggressive
    in tone” with him and made it clear that “he wouldn’t let me go”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of the number of police cars present when the appellant opened
    the trunk, other testimony, including that of one of the appellant’s passengers,
    confirmed Officer Yousif’s evidence that only his car and one other police
    car were present on scene when the appellant opened the trunk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge accepted Officer Yousif’s evidence on this point and took particular
    note of it in determining that the appellant freely consented to the search
    of his trunk. I now turn to the motion judge’s ruling.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Ruling</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, the motion judge provided alternative reasons for rejecting the
    appellant’s bid to have the handgun excluded from evidence. First and foremost
    was his determination that the search of the appellant’s trunk was lawful
    and that it did not constitute a breach of the appellant’s rights under s.
    8 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s conclusion on the s. 8 issue is found in the following paragraph
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assuming that the defendant was subjected to an
    arbitrary detention up to the point he consented to the search of his trunk,
    I am satisfied that he gave a full, free, and effective consent to that procedure
    …. The search and seizure of the firearm and ammunition was not the product
    of any <i>Charter</i> breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    that passage indicates, for purposes of the s. 8 analysis, the motion judge
    was prepared to “assume” that the appellant was being arbitrarily detained,
    contrary to s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>, “up to the point he consented to
    the search of his trunk”. That assumption accorded with the Crown’s position
    on the motion, although it did not go as far as the Crown was prepared to
    go. In its closing submissions on the motion to exclude the handgun, the
    Crown [not Ms. Cornaviera] conceded that the appellant was arbitrarily detained
    from the time Officer Yousif ordered him to step out of his car to the point
    when the appellant told the officer that there was a “dummy grenade” in the
    metal box.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    the Crown’s concession did not stop there. It included a further concession
    that the search of the appellant’s trunk was unlawful and constituted a violation
    of his rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, at least to the point where
    the appellant mentioned the “dummy grenade”. Although the Crown did not provide
    a reason for conceding the s. 8 breach, it seems obvious, as Ms. Cornaviera
    readily admitted in oral argument, that the Crown felt it could not show,
    on balance, that the appellant’s “consent to search” was voluntary and constituted
    a valid waiver. Hence, on the motion to exclude the gun, the Crown accepted
    that the gun had been obtained in a manner that violated the appellant’s
    rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the <i>Charter</i>; the issue of admissibility
    stood to be decided solely on the second branch of s. 24(2), that is, would
    the admission of the gun bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge, as was his right, refused to accept the Crown’s concession
    on the s. 8 breach.  In refusing to give effect to it, he instructed himself
    on the authorities governing the validity of a consensual search, including
    this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Wills</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 529 and
    found that the appellant was:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aware
    of the nature of the police conduct to which he was being asked to consent;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aware
    of his right to refuse to permit the police to search his trunk;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aware
    of his right to terminate the search once it had begun;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aware
    of the potential consequences of giving his consent; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aware
    of his right to contact counsel, including free and immediate advice from
    the Ontario Legal Aid ‘Hotline’.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    the motion judge based those findings –
    all of which were critical to his ultimate finding that the appellant freely
    consented to the search of his trunk – on his further finding that “all of
    that was brought home to the appellant <i>when he read</i> the Consent to
    Search form” (emphasis added). In so concluding, he appears to have accepted
    the appellant’s evidence – that the form was handed to him and he was asked
    to read it – over the evidence of Officer Yousif – that the officer read
    the contents of the form to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    made his findings on the appellant’s degree of awareness and knowledge of
    his rights, the motion judge turned to the appellant’s evidence and rejected
    the reasons given by him for “giving in” and consenting to the search of
    his trunk. In this regard, the motion judge found that there were only two
    police cars on scene when the trunk was opened, not five as the appellant
    claimed. Second, he found that if the appellant felt “trapped”, it had nothing
    to do with police coercion but “everything to do with his realization that
    he been caught virtually red-handed with an illegal handgun in his possession”.
    Third, he found that any fear the appellant might have had about the canine
    unit had nothing to do with his “being set upon by an Alsatian”; rather,
    it related to his concern that a dog would “ferret out [the prohibited handgun].” If
    Officer Yousif’s mention of the canine unit “created a sense of oppression”
    in the appellant, “it emanated from his own guilty mind and had nothing to
    do with the police pressure”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    followed, according to the motion judge, that because the impugned search
    was the product of the appellant’s fully informed consent, it was lawful
    and did not violate his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the assumption that he might be “wrong” in his s. 8 analysis, the motion
    judge turned to the issue of exclusion under s. 24(2). Given my view that
    he erred in his s. 8 analysis, the motion judge’s conclusion under s. 24(2)
    is not entitled to the deference it would normally attract: see <i>R. v.
    Grant</i>, 2009 SCC 32 at para. 129.  That being so, I do not intend to comment
    on it, especially since on my proposed disposition, it will be the sole issue
    for the presiding judge at the new trial and its outcome will largely depend
    on findings of fact that were either not made by the motion judge or if made,
    were the product of palpable and overriding errors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I propose to turn directly to the motion judge’s reasons for concluding that
    the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights were not breached and explain
    why, in my respectful view, he erred. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two reasons why the motion judge’s s. 8 analysis cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First
    and foremost, he erred in his approach to the issue. Had he brought the proper
    considerations to bear, in my view, he could not reasonably have concluded
    that the appellant freely consented to the search of his trunk and thereby
    waived his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    on the analysis he did bring to bear, I am satisfied that he made at least
    two and possibly three palpable and overriding factual errors that were material
    to the issue of consent and marred his conclusion. Those errors are straightforward
    and I propose to address them now.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Palpable and overriding factual errors</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first factual error concerns the appellant’s degree of awareness of his rights.
    In concluding that the appellant freely consented to the search of his trunk,
    the motion judge found that the appellant fully appreciated his rights and
    had all the information he needed to provide a valid waiver. According to
    the motion judge, “all of that was brought home to [the appellant] when he
    read the Consent to Search form”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the evidence does not support that conclusion. Officer Yousif claimed
    that he read the “Consent to Search” form to the appellant. The motion judge
    apparently rejected that aspect of his evidence, finding instead that the
    appellant learned of his rights from reading the form. That finding accorded
    with the appellant’s testimony – but only partially. The appellant testified
    that although he read and reread the form, he was “slightly confused by some
    of the terminology that was in there”. In cross-examination, he was not challenged
    on this; moreover, no attempt was made to clarify what parts of the form
    he understood and what parts he did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bearing
    that in mind, and taking into account the appellant’s age, the time of night,
    the less than ideal circumstances under which he was expected to read and
    understand the form and the fact that the form was not filled out or signed,
    I fail to see how the motion judge could find, as he did, that the appellant
    was fully apprised of his rights and had all of the information he required
    to provide a valid waiver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    need only consider the first line of the form to appreciate why the appellant
    may have felt confused:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You have been charged <span style='font-size:16.0pt;
'>&#8298; </span>or may be charged<span
style='font-size:16.0pt;'> &#8298; </span>with _____  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>  On his own evidence, Officer Yousif admitted that he had
    no reasonable basis for suspecting the appellant of any offence, apart from
    the traffic violation for which he had been stopped. In other words, the
    first line of the form had no application here – and there is nothing to
    indicate that Officer Yousif explained that to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of further illustration, while the form sets out the appellant’s rights
    to counsel, the record is silent as to any steps taken by Officer Yousif
    to ensure that the appellant truly understood his rights and chose to waive
    them. While Officer Yousif testified that the appellant told him that he “knew
    his rights”, he claimed that the appellant made that comment right after
    he had read the “Consent to Search” form to the appellant – a fact which
    the motion judge seems to have rejected. The only other evidence on the subject
    came from the appellant, who claimed that he found some of the terminology
    in the form confusing – hardly a basis for finding that he fully understood
    his rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second factual error relates to the motion judge’s rejection of the appellant’s
    evidence that he felt trapped and pressured into consenting to the search
    of his trunk. In so concluding, the motion judge found that to the extent
    he “may have felt trapped … this had nothing to do with improper police coercion
    and everything to do with his realization that he had been caught virtually
    red-handed with an illegal handgun in his possession”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, to find on these facts that the appellant knew he “had been caught
    virtually red-handed with an illegal handgun in his possession” is, if not
    untenable, at very least a gross overstatement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was stopped for a routine traffic violation; he had no reason to
    expect that this would lead to a search of his trunk – and he was right.
    Officer Yousif conceded that he had no cause to search the appellant’s trunk
    and no basis for obtaining a warrant to do so. He readily acknowledged that
    he was acting on a “gut instinct” and that he had no reasonable basis for
    suspecting, let alone believing, that the appellant had a gun or any other
    form of contraband in his possession.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    find in those circumstances that the appellant was caught “red-handed” because
    he knew he had an illegal handgun in his trunk is to turn the matter on its
    head. If anything, the circumstances support the appellant’s contention that
    he was not about to let the police search his trunk without a warrant and
    that he ultimately “gave up” because he felt he had no other choice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in rejecting the appellant’s evidence that he
    “gave up” because he felt pressured, the motion judge, having found that
    there were only two police cars on scene when the appellant opened the trunk,
    observed that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He [the appellant] conceded that he would not have
    been overborne if there were only two cruisers present which was the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the evidence relating to the appellant’s
    “concession” is somewhat murky and I am not satisfied, on balance, that he
    made it – at least not clearly, as the following interchange between the
    Crown and the appellant illustrates:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Do you agree with me or disagree with
    me, would you have opened the trunk if all five vehicles were not there?
    If it was just two vehicles, would – <i>if it was just Officer Yousif and
    Officer Corsi, you wouldn’t have opened the trunk, would you</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>I haven’t</i> …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        You
    – you’re …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        …
    been <i>in that situation. To be honest, I can’t answer that then</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless,
    even if it could be said that at some point in his testimony, the appellant
    made the concession attributed to him, a fair reading of his testimony as
    a whole shows that the pressure he felt came from a constellation of factors,
    not merely the presence of five police cruisers. For convenience, I repeat
    his answer to the final question in-chief set out above at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. In terms of, like, opening the
    trunk and opening the box, like, what was going through your mind at that
    point?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        That I was trapped in. There were five
    police cars. There were several officers that were there. I’d been threatened
    with canine. He told me – he was, like, I can get canine here. He’d already
    made it quite clear that no matter what I did I wasn’t going to get out of
    there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    response leads directly to the overriding error made by the motion judge
    in his approach to and analysis of the s. 8 issue. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Error in approach to and analysis of the
        s. 8 issue</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the motion judge failed to bring the proper considerations to bear
    in assessing whether the appellant’s “consent” was fully informed and meaningful.
    On this record, taking the Crown’s case at its highest, those preconditions
    could not, in my view, be satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s “consent” was not fully informed because Officer Yousif led him
    to believe that if he did not consent to the search of his trunk, he could
    be lawfully detained pending the arrival of the canine unit. That of course,
    was not accurate; on the contrary, it was misinformation. And that is the
    context against which Officer Yousif’s comment about bringing in the canine
    unit must be assessed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leaving
    aside the fact that in the circumstances, any
    “search” carried out by the canine unit would itself have been unconstitutional
    (see <i>R. v. Kang-Brown</i>, [2008] S.C.C.&nbsp;18), Officer Yousif had
    no lawful authority to hold the appellant for an additional moment beyond
    the time required to finalize the traffic ticket. Far from making that known
    to the appellant and giving him the choice to leave immediately, Officer
    Yousif led him to believe that he could be kept there pending the arrival
    of the canine unit. And he did so because he was not about to give up on
    his “gut instinct” that there was something in the trunk; rather, as he acknowledged,
    he was going to find out “one way or the other” what was in there. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How,
    in these circumstances, the appellant’s purported consent could be said to
    be “fully informed” escapes me. Telling the appellant that the canine unit
    could be called in carried with it the connotation that he could be lawfully
    kept there until it arrived. That was misinformation, hardly the stuff that
    makes for a finding of “fully informed” consent. Standing alone, that would
    be sufficient to vitiate the appellant’s purported consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts of this case, however, the misinformation had the further effect
    of eviscerating any meaningful choice the appellant had available to him.
    Translated, the message he received from Officer Yousif was: - you can refuse
    to consent but it will do you no good because I will bring in the canine
    unit regardless. That amounts to what the United States Supreme Court referred
    to in <i>Bumper v. North Carolina</i>, 391 U.S. 543 (1968), as “colorably
    lawful coercion”.  And, as Stewart J. for the majority observed at p.&nbsp;550: “Where
    there is coercion, there cannot be consent”. I agree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Yousif had no authority to hold the appellant while he brought in the canine
    unit.  His erroneous representation to the contrary rendered the appellant’s
    right to withhold his consent illusory and effectively left him with no choice
    at all. In my view, that too vitiated his purported consent. </p>

    follows that on this record, taking the case for the Crown at its highest,
    had the motion judge brought the proper considerations to bear, he could
    not reasonably have concluded that the appellant fully consented to the search
    of his trunk and thereby waived his s. 8 rights. Accordingly, that finding
    cannot stand. Rather, the search of the appellant’s trunk amounted to a violation
    of his rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Remedy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, in view of my conclusion that the search of the appellant’s trunk
    was unlawful and constituted a violation of his s. 8 rights, the motion judge’s
    alternate determination that the handgun was admissible under s. 24(2) is
    not entitled to deference. While counsel for the appellant invited us to
    redo the s. 24(2) analysis and make our own determination, in my view, this
    is not an appropriate case to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    that the handgun was obtained in a manner that breached the appellant’s rights
    under s. 8 and s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>, it is open to question whether
    the appellant was made aware of his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> before
    he opened the trunk. Without wishing to prejudge the outcome of the s. 24(2)
    motion at the new trial, that could be a significant factor in assessing
    the <i>bone fides</i> of Officer Yousif’s conduct and the overall seriousness
    of the s. 8 and s. 9 breaches and their impact on the appellant’s Charter-protected
    interests. Also, although Officer Yousif had no legal right in the circumstances
    to bring in the canine unit, the law on that subject was not entirely clear
    at the time of the incident and Officer Yousif’s understanding of it is not
    spelled out in the record. I am not in a position to make those and other
    assessments that will no doubt figure in the s. 24(2) analysis having regard
    to the Supreme Court’s recent decision in <i>R. v. Grant,</i> <i>supra.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial.</p>
