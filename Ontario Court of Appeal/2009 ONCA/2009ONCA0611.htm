  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the judgment of McIsaac J. dismissing much of its
    claim against the respondent King’s Bay Development Corp. and its entire
    claim against Tarion Warranty Corporation and The Registrar of Tarion Warranty
    Corporation (Tarion).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s decision respecting King’s Bay turned on his interpretation
    of an earlier order of Lack J. granting certain relief to King’s Bay.  In
    my view, because the trial judge misapprehended the effect of Lack J.’s order,
    he failed to make crucial findings of fact.  In the result, the appeal as
    against King’s Bay must be allowed and a new trial ordered.  I would, however,
    dismiss the appeal against Tarion.  The trial judge made a finding of fact
    respecting the appellant’s attempt to renew its Ontario New Home Warranty
    Program registration that is fatal to the appellant’s claim against Tarion.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is a home builder.  King’s Bay is a developer that owned a parcel
    of land in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Township of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Mariposa.  In April 2000, the appellant and King’s Bay entered into a purchase
    and sale agreement respecting 106 lots on an approved plan of subdivision.  The
    essence of the agreement was that King’s Bay would complete all of the services
    to make lots ready for building new homes.  The appellant would then build
    the new homes.  Once a home was sold, King’s Bay would be paid the price
    of the lot as set out in the agreement and the appellant would be paid the
    balance as the purchase price of the home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreement was for a one-year term but could be renewed and it continued until
    January 21, 2003, when King’s Bay purported to terminate the agreement because
    of alleged breaches by the appellant.  The appellant denied that it had breached
    the agreement and in turn alleged breaches by King’s Bay.  There was an exchange
    of correspondence, including a letter of February 7, 2003.  In that letter
    King’s Bay barred the appellant from the site because the appellant’s registration
    with Tarion had lapsed and purported to exercise clause “c” of the Remedies
    in Schedule “F” to the agreement. That clause required the appellant to give
    up possession and entitled King’s Bay to retain the land for its own use “together
    with all improvements thereon completed by the [appellant]”.  The immediate
    effect of this letter was to prevent the appellant from completing homes
    on three lots (12, 44 and 82) that were in various stages of completion.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ORDER OF LACK. J.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>King’s
    Bay applied under Rule 14.05 for declarations (a) that the appellant was
    in breach of the agreement, (b) that King’s Bay was entitled to exercise
    its remedies under the agreement as specified in Schedule
    “F” of the agreement, and (c) that the appellant had no interest in any of
    the lots.  Lack J. heard the application on August 5, 2003.  She found that
    there were no material facts in dispute establishing two breaches of the
    agreement.  First, that the appellant was not registered under the Ontario
    New Home Warrant Plan.  Second, it had failed on more than two occasions
    within a 12 month period to complete new house construction within 5 days
    of the date specified for closing sales to the new home buyers.  This latter
    breach related to lots 12, 44 and 82.  Accordingly, Lack J. granted the application
    for the declaration that the appellant was in breach of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    Lack J. refused that part of the application seeking declarations that King’s
    Bay was entitled to exercise its remedies under Schedule “F” and that the
    appellant had no interest in any of the lots.  She held that the appellant
    had raised issues as to King’s Bay’s default under the agreement and outstanding
    monies owed by King’s Bay to the appellant.  She therefore ordered a trial
    of the following issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was
    King’s Bay in default under the agreement?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    monies, if any, were owing by King’s Bay to the appellant?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    either or both cases, what remedy was the appellant entitled to?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    remedies was King’s Bay entitled to by virtue of the appellant's established
    breaches?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lack
    J. also held that King’s Bay could complete the construction of the homes
    on lots 12, 44 and 82 in accordance with paragraph (b) of the Remedies of
    Default of Schedule “F”.  Paragraph (b) provided that if new house construction
    had been commenced upon lots that were the subject of a default, King’s Bay
    could retain other contractors to complete construction and then complete
    sale of the lot to the new home buyers.  Lack J. held that final disposition
    of the net proceeds of the sales may be taken into account on the trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>KING’S BAY’S CLAIM</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>King’s
    Bay alleged that it had suffered various types of damages by reason of the
    appellant’s defaults under the agreement.  For example, King’s Bay claimed
    that the appellant had failed to remit deposits that had been paid by new
    home buyers that King’s Bay had to refund.  It also claimed that the appellant
    had impaired its ability to sell lots on the property so that it incurred
    additional interest charges.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPELLANT’S CLAIM</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant denied that it had caused the damages alleged by King’s Bay and
    counterclaimed against King’s Bay.  The appellant claimed that it had incurred
    substantial expenses because it was forced to carry out work on various lots
    that under the agreement were to have been performed by King’s Bay.  It also
    claimed that it was entitled to the value of the work that it had performed
    on lots 12, 44 and 82.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also claimed that King’s Bay had breached Lack J.’s order.  Instead
    of retaining another company to complete the construction of the houses on
    lots 12, 44 and 82, and selling the completed homes to new house buyers,
    King’s Bay did nothing for over a year and then sold the lots to another
    company at “fire-sale”
    prices.  The appellant claimed that as a result, it lost its share of the
    profit that it would have been entitled to from the sale of the houses.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial in this matter lasted 11 days including testimony in October 2006 and
    closing submissions in August 2007.  The parties filed written submissions.  The
    appellant in particular filed a 41-page written argument and 11-page reply
    argument.  The trial judge released his four page reasons in January 2008.  He
    dealt with King’s Bay’s claim in one short paragraph and the appellant’s
    claim in two short paragraphs.  He made no findings of fact with respect
    to those claims stating that the claims and the amounts were either uncontested
    or determined by the earlier order of Lack J.  I will set out his reasons
    below.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>King’s Bay’s Damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons respecting King’s Bay’s damages were as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>King’s Bay seeks damages totalling $573,981.08
    from the defendant made up of three heads: additional interest charges in
    the amount of $573,981.08<span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[sic]</span>, $40,000 paid to the purchasers
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 44 as a refund of their deposit and a payment of $4,976.85 to a third
    party for a plumbing installation at the same location. Cornerstone has not
    contested any of these claims which are, in my opinion, well documented and
    established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two problems with these reasons.  First, it is not correct that the appellant
    did not contest any of the claims.  The appellant both in cross-examination
    of King’s Bay’s main witness and in its submissions at the conclusion of
    the trial contested its liability for the largest part of the claim, the
    additional interest charges.  The basis for the additional interest charges
    appeared to be that, because of the appellant’s breaches of the agreement,
    King’s Bay had been unable to sell any additional lots.  The appellant denied
    that its actions had impaired King’s Bay’s ability to sell the additional
    lots or that King’s Bay had lost any sales as a result of its actions.  Some
    of the evidence given by King’s Bay’s main witness in cross-examination appeared
    to lend substantial credence to the appellant’s position.  The trial judge
    simply did not deal with this evidence, nor the issue it raises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other problem with the reasons is that the trial judge failed to identify
    the legal theory that would entitle King’s Bay to the additional interest
    charges or make the findings of fact necessary to sustain it.  For example,
    the trial judge did not identify anything in the agreement that would make
    the appellant liable for these charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the award of damages against the appellant cannot stand.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Appellant’s Claim Against King’s Bay</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons respecting the appellant’s claim against King’s Bay
    are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant claims that King’s Bay owes it $731,000
    for various alleged defaults under the contract. I am unable to accept the
    first part of that claim in the amount of $309,000 because it is based on
    a premise which would be contrary to the ruling of Lack, J. The defendant
    also claims $442,000 for certain payments made on behalf of King’s Bay along
    with costs associated with a delay in obtaining necessary approvals to permit
    this development to move forward. The plaintiff does not really contest this
    part of the claim which, in my opinion, has been properly documented and
    proved.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The result of these two claims means that the plaintiff
    is entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $131,981.08.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first problem with these reasons is the assertion that the appellant’s claim
    for $309,000 was based on a premise that was contrary to the order of Lack
    J.  As I understand it, the trial judge’s reference to $309,000 relates to
    the appellant’s claim for reimbursement for the work it had performed on
    the three lots and interest on the money.  The trial judge gave no reasons
    for this holding and so the basis for the holding is obscure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lack
    J. had held only that King’s Bay had shown that the appellant breached the
    agreement.  She expressly left open the question of what remedies King’s
    Bay was entitled to by reason of the two established breaches and what remedies
    the appellant might be entitled to.  The fact that the appellant had breached
    the agreement in two respects did not determine King’s Bay’s entitlement
    to remedies nor necessarily disentitle the appellant to a remedy.  It may
    be that King’s Bay was entitled to the remedy in paragraph “c” of the Remedies
    of Default of Schedule “F”, in which case it would not be liable to account
    to the appellant for the improvements.  However, that was a contested matter
    at trial.  Because of the trial judge’s misapprehension of the effect of
    Lack J.’s orders he failed to make the necessary findings of fact.  He also
    failed to identify the legal theory that disentitled the appellant to the
    remedies it sought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the order of Lack J. suggested that King’s Bay was to complete the homes
    on the three lots with the net proceeds of the sales to be taken into account
    on the trial.  The trial judge failed to deal with the appellant’s submission
    that King’s Bay had breached Lack J.’s order and thus wrongfully deprived
    the appellant of the amounts it had expended to improve the lots and of its
    share of the profit on the sales to new house buyers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was also in error in holding that the $442,000 claim by the appellant
    was not contested by King’s Bay.  There was a serious dispute about the amounts
    claimed by the appellant, a fact confirmed by counsel for the appellant in
    his oral submissions before us.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Remedy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purpose of Lack J.’s order directing a trial of the four issues she identified
    was because material facts were in dispute and there was a serious contest
    as to the legal basis for the claims made by both the appellant and King’s
    Bay.  King’s Bay submits that the trial judge’s reasons are sufficient and
    that the record supports his findings.  It relies upon the decision of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. M. (R.E.)</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, where
    the court pointed out that a trial judge’s reasons are sufficient if they
    show why the judge arrived at the decision; it is not necessary for the reasons
    to demonstrate how the judge reached the decision.  But, as McLachlin C.J.C.
    said in <i>R. v. M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 20, “the trial judge need not expound
    on evidence which is uncontroversial, or detail his or her findings on each
    piece of evidence or controverted fact, <i>so long as the findings linking
    the evidence to the verdict can be logically discerned</i>” [emphasis added].  That
    was not done in this case.  The reasons in this case contain bare conclusions
    tainted by a misapprehension of the parties’ positions and a misunderstanding
    of the impact of Lack J.’s order.  To the extent the reasons show why the
    trial judge arrived at his conclusions, the reasons are erroneous.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the trial judge made no findings of fact and failed to identify the legal
    basis for any of the orders he made in relation to the dispute between King’s
    Bay and the appellant, there must be a new trial.  Because the damage claims
    by both parties are so interrelated, the new trial must be in relation to
    all of the claims by both parties, even though there was no cross-appeal
    by King’s Bay.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Claim Against Tarion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tarion
    Warranty Corporation is the regulating body of the new home building industry
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario and administers the <i>Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. O.31.  All vendors and builders of new homes must register
    with Tarion.  The registration must be renewed annually, and the renewal
    application must be accompanied by up to date financial statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s registration under the Act was to expire on November 27, 2002.  The
    previous year, Tarion had waived the financial statement requirement but
    imposed a requirement that the appellant provide $5,000 security for each
    home enrolled.  The appellant was also told that financial statements would
    have to be submitted with the next renewal application.  It was made clear
    at the time that the 2001 waiver was a one-time favour to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not submit its renewal application in November 2002 since it
    did not have up-to-date financial statements.  Nothing further occurred respecting
    the renewal until January 6, 2003, when the appellant attempted to enrol
    a home so that it could close the sale.  The appellant’s principal, Vic Walker,
    attended at Tarion’s head office and was told that the registration had expired,
    but that Tarion would reactivate the registration if the completed renewal
    application, including the financial statements, was provided by January
    15, 2003.  The appellant did not submit its renewal application by January
    15.  On January 20, Mr. Walker reattended at Tarion’s office with the application,
    including the financial statements, but Tarion refused to accept the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 20, 2003, Tarion accepted an enrolment fee for the home that the
    appellant had attempted to register on January 6, 2003 and took $5,000 security.  As
    a result, the sale of that home could be completed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that Tarion was negligent in refusing to accept its renewal
    application either on November 27, 2002 or January 15, 2003 and it suffered
    damages as a result.  For example, since its registration expired, the appellant
    was deemed to be in breach of its agreement with King’s Bay and <i>inter
    alia</i> was prevented from completing the homes on lots 12, 44 and 82.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt with this claim on the basis that the appellant’s loss
    of registration “was due to its wilful and persistent failure to file necessary
    financial documentation”.  He also held that “no liability arose from [Tarion’s]
    gratuitous offer to reinstate the registration following its lapse nor from
    Tarion’s agreement to permit a ‘one-off’ registration”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that it wilfully
    failed to file the financial statements.  It submits that the evidence shows
    that the failure to file the financial statements was not wilful but the
    result of circumstances beyond its control.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that, in any event, a renewal application is sufficient
    if the applicant has submitted the renewal form and the renewal fee; there
    is no requirement that financial statements be provided.  It relies upon
    s. 9(8) of the Act, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where, within the time prescribed therefore or,
    if no time is prescribed, before expiry of the registration, a registrant
    has applied for renewal of a registration and paid the prescribed fee, the
    registration shall be deemed to continue,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) until the renewal is granted; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) where the registrant is served with notice
    that the Registrar proposes to refuse to grant the renewal, until the time
    for giving notice requiring a hearing has expired and, where a hearing is
    required, until the Tribunal has made its order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that it should have been allowed to file the form along
    with the fee, which would have automatically continued its registration.  If,
    because of the absence of the financial statements, the Registrar was of
    the view that the registration should not be renewed, the Registrar should
    have made a proposal under s. 9(8)(b).  This would have given the appellant
    access to a hearing before the Licence Appeal Tribunal.  But, in the meantime
    its registration would have continued.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there was evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that the
    failure to file the financial statements was wilful.  Mr. Walker never disclosed
    to Tarion the reason that the statements were not available.  He withheld
    that the appellant was subject to a G.S.T. audit and faced a substantial
    potential penalty of over $200,000.  The appellant was granted an indulgence
    by Tarion when it extended the renewal date to January 15, 2003, but it was
    told that this was an absolute deadline.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    I do not accept the appellant’s submission that an applicant for renewal
    need only submit the form and the fee.  Section 10(3) of the Regulations
    to the Act, Regulation 892, R.R.O. 1990 provides that the applicant for a
    renewal of registration “shall complete, execute and deliver to the Registrar
    such form or forms of application <i>and such other documentation as the
    Registrar may provide from time to time</i>” (emphasis added).  The renewal
    form provided by the Registrar requires the applicant to provide current
    financial statements or interim statements.  Thus, a renewal application
    is not complete unless the documents required by the Registrar have been
    provided.  Since the appellant did not provide the application, including
    the financial statements, on November 27 or on the extended date of January
    15, its registration expired.  It was no longer open to the appellant to
    renew its application; it had to reapply for registration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the events of February 10, 2003, I agree with Tarion’s submission that
    this did not result in a deemed renewal of the registration.  The circumstances
    surrounding this event are set out in Tarion’s factum as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On February 10, 2003, Cornerstone contacted Tarion
    because it wished to close a home that day with certain purchasers, the Prankards.
    By this date, the Prankards had already sold their prior home and were living
    at their parents’ home or out of their car and expecting to close the transaction
    for their new home. It was the middle of winter. Tarion was aware of the
    difficult position the homeowners were in, through no fault of their own – Cornerstone
    was not registered and therefore, it was contrary to the Act for it to complete
    the transaction with the purchasers. On the other hand, the purchasers would
    be homeless if Tarion did not provide Cornerstone with the Certificate of
    Completion and Possession (“C.C.P.”) so that Cornerstone could close the
    transaction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In order to protect the consumers, the Prankards,
    Tarion ultimately released the C.C.P. to Cornerstone so that it could close
    the home. On that date, February 10, 2003, Cornerstone tried, once again,
    to provide Tarion with a completed renewal package, including the financial
    statements. Again, as on January 20, 2003, Tarion refused to accept the package
    because the deadline for re-instatement (January 15<sup>th</sup>) had passed.
    Tarion again told Cornerstone that it needed to reapply as a new registrant
    if it wished to be registered under the Act. Cornerstone chose not to reapply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact remained that Tarion’s registration had expired.  The Registrar’s actions,
    taken to protect the consumer, could not retroactively revive the registration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the claim against Tarion was properly dismissed.  Given this conclusion I
    need not deal with Tarion’s alternative submission that it owed no duty of
    care to the appellant and thus could not be held liable in negligence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appellant’s appeal against King’s Bay and order a new trial
    of the issues identified by Lack J. in her order of August 19, 2003.  The
    appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal which I would fix at $6,000
    inclusive of GST and disbursements, payable by King’s Bay.  I would order
    that the costs of the trial before McIsaac J. be at the discretion of the
    judge hearing the new trial.  I would dismiss the appeal against Tarion with
    costs payable by the appellant fixed at $5,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
