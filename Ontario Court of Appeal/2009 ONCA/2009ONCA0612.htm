    of these events, the appellant was on probation for an assault charge relating
    to a guilty verdict entered on April 22, 1999.  One of the probation conditions

      to live in the community in accommodation approved by the person in charge.  The <i>amicus

      unreasonable in that it erred in law in failing to consider meaningfully

      agree with the submissions of the <i>amicus curiae</i> and would allow

      correctly identifies the applicable law, it failed in my view, </span>to
      explain why the disposition it ordered is the least onerous and least restrictive
      to Mr. Lamanna.</p>
  <h2>1.         The standard of review</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    672.78 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>provides that this court may set aside
    an order of a Review Board only where it is of the opinion that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)       it is unreasonable or cannot be supported
    by the evidence; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)       it is based on a wrong decision on a question
    of law; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)       there was a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    standard of review for the first branch of s. 672.78 is reasonableness, while
    the second branch is concerned with a question of law, and thus the standard
    is correctness.  Here the standard of reasonableness is engaged, which <i>Dunsmuir</i> <i><span lang=EN-GB>v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, </span>at para. 47, describes as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires
    into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the
    process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes.&nbsp; In judicial review,
    reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency
    and intelligibility within the decision-making process.&nbsp; But it is also
    concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable
    outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a review of the record, I am not able to conclude that the disposition of
    the majority of the Review Board was reasonable.  As I have said, the majority
    has failed to explain why its decision to detain Mr. Lamanna, in all the
    circumstances, is the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused.  In
    other words, I am unable to conclude that its decision, in respect of the
    facts and law applicable to this case, falls within the range of possible,
    acceptable outcomes.</p>
  <h2>2.         The Review Board’s legal test</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman";'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming
    that the majority of the Review Board was correct in deciding that Mr. Lamanna
    posed a “significant threat to the safety of the public”, it was next required
    to order him discharged or detained <span lang=EN-US>in custody in a hospital,
    subject to such conditions as the court or the Review Board considers appropriate:  ss.
    672.54 (b) and (c) of the <i>Code</i></span>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman";'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      arriving at its disposition for Mr. Lamanna, the Review Board was required
      under s.&nbsp;672.54 of the <i>Code </i>to consider: (i) the need to protect
      the public from dangerous persons; (ii) Mr. Lamanna’s mental condition;
      (iii) the reintegration of Mr. Lamanna into society; and (iv) Mr. Lamanna’s “other
      needs”.&nbsp;  While taking these factors into account, the Review Board
      was required to make a disposition that was the
    “least onerous and least restrictive” to Mr. Lamanna:  see also <i>Mazzei
    v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services)</i>, [2006]
    1 S.C.R. 326, at para. 19.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman";'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The
    “least onerous and least restrictive” requirement is not free-standing and
    cannot be viewed in isolation from the other factors enumerated in s. 672.54.&nbsp; A
    review board is required to consider “at every step<i> </i>of s.&nbsp;672.54”
    the factors outlined in that section, without segregating the “least onerous
    and least restrictive” requirement for different or separate consideration:  <i>Penetanguishene
    Mental Health Centre v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (Attorney General)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 498 (“<i>Tulikorpi</i>”),
    at para. 45.  At para. 3 of <i>Tulikorpi</i>, Binnie J. described the requirement
    this way:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he <i>Criminal Code</i> entitles the [NCR accused]
    to conditions that, viewed in their entirety, are the least onerous and least
    restrictive of his liberty consistent with public safety, his mental condition
    and “other needs” and his eventual reintegration into society.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
      under s.&nbsp;672.54, the test for arriving at a disposition order requires
      that the disposition, including the conditions that apply to it, be evaluated
      as a whole in accordance with all the requirements of s.&nbsp;672.54: see <i>Tulikorpi</i>,
      at paras. 45 and 67.  Moreover, at every step of this evaluation process,
      consideration must be given to the liberty interests of the NCR accused: <i>Tulikorpi</i>,
      at paras. 53-56.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <h2>3.         The Review Board’s application of the test</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority of the Review Board, after a consideration of the evidence presented
    at the hearing, accepted the hospital’s recommendation that there be no change
    to the current disposition order Mr. Lamanna was under.  This means that
    Mr. Lamanna was ordered detained at the minimum secure unit of the Whitby
    Mental Health Centre.  Also, he is to have hospital and community privileges
    including permission to live in the community in accommodation approved by
    the person in charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching its decision, the majority of the Review Board, at paragraph 23,
    found that “Mr. Lamanna does continue to represent a significant threat to
    safety (sic) of the public”.  Regarding the least onerous and least restrictive
    disposition, the majority first observed that:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>Within the last year, Mr.
    Lamanna was discharged to the community to reside in a supervised group home.  That
    discharge was quite short lived.  Upon Mr. Lamanna’s readmission to hospital
    he was quite agitated when interviewed by Dr. Chapman.  Mr. Lamanna’s behaviour
    at the time of that interview was such that a code white was called.  Also
    Dr. Chapman said Mr. Lamanna was clearly suffering from positive symptoms
    of persecutory and grandiose delusions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority’s reasons then go on to conclude, essentially in the words of s.
    672.54 of the <i>Code</i>, that a detention order was required: (i) because
    Mr. Lamanna posed a threat to the safety of the public; (ii) because he has
    a mental condition that needs to be addressed; and (iii) for his reintegration
    into society and “his other needs”.  They found that the detention order
    was required:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>…
    such that if he is moved back to community living within the next year and
      once again required readmission to hospital, the hospital can react and
      readmit Mr. Lamanna quickly.  It is important that they can do so in a
      timely manner such that he does not decompensate to the point where he
      becomes aggressive or violent putting the public at risk.  Also it is in
      his best interest in that as Dr. Chapman pointed out the earlier the hospital
      can intervene the shorter any readmission is likely to be.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear to me from the reasons that the disposition of the majority of the
    Review Board is grounded almost exclusively in its concern for Mr. Lamanna’s
    possible decompensation — referring to the progressive worsening of a patient’s
    mental disorder.  Its reasons are directed at the remedies available and
    the speed with which authorities can respond if Mr. Lamanna were to decompensate.  Although
    the majority articulates the correct test in its reasons, it fails to explain
    why the disposition it ordered is the least onerous and least restrictive
    to Mr. Lamanna.  I reach this conclusion for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the Review Board’s majority reasons do not address Mr. Lamanna’s willingness
    to agree to a condition specifying that he take medication under a discharge.   It
    provides no reasons by which this court can assess whether the Board’s disposition
    is defensible in respect of the facts and law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Recent
    amendments to the <i>Criminal Code </i>permit the Board to specify a place
    of return in the event of a discharge.  Section 672.91 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> allows for the arrest of a conditionally discharged NCR accused
    for the anticipated breach of a condition, and s. 672.93(2) allows the Board
    to specify the place where the accused is to be returned.  The failure to
    take medication as ordered would be a breach of one of the Review Board’s
    conditions and would justify a return to the hospital, even if there was
    no decompensation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>Second,
      although the majority of the Review Board acknowledged, at para. 22, the <i>Mental
      Health Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7, as amended, as a means for bringing
      a person into hospital, it did not address the adequacy of the relevant
      provisions, namely ss. </span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>15(1), (1.1)
      and (5), in this context</span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>.  For
      example, s<span style='color:black'>hould Mr. Lamanna decompensate, the
      provincial <i>Mental Health Act</i> could arguably be used to return him
      to custody if the requirements pursuant to s. 672.91 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> for a warrantless arrest, including a breach of conditions or
      an anticipated breach of conditions, were not met.</span></span></p>
