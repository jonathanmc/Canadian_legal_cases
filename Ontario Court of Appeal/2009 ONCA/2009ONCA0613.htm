  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 10, 2005, the complainant, E.L., called the police for advice about
    whether the appellant, her husband, was entitled to take their child to see
    his parents without her presence or consent.  From that call, and the meeting
    with police following it, flowed a series of events leading to the appellants
    conviction on three charges of assault, two charges of uttering threats,
    and one charge of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks to set aside those convictions.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    concedes that there was sufficient evidence before the trial judge  if properly
    considered and accepted  upon which a conviction could be based.  He concedes
    that the trial judge was entitled to assess and to resoundingly reject his
    evidence, as she did.  He argues, however, that his convictions turned almost
    entirely on the trial judges determination of the credibility of the complainant
    and the appellant.  The appellant therefore submits that, having rejected
    his testimony  and having been unsparing [in her] criticism of him  the
    trial judge was obliged to scrutinize the complainants testimony with equal
    rigour and in a balanced fashion.  This she failed to do, he says.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that instead, the trial judge applied a different standard
    of scrutiny in her assessment of the evidence of the complainant as compared
    to her assessment of the evidence of the appellant.  She glossed over inconsistencies
    in the complainants evidence without subjecting them to careful analysis
    and without making findings that were necessary in order to explain them.  In
    addition, she misapprehended or mischaracterized both the appellants and
    the complainants testimony in several respects. As a result of the cumulative
    effect of these various errors, the appellant contends that we must quash
    the convictions and enter acquittals or, in the alternative, order a new
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the particular circumstances of this case, and for the reasons that follow,
    I would set aside the convictions and order a new trial.</p>
  <h3>BACKGROUND AND FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant emigrated from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:country-region>
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    with his parents when he was a young boy.  In March 2002, while he and his
    parents were vacationing in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Cyprus</st1:country-region>
    , he and the complainant were introduced to each other.  They were each 29
    years old at the time and began dating.  A short time later they became engaged.  When
    the appellant returned to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in June 2002, the complainant came with him.  They were married a few weeks
    later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    first the couple lived with the appellants parents in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kitchener.  There was friction between the complainant and the appellants
    parents, however, and in January 2003, the appellant and the complainant
    moved into their own apartment in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Kitchener.  In July 2004, they purchased and moved into a house in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Woodstock.  This pleased the complainant because she felt that the parents
    were interfering too much in their lives.  They were living in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Woodstock house when the events leading up to the charges took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    daughter of the appellant and the complainant, S., was born in November 2003.  There
    is no dispute that she was conceived on February 28, 2003, the date on which
    the complainant says she was sexually assaulted by the appellant.  S.s care
    by the appellants parents became a source of contention between them, particularly
    after the child and the appellant returned from his parents home on one
    occasion in Fall 2004, and the complainant noticed that the childs genital
    area was very red and swollen.  This led to an incident that provides the
    basis for one of the charges of assault and threatening, to which I will
    return.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 10, 2005, matters came to a head.  There was a discussion about
    whether the complainant would allow the appellant to take the child to his
    parents house without the complainant being present.  She refused.  He insisted.  There
    was also tension between the two of them around the signing of mortgage documents
    to support a financing that had been arranged by the appellant to enable
    them to repay family loans advanced to enable them to purchase their home.  The
    complainant maintained that at least part of these funds were to have been
    a gift.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant decided to call the police for advice about whether the appellant
    was entitled to take the child to his parents alone.  When the police attended
    at the couples home in response to the call, the complainant told them  in
    response to a direct question from one of the officers (P.C. Kuivenhoven)
    about whether there had been any violence between her and the appellant that
    day or in the past  that a few months earlier, when engaged in an argument
    over the child, the appellant had pushed her, held her by the neck and stated, Im
    going to kill you.  The appellant was arrested shortly thereafter and taken
    to the police station.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    series of other revelations followed sometime later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant says she was shocked when the police took her husband away but
    that she did not know  or ask whether  the appellant was being charged
    with anything.  She also testified that P.C. Kuivenhoven told her the appellant
    would be back home in six weeks.  P.C. Kuivenhoven denied that he made any
    such statement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    that same day, the complainant attended at the police station where she gave
    a sworn videotaped statement to P.C. Kuivenhoven.  During that statement
    she mentioned three or four other incidents in addition to the one described
    above, but provided no details or dates with respect to those incidents.  There
    is controversy in the evidence as to whether the complainant told P.C. Kuivenhoven
    during the interview that she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant.  She
    says she did and that she told the police officer that he raped me.  He
    says that she did not report a sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 10, 2005, single charges of assault and uttering threats were laid
    against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following day the complainant moved to a womens shelter with S., at the
    suggestion of the police.  She was provided with some information about domestic
    abuse and a checklist upon her arrival.  She completed the checklist and
    testified that it was through the counselling and information she received
    at the shelter that she realized she had been living in an abusive relationship
    and that what had occurred when S. was conceived was sexual assault (she
    previously believed that a husband could not sexually assault his wife).  She
    retained the checklist in her purse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    November 2005, charges were initially scheduled for trial on August 31, 2006.  Prior
    to that date, the complainant reviewed her video statement with a different
    police officer, Sgt. Taylor, with whom she apparently had a more comfortable
    rapport.  She gave a further video statement and revealed the details of
    other allegations, including the alleged sexual assault.  This resulted in
    the initial trial being adjourned and the laying of a series of additional
    charges on September 13, 2006.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Charges</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was ultimately charged with three counts of assault, two counts
    of uttering death threats and one count of sexual assault.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Count 1 (Threatening Death)</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that in the Fall of 2004 (around Thanksgiving), the
    appellant and their daughter returned from his parents home and she noticed
    S.s genital area was very red and swollen.  She was told that the appellants
    mother had changed the childs diaper.  When she suggested that they take
    her to the hospital, she said, the appellant told her that if she did he
    would get his biker friends from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia to come and disappear [her] from the face of the earth.  She
    took this as a threat and did not take the child to the hospital.  This complaint
    was one of the incidents first mentioned to P.C. Kuivenhoven on November
    10, 2005.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Count 2 (Assault)</span></i></h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count
    2 relates to the complainants evidence that in November 2004, the appellant
    kicked her in the back and buttocks area while she was sitting on the couch
    watching television.  She said it was a strong hit, like someone kicking
    a soccer ball.  She said that when she asked the appellant why he had done
    that he laughed and asked her if it had hurt. </p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Count 3 (Assault)</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that in Spring 2005, the appellant without warning
    punched her in the face in the kitchen, causing her to fall down and hit
    her head between the counter and the stove.  She said that the appellant
    was laughing at her when she was on the floor, asked her if he had hurt her
    and told her not to tell anyone about it.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Count 4 and 5 (Assault and Threaten Death)</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counts
    4 and 5 relate to an alleged altercation during an argument at the top of
    the stairs in late Summer 2005, when the appellant and the complainant were
    quarrelling again about S. going to his parents home without the complainant
    being present.  The complainant said that while she stood at the top of the
    staircase, the appellant grabbed her by the neck, pushed her to the ground
    and stated, Im going to kill you, Im going to kill you.  He continued
    to squeeze her neck while she lay on the ground.  She said that she had pain
    in the centre of her neck for two days following this incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant denied that any of the foregoing, alleged incidents of assault
    and death threats ever occurred.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Count 6 (Sexual Assault)</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final count concerned the sexual assault that is said to have led to the
    birth of  S.  The complainant testified that during an evening in late February
    2003, while she was lying in bed reading, the appellant entered the room,
    naked, and forced unprotected sexual intercourse on her, while repeatedly
    stating, I want a baby now, I want a baby now.  She said she was neither
    physically nor emotionally ready to conceive at that point, having miscarried
    just three months earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant agreed that he and the complainant had had sexual intercourse on
    the evening in question.  He said it was consensual.  They had returned from
    a celebratory dinner that evening after they had agreed to start a family
    and became amorous.</p>
  <h3>THE DECISION AT TRIAL</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellants evidence in its entirety and convicted
    him on all six counts.  She found that he attempted to show himself in the
    best light possible by taking every opportunity he could to disparage the
    complainant and by providing misleading evidence with respect to his criminal
    record.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The trial judge also found that the appellant
    had provided nonsensical answers during his evidence, and that his evidence
    was replete with inconsistencies and contradictions  both internally and
    externally in contrast, particularly, to the evidence of P.C. Kuivenhoven.  Although
    he testified in some detail about the sexual activity that occurred the night
    S. was conceived, the trial judge concluded that because as he said, they
    performed the act in the same way they always did, the appellants detailed
    recall did not particularly enhance his credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the trial judge found the complainant to be a believable
    witness who testified in a straightforward manner, without embellishment
    or exaggeration, without attempting to disparage the appellant, and without
    wavering from her testimony as to what happened at the time of the sexual
    assault and the commission of the other assaults and threats.  Although the
    delay in the complainants disclosures raised some concerns, the trial judge
    found her explanations to be believable and acceptable.  She concluded that
    the complainants lack of specific recall concerning the sexual assault
    [was] not surprising because there was no reason for her to recall [those]
    secondary details since the complainant did not realize until much later
    that what had occurred was a criminal offence.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Mr. Humphrey concedes there was evidence which, if properly considered and
    accepted, could support the appellants convictions, the problem to be addressed
    on this appeal is whether the appellant received a fair trial.  Respectfully,
    in my view, he did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    did not because the trial judge erred in a number of ways which, when taken
    together, require that a new trial be ordered.  These errors fall principally
    into two categories.  First, when her reasons are read as a whole, it is
    apparent the trial judge applied different standards of scrutiny in assessing
    the evidence of the appellant and of the complainant.  A balanced and even-handed
    examination of the evidence is particularly important where, as here, the
    case turns almost entirely on the credibility of the accused and the complainant.  Yet
    the trial judge held the appellant accountable for every frailty and inconsistency
    she observed, but glossed over with very little critical analysis a number
    of significant internal and external inconsistencies and weaknesses in the
    complainants testimony  in particular, important contradictions between
    her testimony and that of P.C. Kuivenhoven.   Secondly, this unbalanced approach
    was either fed by, or itself fed, a misapprehension of the appellants testimony
    in significant places. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    shall turn to these issues after a brief review of the governing legal principles.</p>
  <h3>The Applicable Principles</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    agree on the applicable legal principles.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Different Standards of Scrutiny</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument that a trial judge has applied a different level of scrutiny in
    assessing the evidence of the accused and the complainant, as Doherty J.A.
    noted in <i>R  v. Howe</i> (2005), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
    59, is a difficult argument to make successfully.  The unbalanced scrutiny
    must be clearly demonstrated in the reasons for judgment or the trial record.  Doherty
    J.A. continued, in the same paragraph:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not enough to show that a different trial
    judge could have reached a different credibility assessment, or that the
    trial judge failed to say something that he could have said in assessing
    the respective credibility of the complainant and the accused, or that he
    failed to expressly set out legal principles relevant to that credibility
    assessment.  <i>To succeed</i> in this kind of argument, <i>the appellant
    must point to something</i> in the reasons of the trial judge or perhaps
    elsewhere in the record <i>that make[s] it clear that the trial judge had
    applied different standards in assessing the evidence of the appellant and
    the complainant</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question is whether that rigorous test has been met here.  </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Misapprehension of Evidence</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    misapprehension of the evidence warranting appellate interference requires
    more than a mere misstatement or inaccuracy in the trial judges treatment
    of the evidence.  The trial judge must be mistaken as to the substance of
    material parts of the evidence and those errors [must] play an essential
    part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction: <i>R v. Morrissey</i> (1995),
    22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 541, <i>per</i> Doherty J.A., adopted in <i>R
    v. Lohrer</i>,<i> </i>[2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, <i>per</i> Binnie J. at paras.
    1-2. In such circumstances, as Doherty J.A. observed, the accused has not
    received a fair trial and has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice;
    this is so even if the evidence at trial was capable of supporting a conviction: <i>Morrissey</i>,
    at p. 541.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the criteria for setting aside his conviction on
    both different standard of scrutiny and
    misapprehension of the evidence grounds exist here.  He asserts that the
    trial judge failed to address important aspects of the evidence in making
    her overall assessment of the complainants credibility.  He also asserts
    that she misapprehended the evidence she did consider in significant ways.  These
    two errors  alone and in combination  were central to the trial judges
    reasoning process and key to the fairness of her decision because, as she
    herself observed, she had to consider whether she believed the complainant
    when conducting the third part of the <i>W.</i>(<i>D.</i>) analysis.  She
    asked herself:  Was [the complainant] credible?  Was her evidence reliable?  Was
    there other evidence that supported the reliability of her evidence <i>or
    was there other evidence that supported the accused, such as to raise a reasonable
    doubt in [the trial judges] mind</i>? [Emphasis added.]   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, the appellants arguments  different standards of scrutiny
    and misapprehension of the evidence  overlap and find common ground in the
    record at times as the trial judges treatment of evidence now and then crossed
    the boundaries between the two.</p>
  <h3>The Trial Judge Applied a Different Standard of Scrutiny</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record reveals a number of instances where the trial judge applied a different
    standard in assessing the evidence of the appellant and the complainant.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Contradictions Between the Evidence
        of P.C. Kuivenhoven, the Appellant and the Complainant</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
    the most significant of these is the difference in the manner in which she
    treated contradictions between the evidence of P.C. Kuivenhoven and that
    of the appellant and the complainant.  P.C. Kuivenhoven was an important
    witness 
    the only truly independent witness as to what happened at the home on November
    10 and the person who took the complainants videotaped statement later that
    day.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge relied on a significant contradiction between the evidence of
    P.C. Kuivenhoven and that of the appellant in rejecting the appellants testimony.  She
    said: It is helpful in assessing the credibility of the defendant to refer
    to the evidence of Constable Kuivenhoven and how the defendants evidence
    conflicts with that of the police officer.  She then went on to relate that
    the appellant had testified it was only when the police were about to leave
    the house, having given advice without seeking to remove him, that the complainant
    suddenly called out that she had been assaulted.  P.C. Kuivenhovens testimony
    did not support this and clearly refute[d] the appellants evidence, the
    trial judge found.  This one contradiction was an important consideration
    in the trial judges negative credibility finding with respect to the appellant.  There
    is no dispute that she was entitled to  indeed, required to  take this
    inconsistency into account in her overall assessment of the appellants credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    stark contrast to this, however, is the way the trial judge dealt with similarly
    telling inconsistencies between the complainants testimony and that of P.C.
    Kuivenhoven.  The trial judge ignored them, or simply glossed over them without
    any meaningful attempt to reconcile or to explain them. There were at least
    two of these in the case of the complainant. </p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(i) Whether the Complainant Told P.C. Kuivenhoven
        She had been Sexually Assaulted</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the complainant insisted  twice in her examination-in-chief and twice in
    cross-examination  that she told P.C. Kuivenhoven at the time of her video-taped
    interview on the day of the arrest that she had been sexually assaulted and
    that he [i.e., the appellant] raped me.  For example, in examination-in-chief
    she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    had, after the videotape or before I dont remember, he had a questionnaire
    on the paper.  So he was asking me questions and one of the questions was
    about any sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Okay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    mentioned to police officer Kuivenhoven about the incident how I got pregnant
    with S.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    that moment I told him please dont write anything down because my husband
    is already in a big trouble.  I dont want him to be in more trouble than
    he is now.  And I was actually we were in that question for a few minutes
    and [I] tell him [S.] wasnt a planned pregnancy.  <i>He actually raped me</i>.  <i>And
    I remember very well telling him</i>, like he was my husband.  How can he
    rape his wife?  Its like I was feeling like his slave and he could do anything
    he wanted to me. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later,
    in cross-examination, the complainant gave the following answers:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am going to repeat some of these questions [that P.C. Kuivenhoven had asked
    from the Assault Risk Assessment] and I am going to draw your attention to
    the box that has been marked to see if you recollect giving any answers.  The
    fourth line down:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Has the accused ever sexually assaulted the victim
    and/or previous partner?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And you will notice that no is xed.  Did that
    question get put to you by Officer Kuivenhoven?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    did you indicate that answer no?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    told him that [S.] came up from a rape and <i>I told him please dont write
    down anything about sexual assault</i> because I do not want my husband to
    be in more trouble than he is already in.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>[I]
    [j]ust want to ask you the question again.  All I need is a yes or a no at
    this point.  <i>Did you answer no to that question?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>I
      answer yes</i> but I ask him not to write it down.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P.C.
    Kuivenhoven testified, on the other hand, that the complainant had denied
    the appellant had sexually assaulted her, as the x in the box referred
    to above on the questionnaire indicated.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge does not deal with this important <i>contradiction</i>.  At least,
    if she does, she does so only very indirectly and no findings are made.  Her
    entire treatment of the subject is found in the following paragraphs of her
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Constable Kuivenhoven had filled out an interview
    form when he interviewed the complainant.  I note from the evidence that
    [the complainant] did not see his answers and he did not review them with
    her.  What he wrote was a summarized version of what she had said.  I note
    from the videotape that the child was a significant distraction in this question
    and answer process.  Constable Kuivenhovens notes were incomplete.  She
    had asked him not to write down what she said after a certain point.  Constable
    Kuivenhoven admitted that there was more information given by the complainant,
    which was not in his notes nor on the form.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Constable Kuivenhovens interview with her focused
    on ascertaining details of physical violence only and specific dates.  He
    dissuaded her from talking about her concerns about the child in the care
    of the grandparents because that was the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kitchener jurisdiction.  <i>Although the complainant did not tell Kuivenhoven
    that her husband had sexually assaulted her she said [S.] was not planned
    and that [S.] was not an accident.</i> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The complainants evidence, confirmed by what Sergeant
    Taylor had testified to, was that her concern was about the child.  In general
    the gist of the complainants explanation is that it was not until she went
    to the womens shelter and learned about abuse and its many forms and had
    the time to reflect that she realized that the conduct she had been subjected
    to by her husband constituted abuse in several forms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    the trial judge appears to be suggesting is this: all the complainant did
    was say something to P.C. Kuivenhoven that in her mind related to sexual
    assault but that would not be enough to draw the officers attention to the
    fact that she was complaining about a sexual assault.  As Mr. Humphrey points
    out, however, the complainants actual evidence was very different than that.  Moreover,
    if, on the other hand, the trial judge was making a finding in the passage
    cited above that the complainant <i>had</i> reported a sexual assault to
    Constable Kuivenhoven at the time of the videotaped interview, such a finding
    would conflict with P.C. Kuivenhovens clear evidence that the complainant
    had not reported a sexual assault and that if she had, he would have noted
    it because it was a serious offence and ordinary protocol required that it
    be investigated.  This, too, has implications for the overall assessment
    of credibility using P.C. Kuivenhovens testimony as the benchmark, as I
    shall explain in a moment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, if the complainants further testimony is true, that she did not
    appreciate that she had been the subject of a sexual assault or that a husband
    could rape his wife until sometime after November 10, 2005, when she had
    received counselling at the womens shelter  to which the trial judge alluded
    in the passage cited above  it is unlikely that she would have told the
    police officer on November 10 that she had been sexually assaulted or raped. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conflict between P.C. Kuivenhovens evidence and the complainants on this
    point is important on two fronts at least.  First, it touches on a central
    aspect of the defences case, namely the complainants eve-of-trial delay
    in reporting the alleged sexual assault and subsequent complaints of assault
    and threats.  The trial judge acknowledged that the delay in disclosure
    would raise concerns, but she concluded that the complainants explanations
    were believable and acceptable.   She said that the assessment of the complainants
    credibility is not to be sacrificed to some erroneous stereotype of how
    women are expected to act after they have been assaulted or [mistreated]
    in domestic relationships marked by emotional or physical abuse as the complainant
    testified her marriage was.  The proper rejection of unacceptable stereotyping
    is not a substitute for proper scrutiny and analysis of the complainants
    delayed reporting, however.  By failing to resolve the foregoing contradiction
    between the testimony of P.C. Kuivenhoven and the complainant 
    and others that I will review below  in arriving at her overall assessment
    of the credibility and reliability of the complainants evidence, the trial
    judge committed reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the complainant did tell the police on the day the appellant was arrested
    that he had raped her, then the defence attack founded on the delay in reporting
    the sexual and other assaults is weakened, and any responsibility for postponing
    disclosure and deferring the laying of charges is at the feet of the Crown.  The
    point is therefore central to the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    if the complainant is believed on this point, then P.C. Kuivenhovens credibility
    is called into question.  P.C. Kuivenhoven is the only truly independent
    witness of import in the case.  If his credibility is shaken, there are implications
    for the trial judges assessment of <i>the appellants </i>evidence.  How
    could the trial judge reject the appellants evidence on the basis that it
    conflicted with the police officers recollection of what occurred in the
    house at the time of arrest  at least without some analysis and explanation,
    which she failed to provide  if she had found the police officer to have
    lied on the important issue of whether he had been told by the complainant
    that the appellant had raped her?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    problems were not resolved by the trial judge.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(ii) Whether P.C. Kuivenhoven Told the Complainant
        the Appellant Would Be Home in Six Weeks</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a second area of conflict between the evidence of P.C. Kuivenhoven and
    that of the complainant on a point of importance.  The complainant testified
    that she did not know the appellant would be charged, that she was shocked
    he was being taken into custody, and that the police told her the appellant
    would return to the house in six weeks.  P.C. Kuivenhoven testified, however,
    that he did not advise the complainant the appellant would return in six
    weeks and that he would have explained to her that charges would be laid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge forgave this inconsistency without any analysis and seemingly
    without foundation.  Yet it, too, was telling.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I did not view with suspicion the fact that to
    Constable Kuivenhoven she appeared normal and calm at the station.  She appeared
    to be under the impression that the accused would be coming home after six
    weeks.  Constable Kuivenhoven denied having told her that her husband would
    be home in six weeks <i>and yet that was her understanding, correct or not</i> and
    there would certainly be no benefit to the defendant for her to lie about
    that point. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    the trial judge makes no attempt to resolve the conflict.  She simply explains
    it away.  But on what basis?  On the record, there is no other possible source
    for her understanding, correct or not than the statement the complainant
    attributes to P.C. Kuivenhoven.  Yet if the complainants version is correct,
    there are implications again for P.C. Kuivenhovens credibility  not addressed
    by the trial judge 
    and indirectly for the trial judges rejection of the appellants testimony
    based on its contradictions with the police officers evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence argued that there was another reason why she appeared normal and
    calm to P.C. Kuivenhoven by the time she gave her statement later in the
    day on November 10: she had accomplished her goal of having the appellant
    removed from the house, and was therefore feeling at ease.  At trial, the
    defence argued that the complainant had two motives to get the appellant
    out of the house.  First, she did not want to appellant to take the child
    to his parents without her consent or without her being present.  Second,
    she wanted to avoid having to sign the mortgage documents that were about
    to be presented for signature.  In short, her normal and calm demeanour
    went to her motive to fabricate. Without analysing this aspect of the defence
    case, the trial judge was apparently satisfied that the complainant was normal
    and calm because she wasnt worried about her husbands fate since she had
    been assured that he would be home in a few weeks.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Mortgage Issue</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mortgage issue played a central role at trial.  The appellant and his parents
    testified that the appellants father had loaned the couple a total of about
    $64,000 to purchase their house in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Woodstock.  Although there was no mortgage placed on the home initially,
    it was agreed that the appellant and the complainant would repay the appellants
    father.  The complainant maintained that at least some of the monies were
    a gift.  At the end of September or the beginning of October 2005, the appellant
    and the complainant applied for a mortgage with the Ontario Mortgage Centre.  On
    November 8, a $75,000 mortgage was approved.  The appellant testified that
    when the mortgage representative called to arrange for signatures on the
    paperwork, the complainant no longer wished to sign.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, it was a key theme of the defence at trial that the complainant
    had a motive to fabricate her story because she wanted the appellant out
    of the house so that she would not have to sign the mortgage documents. The
    appellant testified in examination-in-chief that the mortgage papers had
    to be signed by November 10.  In cross-examination, he conceded that the
    mortgage commitment gave them until the 15<sup>th</sup> to sign.  The trial
    judge fastened on this discrepancy in rejecting the appellants evidence
    on the motive to fabricate/mortgage papers issue.  This, she was entitled
    to do.  However, she made no finding on the issue of the financing of the
    matrimonial home  that is, as to whether it had been financed through a
    loan (as three witnesses, including the appellant, testified) or a gift (as
    the complainant maintained was at least partly the case). In specifically
    leaving this issue unaddressed and in failing to resolve this issue, she
    avoided having to make a potentially negative credibility finding against
    the complainant that could have affected her ultimate assessment of the complainants
    credibility and, as a consequence, her conclusions under the third stage
    of the <i>W. </i>(<i>D.</i>) analysis.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Other Examples of Uneven Treatment
        of the Evidence</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record reveals other examples of uneven treatment between the evidence of
    the appellant and that of the complainant.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(i) Details of the Sexual Assault</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, for example, the appellant was able to testify, as the trial
    judge observed, in considerable detail about the circumstances leading
    up to, and the sexual encounter in late February 2003, when S. was conceived.  The
    trial judge found that [t]his detailed recall did not particularly enhance
    his credibility, however.  The complainant, on the other hand, could not recall
    details [of the event] to the same extent, but this apparently did enhance <i>her</i> credibility.  The
    trial judge did not find her lack of recall surprising. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    it was not the details of the sexual act that were particularly significant
    to the issue of consent.  It was the context in which the sexual act occurred.  The
    appellant said they had returned home from a celebratory dinner after they
    had decided to start a family again.  If true, this was hardly
    a secondary detail or something they did in the same way that they always
    did.  It was open to the trial judge to reject the appellants story, of
    course.  But the basis on which she did so does not appear even-handed, with
    respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken
    in isolation, this different treatment may be of little moment.  Indeed,
    there may be a legitimate basis for a trial judge to take a different view
    of testimonial detail or lack of it.  Viewed as part of the trial judges
    approach to the assessment of credibility as a whole, however, it provides
    another example of uneven scrutiny of the appellants and the complainants
    evidence.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(ii) Character Attacks</span></i></h3>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, on at least three occasions the trial judge noted as a negative
    in reviewing the appellants credibility that the appellant had gone out
    of his way to malign the character and credibility of the complainant, whereas
    the complainant was fair to the defendant and spoke positively of him.  This,
    too, is an unbalanced assessment of the evidence.  The record reveals that
    the complainant was herself quick to take opportunities to criticize the
    appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, she complained that the appellant never remembered their anniversary.  She
    volunteered that [u]sually he was  downloading porn from the internet when
    asked about his working on the Internet.  She took advantage of a question
    about his mother coming to visit to point out that the appellant didnt
    want to take any responsibility [for] the baby. When questioned about why
    she had not mentioned the circumstances of her second pregnancy to her mother,
    the complainant saw fit to accuse the appellant of dealing in drugs and added
    a second reference to the porn issue for good measure (I didnt want to
    tell anything about my husbands behaviour even with the drugs he was dealing
    with or anything else or the porno he was addicted to) and to reiterate
    her concerns about the aggressive behaviour from my husband towards the
    baby.  Finally, while having to cope with cross-examination on whether she
    had told P.C. Kuivenhoven that she had been sexually assaulted, she averted
    the question momentarily by pointing out that there were other questions
    on his questionnaire about weapons and adding  no doubt to ensure that the
    trial judge was aware of it  that the appellants father has a gun and
    that the appellant always had a huge knife next to the bed (which she had
    given to the police the following day).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    it would have been open to the trial judge to reconcile these various comments
    in her credibility analysis.  But her conclusion on this record that the
    appellant referred to [the complainant] in negative terms for the most part,
    whereas on the other hand, the complainant spoke positively about [the appellant] reinforces
    the view that the trial judge took an unbalanced approach and applied different
    standards of scrutiny to her assessment of the evidence of the appellant
    and the evidence of the complainant.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(iii) The Complainants Statement to Her Counsellor
        at the Womens Shelter</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is one other potentially significant contradiction in the evidence of the
    complainant that was not addressed by the trial judge and that related to
    the key question of delayed reporting.  The complainant testified that she
    believed she told Kathy, her counsellor at the womens shelter during the
    period of November-December 2005, that she had been sexually assaulted. Again,
    if true, this would undermine the force of the appellants defence.   But
    there was no contemporaneous report of this to the police, either by the
    complainant or the shelter, and the complainant did not advise Sgt. Taylor
    at her eve-of-trial interview in August 2006, of any such statement to the
    counsellor.  This contradiction was not mentioned by the trial judge.</p>
  <h3>Misapprehension of the Evidence and Findings of Confirmation Where None
    Existed</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    will be apparent from the foregoing recitation that a number of the unbalanced
    scrutiny examples border on, and sometimes cross over into the terrain of,
    errors involving the misapprehension of, or failure to deal with, material
    pieces of evidence.  In addition, however, the trial judge specifically and
    identifiably misapprehended the appellants evidence in at least three relevant
    respects, and used her view of the misapprehended evidence as corroboration
    of the complainants testimony.  She erred in this regard, because no such
    confirmation existed.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Appellant Did Not Admit He and
        the Complainant Argued</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge attributed an admission to the appellant in relation to the
    alleged threat and assault at the top of the staircase in late Summer 2005.  The
    trial judge said that the appellant admit[ted] they argued but denie[d]
    assaulting or threatening [the complainant].  Such an admission would, indeed,
    have been very damaging to the appellant in relation to those counts.  However,
    the appellant made no such admission.  He was unwavering throughout his testimony
    that he and the complainant did not have
    arguments and that when they had disagreements he never raised his voice.  He
    was adamant that no such incident ever occurred. The trial judge was entitled
    to reject the appellants evidence that he and the complainant never argued  as
    she did, finding it simply not credible  but she was not entitled to rely
    on an <u>admission</u> not made to found a conviction. The Crown concedes
    the trial judge erred in attributing such an admission to the appellant.  Mr.
    Skerkowski submits that the misapprehension does not constitute an error
    warranting appellate interference.  I do not agree.  This error, alone, might
    well be sufficient to quash the conviction and to require a new trial on
    counts 4 and 5, in my opinion.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'><span

  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'><span

  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'><span

  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Appellant Did Not Recall the
        Complainant Going to Tim Hortons</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge misapprehended a part of the appellants evidence in relation
    to count 2, which had to do with the allegation that the appellant had kicked
    the complainant in the back and buttocks in November 2004.  The complainant
    had identified this complaint by reference to a trip she said she had taken
    to Tim Hortons at the time of the first snowfall that year.  The trial judge
    found that the appellant did recall a time when [the complainant] drove
    to Tim Hortons on the first snow fall of that year, although he did not
    connect that with anything specific that would have prompted her to go out
    in the snow on her own.  Again, the Crown concedes that the appellant did
    not testify he recalled such an incident.  He simply maintained that on occasion
    the complainant would take the car to go shopping.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Appellant Did Refute the Allegation
        that He Had Discouraged the Complainant from Forming Friendships</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge misapprehended the appellants evidence on the issue of whether
    the complainant had any friends in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to which she could turn in confidence.  All of her family and friends were
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:country-region>
    .  She testified that she was alone in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    with no friends with whom to share things and went on to add that the appellant
    had discouraged her from forming new friendships.  The trial judge stated
    that the appellant did not refute the complainants evidence in that regard.  She
    was wrong in this respect, at least so far as the evidence that he had discouraged
    her from forming friendships went.  The appellant did refute that statement.  His
    unequivocal evidence was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    you interfere with your wifes ability to form friendships and meet people
    outside the family circle?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown concedes that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in the foregoing
    three ways.  Mr. Skerkowski submits, however, that the misapprehensions were
    of a minor nature and were not central to the trial judges reasoning process.  While
    the discouraging friendships
    incident, standing alone, might fall into that category, the attribution
    of important admissions to the appellant in relation to the Tim Hortons
    evidence and the altercation at the top of the stairs do not, in my view.  It
    cannot be said with any confidence that the trial judges reasoning in respect
    of her convictions on those counts was not adversely affected by her misapprehension
    of the evidence.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Sabotaged Condoms</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge placed some emphasis on what she called the sabotaged condoms.  Prior
    to her pregnancy with S., the complainant had a pregnancy which ended in
    a miscarriage on November 25, 2002. The complainant testified that some time
    after S. was born, she found a box of wet condoms with pin pricks in them
    and that when asked about them the appellant simply laughed. The implication
    was that the first pregnancy was due to the sabotaged condoms. The trial
    judge said that the defendant did not refute the evidence of the sabotaged
    condoms either and used it as confirmation of the complainants version of
    events.  She said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He admits that he wanted to have another baby after
    the miscarriage but says she was equally eager.  The complainant denied this.  As
    I noted before, it appears that the defendant had been prepared to go to
    great lengths to have the complainant become pregnant.  She said she was
    not ready to have a baby, that it was too soon for them to start a family,
    and I have already referred to the box of sabotaged condoms with the pinprick
    holes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant did not refute this evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that the appellant did not refute the evidence about the condoms.  He
    was not asked about it  either by the Crown or by his own lawyer.  It is
    not necessary here to resolve the issue of who should have asked the question,
    if anyone.  The existence of the box of condoms 
    sabotaged or not  was simply not relevant to the issue of whether the complainant
    consented to the sexual intercourse that led to S.s birth, which was the
    sole issue on the sexual assault charge.</p>
  <h3>CONCLUSIONS AND DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were serious issues that needed to be resolved with respect to the contradictions
    between the testimony of P.C. Kuivenhoven and the testimony of the appellant
    and the complainant before the trial judge could properly arrive at her ultimate
    assessment of the complainants credibility.  Those issues were either not
    addressed by the trial judge because of her failure to scrutinize the evidence
    of the appellant and the complainant in a balanced fashion or they were addressed,
    but not resolved, through the lens of misapprehended or overlooked evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appellant did not receive a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Doherty J.A. noted in <i>Morrissey</i>, at p. 541, and the Supreme Court
    of Canada affirmed in <i>Lohrer</i>, at para. 1:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If an appellant can demonstrate that the conviction
    depends on a misapprehension of the evidence, then, in my view, it must follow
    that the appellant has not received a fair trial, and was the victim of a
    miscarriage of justice.  This is so, even if the evidence, as actually adduced
    at trial, was capable of supporting a conviction.</p>

    same rationale applies and the same result must flow, in my view, in those
    rare cases where  as here  the appellant [can] point to something in the
    reasons of the trial judge or perhaps elsewhere in the record that make[s]
    it clear that the trial judge [has] applied different standards in assessing
    the evidence of the appellant and the complainant: <i>Howe</i>, at para.
    59.  In such a case  even where the record may otherwise be capable of supporting
    a conviction, had the evidence been properly assessed and the complainant
    believed  the appellant has not received a fair trial and has thus been
    the victim of a miscarriage of justice.</p>

    remedy is to allow the appeal and to order a new trial, which I would do.  </p>

    appellant testified in chief that he had pled guilty to possession of marijuana
    years earlier following a high school party and been given probation, whereas
    in fact he had pled guilty to possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking
