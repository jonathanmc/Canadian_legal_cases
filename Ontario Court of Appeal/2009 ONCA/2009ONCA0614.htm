    an altercation in a parking lot, the respondent, Joan Samuels, ran over a
    man with her car, seriously injuring him.  She was charged with attempted
    murder, aggravated assault and leaving the scene of an accident.  The main
    issue at trial was whether she drove at the victim intentionally, or whether,
    as she testified, she panicked and, fearing for her life, ran over him accidently
    as she fled the parking lot.  The jury acquitted Ms. Samuels on all three
    charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals the acquittals and seeks a new trial.  The Crown’s main ground
    of appeal is that on the crucial issue of Ms. Samuels’ intent, the trial
    judge erred in law by instructing the jury that it could consider whether
    Ms. Samuels was intoxicated from the consumption of crack cocaine.  The Crown
    submits that this instruction had no evidentiary basis, and that the resulting
    error infected the jury’s verdict on all three charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s secondary ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by failing
    to properly instruct the jury on a witness’
    speculation that the victim was carrying a gun when the incident took place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

      evening, the parties had arrived at the parking lot of an apartment building
      in

    the curb and in between two other cars.</span></p>

      Blair and Ms. Samuels began a heated argument over the return of her car.  Ms.
      Samuels got into the driver seat of the car and a friend, Ms. Moore, got
      into the passenger seat.  Ms. Samuels begged Mr. Blair for her keys.  He
      became angry and threw a bottle at her, which hit her in the face.  He
      banged on the hood of the car, and threw the keys at her. </span></p>

      Samuels testified that she panicked.  She wanted to get out of the parking
      lot as quickly as possible.  She started the car, attempted to put it into
      reverse and hit the accelerator.  She banged into the car beside her, slammed
      on the brakes, went into reverse again, and had to slam on the brakes again
      to avoid hitting a car moving through the parking lot.  </span></p>

      Samuels decided that she would get out of the parking lot by going over
      the curb onto the grass, and doing a U-turn back onto the pavement further
      down the lot where there were no cars.  As she crossed the grass, she hit
      a 10-foot sign post, which in turn hit Mr. Blair on the head, knocking
      him down.  Ms. Samuels then drove over Mr. Blair, dragging him under her
      car for 30 feet.  </span></p>

      testimony are relevant on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      Ms. Moore testified that when the incident occurred, she was worried that
      Mr. Blair might have a gun and use it.  No evidence was led that Mr. Blair
      in fact had a gun.  Ms. Moore’s speculative comment gives rise to the secondary
      ground of appeal advanced by the Crown.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      Ms. Moore testified that as Ms. Samuels ran over Mr. Blair with her car
      she said “meet Adam”.  Adam was the pet name Ms. Samuels used for her car.  However,
      Ms. Samuels denied that she said “meet Adam”.  </span></p>

      Moore’s evidence of the “meet Adam” comment, if accepted by the jury, was
      damning evidence of Ms. Samuels’ state of mind.  Thus I agree with Ms.
      Maunder, counsel for Ms. Samuels, that in acquitting Ms. Samuels the jury
      must have rejected Ms. Moore’s testimony on this point.  Indeed, for reasons
      that need not be detailed here, there were many reasons to find Ms. Moore’s
      testimony unreliable.  </span></p>

      about $1,000 worth of crack cocaine, all supplied by Mr. Blair.  By 6:00

      s. 676(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the Crown may appeal against
      a verdict of acquittal on a question of law alone.  However, even if a
      trial judge commits a legal error in instructing a jury, the Crown bears
      a heavy onus to overturn an acquittal.  Under the standard established
      by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Vezeau v. The Queen</i> (1977), 28
      C.C.C. (2d) 81, at p. 87, “it was the duty of the Crown, in order to obtain
      a new trial, to satisfy the court that the verdict would not necessarily
      have been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury”.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Later
      decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada on the <i>Vezeau</i> standard
      reflect the underlying proposition that a verdict of acquittal is not lightly
      to be overturned.  For example, in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
      345, at p. 374, Sopinka J. for the majority emphasized that the Crown’s
      onus is “a heavy one… [it] must satisfy the court with a reasonable degree
      of certainty”.  And in its recent decision in <i>R. v. Graveline</i> (2006),
      207 C.C.C. (3d) 481, at para. 14, Fish J. for the majority wrote that for
      an accused who has been acquitted to be sent back for a new trial, the
      Crown must “satisfy the appellate court that the error (or errors) of the
      trial judge might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the
      case at hand, to have had a material bearing on the acquittal”.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      will become apparent from the balance of these reasons, I am not convinced
      that the trial judge’s charge to the jury was infected by any legal error.  However,
      even if it was, the Crown has not persuaded me that it has met the heavy
      onus required of it to obtain a new trial.  I would therefore dismiss the
      Crown’s appeal.</span></p>
  <h3>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial judge err in her instructions to the jury on the <i>mens rea</i> for
    attempted murder?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that in her instructions on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted
    murder, the trial judge erred by leaving for the jury’s consideration Ms.
    Samuels’ intoxication from the consumption of crack cocaine.  The Crown says
    that from the trial judge’s instructions, the jury would have understood
    they could find that Ms. Samuels’ use of crack cocaine negated the specific
    intent required for attempted murder.  The Crown submits that the instructions
    were legally wrong because an intoxication defence had no air of reality.  In
    other words, it lacked an evidentiary basis on which a jury, acting reasonably,
    could acquit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Drug
    use permeated the evidence at trial.  However, Ms. Samuels acknowledges that
    the evidence stopped short of showing she was intoxicated at the time of
    the incident.  Thus, Ms. Samuels agrees with the Crown’s argument that if
    the trial judge left the defence of intoxication with the jury, the trial
    judge fell into error by doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in response to the Crown’s argument, Ms. Samuels makes two points.  First,
    she says that the trial judge did not instruct the jury on Ms. Samuels’ drug
    use as a stand-alone defence of intoxication but as one of a number of factors
    possibly bearing on her state of mind – in substance, what has come to be
    known as a rolled-up charge.  Second, Ms. Samuels says that even if the trial
    judge erred in her instructions, the error did not meet the <i>Vezeau</i> standard
    as it could have had no material bearing on the acquittal.  I agree with
    both of Ms. Samuels’ points.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge charged the jury at some length on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted
    murder.  She repeatedly and correctly told the jury that to find Ms. Samuels
    guilty of attempted murder, they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that
    Ms. Samuels intended to kill Mr. Blair.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then reviewed for the jury the evidence bearing on Ms. Samuels’ state
    of mind.  In that review, the trial judge adverted to Ms. Samuels’ crack
    cocaine consumption.  The Crown specifically objects to the following passage
    from the trial judge’s charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You will consider also the effects of the crack
    on the accused at the time of the incident.  In taking this into account
    you should consider the testimony of Ms. Moore and the testimony of the accused.  According
    to Ms. Moore, she and Ms. Samuels were “jonesing” at the time of the incident
    at 4100
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lawrence and had not smoked crack since six p.m.  Ms. Samuels testified that
    she and Ms. Moore had smoked $20 worth of crack in the back seat of the car
    on (sic) route between Twice as Nice and 4100
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lawrence.  Mr. Blair testified that the two women had not smoked in the car
    at that time.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is common knowledge that the consumption of
    drugs, such as or including cocaine, may impair or remove inhibitions and
    restraint which normally govern a person’s conduct and may impair an individual’s
    perception and ability to foresee the consequences of one’s behaviour.  It
    will be for you to determine whether Ms. Samuels was still impaired from
    the effect of the cocaine and whether this factor, assessed in the light
    of all the other circumstances, affected the necessary intent or state of
    mind required to constitute the offence of attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Crown that if this passage from the charge amounts to an instruction
    on intoxication as a stand-alone defence, then it was legally wrong.  A stand-alone
    intoxication defence would have had an air of reality only if there was evidence
    that Ms. Samuels was in a state of “advanced intoxication” from crack cocaine
    usage.  There would have had to have been evidence that she was sufficiently
    intoxicated to raise a reasonable doubt whether she foresaw the consequences
    of her actions.  No such evidence was led in this case.  See <i>R. v. Daley</i>,
    [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523 at para. 44.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I do not think that the trial judge left intoxication with the jury as a
    stand-alone defence.  Instead, she left Ms. Samuels’ drug use as one of a
    number of factors possibly affecting her state of mind at the time of the
    incident.  For example, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows: “Was
    her conduct, her actions, something that was born of fright, desire of self
    preservation in a drugged state and without an intent to kill?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    just before the passage the Crown impugns, the trial judge said: “It is up
    to you, using your experience and good common sense, to decide what evidence
    you will accept and, thus, what the facts are and whether Ms. Samuels’ actions
    were born of fright, desire of self preservation in a drug-affected state
    and without an intention to kill.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s instructions can be viewed as amounting to a “rolled-up charge”,
    a charge long recognized in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario case law.  As Weiler J.A. explained in <i>R. v. Fraser</i> (2001),
    56 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 25, “[t]he purpose of a rolled-up charge is … to
    bring to the attention of the jury evidence linking the evidence of intoxication
    with other evidence on the issue of intent.”  A rolled-up charge instructs
    the jury to consider the cumulative effect of all the evidence, including
    consumption of alcohol or drugs, on the accused’s state of mind.  If the
    cumulative effect of the evidence raises a reasonable doubt whether the accused
    acted with the requisite intent, the jury could properly acquit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    accused may be entitled to the benefit of a rolled-up charge even where the
    evidence, as in this case, may not be sufficient to sustain a stand-alone
    defence of intoxication.  As I understand the jurisprudence in our province,
    where impairment from drug use is left with the jury not as a stand-alone
    defence but as part of a rolled-up charge on the accused’s state of mind,
    the evidence of impairment need not meet the high standard prescribed by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Daley</i>.  There need only be some evidence
    that the accused consumed drugs and that this consumption might have affected
    the accused’s state of mind  See, for example, <i>R. v. Gould</i> (2008),
    244 O.A.C. 176.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    evidence existed in this case.  In addition to the evidence I have already
    reviewed, two parts of Ms. Samuels’ evidence on cross-examination are worth
    noting.  When questioned by the Crown, she testified that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am very irresponsible when I’m on drugs.  I don’t
    know.  I don’t think that well … When I’m doing drugs, I don’t really think
    at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    the Crown asked Ms. Samuels “Are you attributing that to your crack use?’ Ms.
    Samuels replied:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I don’t know – I just say – it was a very hostile
    thing.  I just got hit [with the bottle].  I was confused.  There was lots
    of excitement going on.  There was like a threat of someone coming after
    me.  There was just so many things going on at that time.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The Crown persisted and asked Ms. Samuels “So in terms of not
    knowing what was going on around you, are you now saying that it is not the
    crack, you are saying it is the excitement and the fear?”  Ms. Samuels answered, “I’m
    sure it was everything combined.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore am inclined to the view that the trial judge did not err in her
    instructions on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted murder.  Even if she did
    err, however, in my view, that error had no material bearing on Ms. Samuels’ acquittal
    on the charge of attempted murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reach that conclusion for three reasons.  First, defence counsel did not
    conduct this case on the basis that Ms. Samuels’ crack cocaine use affected
    her state of mind.  At no point did he ask the jury to conclude that because
    of her consumption of crack cocaine, Ms. Samuels did not appreciate that
    her driving might kill Mr. Blair.  He argued but one defence to the jury:
    accident.  Ms. Samuels was scared, she panicked, and in her desire to get
    away from Mr. Blair, she accidently ran over him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the jury also acquitted Ms. Samuels of the charge of leaving the scene of
    an accident.  On that charge too, Ms. Samuels’ defence was accident.  But
    in instructing the jury on the <i>mens rea</i> for that charge, the trial
    judge made no reference to Ms. Samuels’ crack cocaine consumption.  The acquittal
    on this charge thus affords powerful support for Ms. Samuels’ contention
    that her drug use played no role in the jury’s findings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    although the Crown may have had a strong case, it did not have an overwhelming
    case.  The unreliability of its witnesses, especially Ms. Moore, and the
    jury’s almost certain rejection of Ms. Moore’s “meet Adam” comment suggests
    at least some plausibility to Ms. Samuels’ version of why she did what she
    did.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial judge err in her instructions to the jury on the required intention
    for aggravated assault?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    instructing the jury on aggravated assault, the trial judge incorporated
    part of her instructions on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted murder.  She
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, let me deal with the first element.  Did the
    accused intentionally apply force to Mr. Blair?  To be an assault, the accused
    must apply the force intentionally against the will of Mr. Blair.  In essence
    the only issue here is whether Ms. Samuels intentionally drove her car over
    Mr. Blair.  I know that everybody can agree that there is no suggestion that
    Mr. Blair might have consented to having the car driven over him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Intentionally” means on purpose and not by accident.  In
    considering this element with respect to count 2, you will consider all of
    the evidence bearing on the question of whether the collision was accidental
    or whether Ms. Samuels deliberately directed her car at Mr. Blair.  You should
    refer to my discussion above of this point with respect to count 1.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find that Ms. Samuels chased Mr. Blair with
    her car as opposed to accidentally running over him, as she testified, then
    you will have concluded that for the purpose of count 2 she intentionally
    applied force to him, and you will answer “yes” to this question.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In order to determine whether her actions were
    deliberate as opposed to accidental, for the purpose of this question, you
    will consider the factors in the evidence that you took into account in count
    1 to determine Joan Samuels’ state of mind or what she meant to do. ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You should look at her conduct and words before
    and at the time that the car ran into Mr. Blair.  Again I refer you to the
    evidence with respect to count 1.  All these things and circumstances in
    which they happened may shed light on the accused’s state of mind at the
    time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown says that effectively the trial judge incorporated her reference to
    Ms. Samuels’ crack cocaine use and invited the jury to consider this usage
    in determining whether Ms. Samuels had the intent to commit aggravated assault.  The
    Crown contends that the trial judge was precluded in law from doing so because
    of s. 33.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 33.1 of the <i>Code</i>, an accused cannot disavow the intent to commit
    an offence of assault because of self-induced intoxication.  In pre-charge
    discussions, the Crown asked the trial judge to charge the jury on s. 33.1
    and to tell the jury that intoxication was not a defence to aggravated assault.  The
    trial judge refused to do so.  The Crown repeated this request when the jury
    returned with the following question: “Are we able to consider state of mind
    in relation to count 2, aggravated assault?”  Again, the trial judge declined
    to charge the jury on s. 33.1.  Instead, she said: “It is very clearly on
    the record that intoxication is not a defence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal raises the question whether instructing the jury on drug
    consumption as part of a rolled-up charge runs afoul of s. 33.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  In my view, however, it is unnecessary to answer this question.  Again,
    even if the instruction was wrong, for the reasons I gave in connection with
    the instructions on attempted murder, the Crown has not shown that but for
    the error, the jury would not necessarily have acquitted Ms. Samuels of aggravated
    assault.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial judge err in her instructions to the jury on the charge of leaving
    the scene of an accident?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argued that all three acquittals were tainted by the trial judge’s
    charge on Ms. Samuels’ crack cocaine consumption.  However, the Crown did
    not specifically challenge the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on
    the charge of leaving the scene of an accident.  Indeed, there was nothing
    to challenge.  In this part of her charge, the trial judge did not refer
    to Ms. Samuels’ crack cocaine consumption.  The Crown did not suggest another
    ground to overturn this acquittal.</p>
  <h3>5)        Did the trial judge err by failing to properly instruct the jury
    on Ms. Moore’s speculative comment that Mr. Blair was carrying a gun?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I said in reviewing the facts, Ms. Moore testified that when the incident
    occurred she thought that Mr. Blair might have a gun and might shoot at her
    and Ms. Samuels.  This comment was pure speculation.  The evidence was uncontroverted
    that Mr. Blair did not have a gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    in his closing address to the jury, defence counsel asked the jury to consider
    Ms. Moore’s comment in determining how Ms. Samuels acted that evening.  The
    Crown asked the trial judge to correct the defence’s closing and to tell
    the jury not to rely on Ms. Moore’s comment.  The trial judge refused to
    do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
    on appeal, the Crown contends that the trial judge’s failure to instruct
    the jury on the defence’s closing and on Ms. Moore’s speculative comment
    amounted to a legal error.  In my view, even if it was an error, the error
    was harmless. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not specifically correct defence counsel’s closing, she
    did instruct the jury that it could not rely on Ms. Moore’s hearsay evidence
    to draw any conclusion about Ms. Samuels’ state of mind.  Moreover, Ms. Samuels
    herself never testified that she thought Mr. Blair had a gun.  And, although
    Ms. Moore speculated that Mr. Blair might have had a gun, she also testified
    that she never saw him with a gun.  Finally, as the jury undoubtedly rejected
    Ms. Moore’s “meet Adam” testimony, I cannot think that they gave any credence
    to her speculative comment that Mr. Blair might have had a gun.  I would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
