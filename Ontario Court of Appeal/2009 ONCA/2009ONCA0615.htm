  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal pits two innocent financial institutions against each other.  Both
    are victims of a fraudulent scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roy
    Ablacksingh and others defrauded i Trade Finance Inc.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>of
    more than $11 million using their company, Webworx Inc. to perpetrate the
    fraud.  In excess of $5 million has yet to be recovered.  I shall refer to
    the monies obtained from i Trade through the fraudulent scheme as the Purloined
    Funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    questions to be resolved on the appeal are these.  Who is entitled to a sum
    of $130,117.11 plus interest (the “Disputed Funds”) currently held in trust
    by the solicitors for the appellant and traceable directly to the Purloined
    Funds?  Do the monies belong to i Trade, the financing company originally
    victimized by the fraud when it advanced the $11 million to Webworx at Mr.
    Ablacksingh’s request?  Or do they belong to Bank of Montreal (“BMO”), which
    innocently took the assets underlying the Disputed Funds as a pledge from
    Mr. Ablacksingh personally, without notice of the fraud, to secure a $75,000
    line of credit subsequently advanced by the Bank to him and his wife, Cindy
    Ramsackal?   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a motion to determine these issues, Kiteley J. ruled in favour of i Trade.  BMO
    seeks to set aside that decision.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow
    the appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    there was a fraudulent scheme is not in dispute.  Mr. Ablacksingh and others
    induced i Trade<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> to advance $11.2 million to Webworx to finance
    contracts for computer services that Webworx allegedly had with a
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    company, but which were non-existent.  Mr. Ablacksingh was the President
    of Webworx.  He and others have been convicted of criminal fraud in relation
    to the scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i
    Trade launched civil proceedings too.  In those proceedings, two things occurred
    that are pertinent to this appeal.  First, on February 23, 2004, John Macdonald
    J. ordered that the funds at issue on the appeal be held in trust pending
    a determination as to who was entitled to them, i Trade or BMO.  Second,
    on September 5, 2006, Belobaba J. granted judgment in favour of i Trade against
    Mr. Ablacksingh, Webworx and others for the amount of the Purloined Funds
    ($5,193,457.30
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Importantly, Belobaba J’s judgment also granted a tracing order in favour
    of i Trade as against Mr. Ablacksingh to assist it in
    “[determining] whether any of the funds that originated with i Trade remain
    in the hands of, or can be traced into assets in the hands of, persons <u>other
    than <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice”</u> (underlining
    added).  The Disputed Funds represent the proceeds of the sale of shares
    that were held in the joint names of Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal in
    a BMO Nesbitt Burns Investment Account (the “Investment Account”).  There
    is no disagreement that the investments in this Account were purchased by
    Mr. Ablacksingh personally, using monies traceable to the Purloined Funds
    advanced by i Trade.   Ms. Ramsackal gave no consideration for the purchases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal were joint cardholders of a Bank of Montreal
    MasterCard account.  It had a credit limit of $10,000.  In August, 2002,
    they pledged the property in the Investment Account to BMO in support of
    their request for an increase of the credit limit to $75,000.  The Bank accepted
    the pledge and agreed to provide the increased credit limit.  All parties
    agree that BMO accepted the pledge and advanced the increased credit without
    any knowledge of the fraudulent scheme or that the funds used to purchase
    the shares in the Investment Account had originated from that fraudulent
    scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    documentation was executed in connection with the pledge and increased credit
    limit.  However, no written security agreement was ever signed by Mr. Ablacksingh
    and Ms. Ramsackal with respect to the loan, and no security agreement was
    ever registered by the Bank under the <i>Personal Property Security Act</i> R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.10 (the “<i>PPSA</i>”) to protect its interests.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    Collateral Agency Agreement was executed by BMO Nesbitt Burns and by Mr.
    Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal on August 14, 2002.  For reasons not explained
    on the record, it was not executed by the Bank, although the Bank was undoubtedly
    intended to be the “Lender” referred to in the Agreement.  The Collateral
    Agency Agreement recognizes that BMO Nesbitt Burns is appointed agent for
    the Bank to hold the collateral (the pledged securities) on the Bank’s behalf
    under the Pledge Agreement.  Other documentation confirms this arrangement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part
    of the pledge arrangement was that in exchange for the increased credit,
    the value of the shares in the Investment Account would be maintained at
    a level sufficient to cover the credit line, together with interest and costs.  Accordingly,
    the Bank was entitled to receive monthly statements on the Investment Account.  At
    a point in time, the Bank discovered it was not receiving such statements
    and took steps to remedy the omission.  As part of this process, the Bank
    arranged for BMO Nesbitt Burns and Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal to sign
    a “Notice and Direction”.  The Notice and Direction specifically referred
    to the pledged Investment Account and confirmed that Mr. Ablacksingh and
    Ms. Ramsackal had granted a security interest in the Investment Account.  It
    also provided that “BMO Nesbitt Burns shall retain possession of and control
    over property in the account for the benefit of the Bank and not as agent
    for the Client.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of this documentation, BMO argues that, while it did not have a
    written security agreement with Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal, it nonetheless
    had a security agreement with them – one that was partly written and partly
    oral.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the credit limit was $75,000, the outstanding balance on the BMO MasterCard
    account is $138,747.66.</p>
  <h3>The Motion Judge’s Decision</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge ruled in favour of i Trade.  She held (a) that BMO did not have
    a security interest in the shares in the Investment Account, (b) that BMO
    was not a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value and therefore was not shielded
    from the effect of the tracing order granted by Belobaba J., and (c) that
    i Trade was entitled to the funds on unjust enrichment and constructive trust
    principles because the Pledge Agreement between BMO and Mr. Ablacksingh and
    Ms. Ramsackal did not constitute a
    “juristic reason” for the enrichment of Webworx at the expense of i Trade.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    in my view, she erred in arriving at these conclusions.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> i
    Trade’s claim to recover the funds – after tracing them to the Investment
    Account – is based on the equitable concept of unjust enrichment which it
    says impresses the funds with a constructive trust in its favour.  In addition,
    i Trade submits that this type of claim gives it an equitable lien on the
    property which prevails over the unregistered security interest of the Bank
    if, indeed, the Bank has a security interest, which i Trade does not concede.  Finally,
    i Trade contends that Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal did not have a sufficient
    proprietary right in the Investment Account to support either a security
    interest or a valid pledge to the Bank.  The Bank cannot be a “purchaser” in
    such circumstances because the fraudster had no property in the shares to
    transfer: <i>nemo dat quad non habet</i> (a party cannot give what it does
    not have to give).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are several impediments to the success of these arguments, however.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Bank Had a Security Interest Under
        the <i>PPSA</i>, But It Makes Little Difference</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge erred in holding that BMO did not have a security
    interest in the shares in the Investment Account.  The security interest
    attached, and was perfected by possession.  In the end, however, it makes
    little difference for purposes of the appeal.  This is not a priority contest
    between i Trade and BMO under the <i>PPSA</i>, and there is a serious question
    whether the <i>PPSA</i> has any application in view of s. 4(1) which provides
    that the Act does not apply to a lien given by statute or rule of law.  i
    Trade’s claim to a constructive trust in the funds, if well-founded, is arguably
    a lien given by rule of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, if the <i>PPSA</i> is applicable, I am satisfied that BMO had
    an enforceable security interest in the shares in the Investment Account.  It
    is a “purchaser” under the Act, because purchaser means “a person who takes
    by purchase” and “purchase” includes a
    “taking by pledge”: s. 1(1) (Definitions).  The interest taken is a “security
    interest” because it “secures payment or performance of an obligation” (s.
    1(1)).  And the interest “attaches” because (a) the Bank had possession of
    the collateral by virtue of the agency arrangement described above, (b) the
    Bank gave value, and (c) Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal had sufficient
    rights in the collateral to create a security interest: s. 11(2).  The security
    interest was perfected by possession: s. 22(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the Bank’s debtor, Mr. Ablacksingh, had “rights in the collateral”, as called
    for by s. 11(2)(c) of the <i>PPSA</i> is an important question in this appeal.  The
    motion judge held that the requirement in s. 11(2)(c) had not been met.  She
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>BMO’s debtors, Ablacksingh and Ramsackal, had no
    rights in the collateral that was obtained using the funds that the plaintiff
    had advanced to Webworx.  Ablacksingh could not acquire an interest in the
    collateral that he knew was obtained through his fraud.  Ramsackal could
    not acquire an interest in the collateral since she had given no consideration
    for the initial transactions with BMO.  There is no evidence the plaintiff
    intended to transfer ownership to Ablacksingh and Ramsackal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    I disagree.  Where property is turned over with the intention of transferring
    the ownership interest in it – even where the transmission is induced by
    fraud unbeknownst to the transferor – the transfer in such circumstances
    is sufficient to create a voidable interest in the transferee for purposes
    of creating a security interest: <i>R. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (2000),
    51 O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.); <i>Gray v. Royal Bank of Canada </i>(1997), 143
    D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 179 (B.C.S.C.).  Once the property has been transferred
    to a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice, however, the interest
    is no longer voidable, on the principle that a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser
    for value without notice of the fraud is not affected by the fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rationale behind this principle is well-expressed in an old American text, <u>Bump
    on Fraudulent Conveyances</u>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (1896) at pp. 489-490,
    cited with approval by Nathanson J. in <i>Bank of Nova Scotia v. Simpson</i> (1984),
    52 C.B.R. 183 (N.S.S.C. Trial Div.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Purchaser as well as Grantee Protected</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>The principle that fraud
      is only prejudicial to him who participates in it is also recognized by
      the statute. The proviso protects all interests and estates lawfully conveyed
      or assured upon good consideration and <i>bona fide</i> to a person who,
      at the time of such conveyance or assurance, has no manner of notice or
      knowledge of the covin, fraud or collusion. These terms are broad and <a name="SDU_23"></a>extensive.
      They apply to any conveyance, whether from the fraudulent grantor or fraudulent
      grantee. They are meant to protect a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for a valuable
      consideration without notice of the fraud from the operation of the statute.
      This is manifest as well from the internal evidence of the proviso as from
      the plainest maxims of equity and justice. The proviso is general. It exempts
      any conveyance upon good consideration and <i>bona fide</i> to any person
      not having notice of the fraud or collusion from the effect of the statute.
      Its benefits therefore extend to any <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for valuable
      consideration, whether he purchases from the fraudulent grantor or the
      fraudulent grantee. The great object of the law is to afford certainty
      and repose to titles honestly acquired. It is of no public utility to destroy
      titles so acquired on account of the taint of a prior secret fraud, which
      may be unsuspected and unknown, and which, probably, no diligence could
      detect. A purchaser who pays a fair price for an ostensibly fair title
      without notice of any latent fraud in any previous link of the title has
      a higher equity than the creditors. They may lose their debts; if they
      can recover the property from him he may lose the money which he paid for
      it. The equities between them are equal, and he has the legal title, and
      consequently the prior right, for the law never divests one of a legal
      title in order to invest another with it where there are no equitable reasons
      for so doing. He will therefore hold the estate purged of the anterior
      fraud that infected the title. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Central
      Newbury Car Auctions Ltd. v. Unity Finance Ltd.</i>, [1957] 1 Q.B. 371
      (C.A.), Lord Denning M.R. (albeit in dissent) drew a careful distinction
      between a true owner who is simply careless about giving up custody of
      goods and a true owner who intends or is induced to part with the property
      in them.  At pp. 381-382, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is one thing to part with possession of your
    goods.  It is quite another to part with the property in them.  If a man
    is induced to part with the property in his goods or with the power of disposing
    of them, then, even though he is induced thereto by the fraud of a rogue, <i>he
    cannot afterwards avoid the transaction as against an innocent person who
    takes in good faith and for value</i> …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It may be that he only intended to pass the property
    in the goods conditionally on being paid or on some other conditions, <i>but
    nevertheless he cannot recover them from the innocent purchaser.  It would
    be unjust to allow him to do so when he intended to part with the property
    in them and has armed the rogue with the goods or the means of disposing
    of them.</i>  He may have some private conditions or reservations, but they
    cannot affect an innocent purchaser who has no knowledge of them.  <i>The
    owner has behaved as if he intended to pass the property and must take the
    consequences</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    Court came to a similar conclusion in <i>R</i>.<i> v. Canadian Imperial Bank
    of Commerce</i>.  There, the Crown sought to obtain forfeiture of funds held
    in an account at CIBC in the name of the corporate vehicle of the architect
    of a massive fraudulent telemarketing scheme involving the sale of phony
    gemstones at inflated prices.  The Bank was a secured creditor of the company.  The
    Court held that the trial judge had erred by holding that because the proceeds
    in the account were the proceeds of crime they could not be given as security
    by the perpetrator of the fraud.  It said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relies on the case of <i>Chrysler Credit
      Canada Ltd. v. MVL Leasing Ltd.</i> (1993), 5 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 92 (Ont.
      Ct. Gen. Div.).  That case involved a stolen car, and is distinguishable
      from the case at bar.  There was never any intent by the owner of the car
      to transfer ownership to the rogue.  In this case, the victims of the gem
      scam did not know they were victims and <i>intended to forward their funds
      to R.I.C.</i> in exchange for the gemstones which they received.  <i>The
      interest of R.I.C. in the funds was voidable but not void ab initio.  The
      security interest of the bank was therefore able to attach to the funds
      deposited into the account.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    i Trade intended to transfer ownership in the Purloined Funds as directed
    by Mr. Ablacksingh.  The motion judge attempted to distinguish the foregoing
    line of jurisprudence on the basis that there was no evidence of any intention
    to pass title in the funds to Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal themselves.  In
    my view, the distinction between intending to transfer ownership to Webworx
    (the vehicle used by the fraudster to commit the fraud) at the direction
    of the fraudster, and intending to transfer ownership to the fraudster himself,
    is quite immaterial.  i Trade transferred the funds to, or at the instance
    of the fraudster, intending to pass title.  Having done so, and having – to
    adopt the language of Lord Denning – “armed the rogue with the goods or the
    means of disposing of them”, i Trade “has behaved as if [it] intended to
    pass the property and must take the consequences”: <i>Central Newbury Car
    Auctions</i>, at p. 382.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    consequences are that Mr. Ablacksingh had sufficient property in the funds
    to create a security interest and to pledge them to the Bank, a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser
    for value without notice of the fraud, and that once he did so, i Trade’s
    ability to trace the funds pursuant to the judgment of Belobaba J. was lost.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to that issue now.</p>
  <h3>The Bank was a <i>Bona Fide</i> Purchaser for Value</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that although BMO was a
    “purchaser”, it had failed to establish that it was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser
    for value without notice within the exception provided in the tracing order
    granted by Belobaba J.  This, in spite of the fact that she found in her
    reasons as follows (para. 12):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At no time did the BMO have any notice or knowledge
    that the shares within the account may have been acquired with funds improperly
    received by Ablacksingh from the funds advanced to Webworx by the plaintiff.  The
    BMO extended the credit limit in good faith without notice of any irregularity
    in respect of the shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge recognized that the chain for tracing is broken where the funds
    have found their way into the hands of a third party purchaser for value
    without notice: <i>McTaggart v. Boffo</i> (1975), 10 O.R. (2d) 733 (H.C.J.),
    at p. 750.  Her sole rationale for concluding that BMO did not fall within
    the parameters of the tracing order of Belobaba J. was that
    “BMO [was] a purchaser from Ablacksingh and Ramsackal, not a purchaser from
    Webworx.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    that distinction is equally immaterial for these purposes.  The fact that
    the Bank purchased directly from the fraudster rather than from the corporate
    vehicle used by the fraudster to perpetrate the fraud is of no moment.  BMO
    remains a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value of the funds wrongly appropriated
    by Mr. Ablacksingh.  i Trade therefore loses its right to trace the funds
    pursuant to the judgment once they fall into the hands of such a purchaser.</p>
  <h3>Unjust Enrichment</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question remains, then, whether i Trade is entitled to recover the funds
    based on principles of unjust enrichment standing alone.  Tracing is only
    a means to another remedy – in this case, unjust enrichment resulting in
    the imposition of a constructive trust.  Since there is no dispute that the
    shares in the Investment Account were purchased with monies originating in
    the Purloined Funds, it is necessary to consider whether the equitable principles
    of unjust enrichment entitle i Trade to claim the funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude they do not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles that give rise to the imposition of a constructive trust, based
    upon unjust enrichment, require the finding of (a) a benefit to or enrichment
    of one party, (b) a corresponding detriment to or deprivation suffered by
    the other party, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the benefit
    or enrichment: <i>Rathwell v. Rathwell</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 436; <i>Pettkus
    v. Becker</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834; <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R.
    980; <i>Re Attorney General of Canada v. Confederation Life Insurance Company</i> (1995),
    24 O.R. (3d) 717 (Gen. Div.), affirmed (this point not dealt with) (1997),
    32 O.R. (3d) 102 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected BMO’s submission that its otherwise valid Pledge Agreement
    with Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal was a
    “juristic reason” for the Bank’s enrichment if, indeed the Bank was “enriched”
    within the meaning of the test for unjust enrichment (which BMO contests).  She
    did so in the context of an analysis of whether <i>Webworx</i> had been unjustly
    enriched.  The Bank argues that she erred in both respects.  I agree, although
    I do not think that framing the issue to ask whether i Trade had established
    that Webworx was unjustly enriched makes much difference in the result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i
    Trade seeks to recover restitution against BMO, however, and to do so must
    show that the benefit/enrichment analysis applies as between it and the Bank.  Here,
    the Bank acknowledges that i Trade has suffered a detriment, but submits
    that BMO has not been “enriched” as that term is meant to be construed in
    the context of the unjust enrichment analysis.  The Bank took security in
    the form of the shares in the Investment Account and, in exchange, provided
    a loan on the strength of that pledge.  Having advanced the loan in good
    faith, the Bank argues that it was not “enriched” by taking the pledge in
    the sense that the cause of action of unjust enrichment seeks to address.  The
    counter-argument would be that the Bank benefitted – has been “enriched” – to
    the detriment of i Trade by being able to use i Trade’s money as security
    for its credit advance to Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal.  BMO would not
    have been able to take the security were it not for the fact that the shares
    had been purchased using the Purloined Funds, to the detriment of i Trade.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    have pointed out to us that there is little jurisprudence on the issue of
    what constitutes “enrichment” in this context.  The courts have generally
    been content to assume, without deciding, that there has been an enrichment,
    but to determine cases on the basis of the “juristic reason” analysis: see,
    for example, <i>RBC v. Harowitz</i> (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 671 (Gen. Div.),
    affirmed (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 704 (C.A.); <i>Re Attorney General of Canada
    v. Confederation Life Insurance Company</i> (Gen. Div.), at pp. 770-771.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This,
    too, is a similar case.  I am prepared to assume for purposes of the appeal,
    without deciding, that the Bank has been enriched at the expense of i Trade.  I
    am satisfied, however, that i Trade cannot succeed on unjust enrichment principles
    because there are valid juristic reasons for the enrichment.  Those reasons
    are: (i) the otherwise valid contractual arrangement between BMO and Ablacksingh/Ramsackal,
    (ii) the fact that, in law, the borrowers had sufficient property in the
    shares in the Investment Account to create a pledge, and (iii) the fact that
    BMO is a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice of the fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge correctly observed that the third element of the unjust enrichment
    analysis focuses on the “unjustness” of the situation at hand: <i>Beblow</i>,
    at p. 990; <i>Harowitz</i> (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  She essentially decided, however, that BMO –
    having obtained an agreement from Ablacksingh/Ramsackal to provide a security
    agreement, but having failed to register or take any steps required to protect
    its interests under the PPSA – should not prevail over i Trade, which was
    the victim of fraud.  She said that the agreement between the Bank and Ablacksingh/Ramsackal
    was not a juristic reason for the enrichment.  Her conclusion in this respect
    was as follows (para. 30):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the undisputed facts, the first two elements
    are satisfied;  Webworx was enriched while the plaintiff suffered consequential
    deprivation.  The third element requires an examination of the “unjustness” of
    the situation at hand.  The BMO argues that its agreements with Ablacksingh
    and Ramsackal constitute a juristic reason for the enrichment of Webworx.  Ablacksingh
    and BMO entered into commercial relationships.  Ablacksingh agreed to pledge
    the shares in the BMO Nesbitt Burns account.  The BMO obtained an agreement
    to give a security interest.  Having failed to take the requisite steps under
    the <i>PPSA</i>, it did not acquire a security interest in the BMO Nesbitt
    Burns account.  On the other hand, i Trade was a victim of fraud.  It would
    not be just to prefer BMO over i Trade.  The fact that BMO had such an agreement
    with Ablacksingh and Ramsackal is not a juristic reason that would preclude
    recovery by i Trade.  The rights BMO obtained do not defeat the plaintiff’s
    rights.  The plaintiff has established that the BMO Nesbitt Burns account
    was impressed with a constructive trust in its favour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    there are three flaws in this analysis.  First, as I have indicated above,
    BMO did obtain a security interest in the shares in the Investment Account.  BMO
    did not argue that its agreement with Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal constituted
    a valid juristic reason for the enrichment of <i>Webworx</i>; it argued,
    correctly, that the agreement constituted a valid juristic reason for the
    enrichment of <i>BMO</i>.  The latter is the appropriate comparison.  Whether
    a different conclusion respecting the existence of a security interest in
    the property in the Investment Fund would have altered the motion judge’s
    balancing of the equities is not clear.  However, had the motion judge recognized
    that, in law, Mr. Ablacksingh and Ms. Ramsackal did have a sufficient property
    interest in the shares to create the pledge, and had she focused on the enrichment
    of BMO rather than Webworx, she might well have taken a different view of
    the balance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Secondly – and
    in any event – it was an error in law for the motion judge to conclude that
    the agreement between Ablacksingh/Ramsackal and BMO was not a juristic reason
    precluding recovery by i Trade.  A valid contract leading to a debtor-creditor
    relationship between the person enriched and another – as was the case here – is
    sufficient to establish the existence of a juristic reason for an enrichment
    that can be accounted for on the basis of that contractual relationship.  In
    this regard, the absence or presence of a juristic reason in connection with
    the enrichment need not necessarily arise out of the relationship between
    the party asserting the claim for unjust enrichment (i Trade) and the party
    enriched (BMO): see <i>Re Attorney General of Canada v. Confederation Life
    Insurance Company</i> (Gen. Div.) at p. 771; <i>Rathwell v. Rathwell</i> at
    p. 455; <i>Harowitz</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    BMO entered into a valid and legitimate contract with its borrowers (Ablacksingh
    and Ramsackal), without any knowledge or notice that the assets in the Investment
    Account had been purchased using monies improperly taken by Mr. Ablacksingh
    from Webworx and improperly obtained by Webworx from i Trade through Ablacksingh’s
    fraudulent scheme in the first place.  It is not necessary that this contract
    be a “security agreement” in the technical sense of the <i>PPSA</i>, in my
    view.  It was a valid agreement to take security pledged by Mr. Ablacksingh
    and Ms. Ramsackal.  Such a valid contractual relationship has long been held
    to be one of the examples of a “juristic reason” that will defeat a claim
    for unjust enrichment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    brings me to the final consideration.  BMO’s position as a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser
    for value without notice of the fraud is not inconsequential in the third
    branch of the unjust enrichment analysis.  Equity has long protected the
    interests of someone in such a position, for the reasons summarized in the
    quotation from <u>Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances</u>, cited at para. 21 above.
    There will always be irregular or unknown transactions ensuing from a fraudulent
    scam.  As the text notes, however, at pp. 489-490:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is of no public utility to destroy titles [honestly
    acquired] on account of the taint of a prior secret fraud, which may be unsuspected
    and unknown, and which, probably, no diligence could detect.  A purchaser
    who pays a fair price for an ostensibly fair title without notice of any
    latent fraud in any previous link of the title has a higher equity than the
    creditors.  They may lose their debts; if they can recover the property from
    him he may lose the money which he paid for it.  The equities between them
    are equal, and he has the legal title, and consequently the prior right,
    for the law never divests one of a legal title in order to invest another
    with it where there are no equitable reasons for so doing.  He will therefore
    hold the estate purged of the anterior fraud that infected the title.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    hold that a contract entered into between the person
    “enriched”, without any notice or knowledge of the fraud, and the fraudster
    does not provide a juristic reason for the enrichment would defeat the purpose
    of the long-established equitable protection which the law makes available – for
    equally long-established policy reasons – to <i>bona fide</i> purchasers
    for value without notice.</p>
