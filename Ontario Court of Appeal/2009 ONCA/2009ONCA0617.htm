  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was charged with six offences involving allegations of sexual assault
    and sexual interference against three complainants, all of whom were the
    appellant’s nieces by marriage. Two of the complainants, AMS and ATS, were
    sisters. Their allegations were historical, involving time frames spanning
    between 1994 and 1999 when they were between the ages of nine and fourteen, and
    five and ten, respectively. The third complainant, JC, is a cousin of the first
    two complainants. Her allegations related to events that allegedly occurred on
    September 17, 2005, when she was fifteen years old. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      At trial,
    the Crown applied to have the evidence of the three complainants applied as
    similar fact evidence and also to lead the evidence of the sister of the S
    complainants, ALS, as similar fact evidence. Ready J. dismissed this
    application, holding among other things, that the Crown had not discharged its
    burden of negativing collusion because it had not explored with all of the
    proposed similar fact witnesses, the issue of whether their perceptions of the
    actions of their uncle were tainted by their discussions with one another. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Following
    the trial, the appellant was acquitted of the two charges relating to AMS, but
    convicted of the remaining charges relating to ATS and JC. He was later
    sentenced to twelve months imprisonment plus probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In her
    reasons for judgment, the trial judge noted that AMS demonstrated
    vindictiveness towards the appellant, the basis for which had not been fully
    explored at trial. As well, AMS acknowledged discussing her allegations a
    number of times with her mother and her sisters and was unable to say whether
    those discussions affected her perceptions. In the circumstances, the trial
    judge had concerns about both the credibility and reliability of AMS’s
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Concerning
    the remaining charges, despite certain frailties in their testimony, the trial
    judge accepted the evidence of ATS and JC. Although the appellant testified and
    denied their allegations, the trial judge rejected his evidence for three main
    reasons. First, she found him evasive when responding to questions about
    whether he owned or watched pornography. Second, she concluded he was evasive
    in responding to questions about whether he found his nieces attractive. Third,
    she found him evasive in responding to questions about whether he was ever alone
    with his nieces.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal sentence. He
    raises two issues on his conviction appeal:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred by failing to consider the
      evidence of collusion in her reasons for conviction; and</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred by apply a higher standard of
      scrutiny to the defence evidence as compared to the Crown’s evidence.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For reasons
    that I will explain, I would allow the conviction appeal and order a new trial.
    It is therefore unnecessary that I address the request for leave to appeal
    sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><b>I.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Did the
    trial judge err by failing to consider evidence of collusion in her reasons for
    conviction?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      I would not
    give effect to this ground of appeal. Counsel for the appellant fairly
    acknowledged that this ground of appeal relates to the two convictions relating
    to ATS and not to the convictions relating to JC I agree. The convictions
    relating to JC arose from events that occurred on September 17, 2005. JC made a
    videotaped statement to the police setting out her allegations on September 22,
    2005. There was no evidence at trial that JC spoke to the other complainants
    prior to making her statement to the police; moreover, JC was not
    cross-examined about that possibility. In these circumstances, there is no air
    of reality to the suggestion that JC’s allegations were tainted by collusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      However, the
    allegations made by ATS and by her sister AMS related to events that occurred
    much earlier, in time frames between 1994 and 1999. In her evidence, AMS
    described two separate incidents of alleged sexual touching by the appellant.
    She said she talked to all of her sisters about the abuse. She specifically
    recalled speaking to ALS and said that they decided to tell their mother that
    the appellant was a pervert and that he touched them. However, she acknowledged
    that she spoke to their mother in a joking manner and their mother did not
    believe her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AMS also testified that she spoke to her sisters after
    she found out about JC’s allegations; they subsequently went to the police to
    report their allegations in February 2006. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the similar fact evidence application made by the
    Crown, ALS testified about various incidents of alleged sexual misconduct by
    the appellant against her. She said she spoke to AMS and they decided to tell
    their mother. Their mother did not believe them, but rather responded that the
    appellant was probably just play fighting, or that the touching was
    accidental.  ALS also acknowledged that her
    sister AMS told her that JC had complained to the police and that she talked to
    her three sisters, AMS, ATS, and ASS, about what happened with the appellant
    for almost an hour before deciding they should tell the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the evidence of AMS and ALS indicating that ATS
    was involved in discussions about alleged abuse by the appellant before
    reporting her allegations to the police, I am not persuaded that the trial
    judge committed a reversible error by failing to allude to this evidence in her
    reasons for conviction. ATS was not cross-examined about these conversations; nor
    was she cross-examined about the possibility of collusion or tainting.
    Particularly in these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude
    that ATS’s evidence was neither tainted nor the product of collusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge's reasons on the similar fact
    application and on the trial proper demonstrate that she was alive to the
    issues of collusion and the possibility the sisters had tainted each other’s
    evidence. She dismissed the similar fact evidence application and the charges
    relating to AMS based in part on concerns about these issues. Accordingly,
    although it would have been preferable had the trial judge referred explicitly
    to the issues of collusion and tainting when dealing with the charges relating
    to ATS, considering the trial judge's reasons as a whole and in the context of
    the evidence at trial, it is only reasonable to conclude that she made a
    finding that ATS’s evidence was neither tainted nor the product of collusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II.        Did
    the trial judge err by apply a higher standard of scrutiny to the defence       evidence as compared to the Crown’s
    evidence?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by
    focusing on two insignificant issues as part of the basis for rejecting the
    appellant's evidence while, at the same time,  forgiving significant frailties in the complainants’ evidence and
    failing to subject the complainants’ testimony to meaningful critical
    examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, much of the appellant's argument is in
    reality a request that this court re-weigh the evidence and make different
    findings of fact.  However, the appellant
    also submitted that the trial judge erred by identifying the appellant's
    difficulty in answering questions about whether he found his nieces attractive
    as a basis for rejecting his evidence.  I
    agree with this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The portion of the appellant's cross-examination in
    which he was asked questions about whether he thought his nieces were
    attractive follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Sir, you think [JC] is attractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I - - she's - - she's a - - she's a - - she - -
    she was a really good girl all her life and she played sport and she's - -
    she's, you know, she's - - she's fine. I'm saying that's anything wrong with
    her, no. She's...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Can you answer my question please, sir.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes. I mean she's - -  I - - in a way where she's - -  she's a good  - - I mean she's - -  I - - I
    don't know how to answer this, because it's - - what do you mean by attractive,
    like?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Do you think that [JC] is unattractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I don't think so, no. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. So you understand what I mean by unattractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I understand, yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. So you had difficulties understanding
    attractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Well I mean - - she - - she is - - she is a
    good-looking girl, yeah, she is.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Do you think [AMS] is attractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I mean they're my nieces. I can't say they are
    ugly or anything like that, no.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Do you think [ATS] is attractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Same answer, they're my nieces. I've - - I've
    known these kids since they were little. I mean I - - I - - you know, it's - -
    they're  - - I - - I don't know what to
    say like, I mean, I've known him all my life, since they were small. And they
    grew up and I've, you know, it's - - I can't - - yes, they're - - they're - -
    they're nice kids.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Do you think [ALS] is attractive?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Again, same answer yes, they're - - they're - -
    they're nice kids, yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge identified the appellant's difficulty
    in answering these questions as one of the bases for rejecting his evidence in
    her reasons involving the charges relating to both ATS and JC. In relation to
    the charges relating to ATS, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Why have I come to this conclusion? The <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> analysis, I find the
    defence evidence is neither believable and in the alternate it does not leave
    me in reasonable doubt. [The appellant] was evasive to questions, for example,
    &quot;Do you watch porn on TV?&quot; His answer, &quot;I don't own porn.&quot;
    And then he finally, after being alerted that that was not the question, he
    finally agreed that he does watch it. He was not, therefore, forthright with
    the court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He was asked if he found his niece, [JC], to be
    attractive. He had a great deal of difficulty answering a simple question. He
    had difficulty understanding, it seems, what the word attractive versus
    unattractive meant. Again, I found him to be evasive and he was not forthright.
    I asked - he was asked if he thought the girls generally were attractive.
    Again, there was a roundabout evasive answer. Finally he settled upon,
    &quot;They are my nieces.&quot; Again, I find this to be evasive; I find it to
    lack forthrightness to the court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He was evasive in respect to questions about ever
    being alone with his nieces during the nine years that he was at the [M]
    address. First he said he was never alone over the nine years. Finally he said
    - he conceded that there was a possibility he was alone with them downstairs.
    Again, that was always conditional. He said, but his wife [T] would be there or
    [A] would be there. Again, I found that he was not being forthright with the
    court. He was being rather evasive to questions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to the charges relating to JC, the trial
    judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Why have I come to this conclusion? On the <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> analysis, I neither
    believe the accused, nor does his evidence raise reasonable doubt. The accused
    was evasive to questions in respect to watching pornography and whether JC was
    attractive. Therefore, I find that he is not being forthright with the court.
    He is not credible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are at least two problems with the line of
    questions relating to whether the appellant found his nieces to be attractive.
    Because of these problems, the questions were unfair to the appellant and the
    trial judge should not have relied upon the appellant’s difficulty in answering
    these questions in assessing his credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the questions are ambiguous. It is unclear from
    the questions  whether the Crown was
    using the term “attractive”  to mean
    ‘pretty’ or ‘sexually attractive’. In the context of a trial involving
    allegations of sexual misconduct, such ambiguity is extremely unfair to an
    accused person. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of their inherent ambiguity, from an accused
    person's perspective, there can be no right answer to such questions. An
    accused person who thinks his or her nieces are pretty could properly harbour
    concerns that an affirmative answer would be taken as an acknowledgment of
    sexual attraction and could lead to an inference that he or she was more likely
    to have committed the crime charged. Although such an inference would be
    improper in many if not most circumstances, an accused person would have no way
    of knowing whether it might be drawn because of the ambiguity of the question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the same accused person could equally have
    concerns that a negative answer could be viewed as patently false. As the
    question could properly be taken as meaning pretty, a negative answer might be
    viewed as an obvious lie and as an attempt to avoid responsibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the same token, an accused person who does not think
    his or her nieces are pretty, could find it difficult, if not impossible, to
    publicly acknowledge that view.  Finally,
    it would be apparent to many accused that any request for clarification of this
    type question could be viewed as evasiveness, as happened here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, whatever their meaning, the questions are
    essentially irrelevant. On one reading of the line of questions, they were
    directed at determining whether the appellant considered his nieces to be
    pretty. Such a line of questioning would appear to be premised on a
    stereotypical assumption that only pretty females are sexually assaulted. There
    is no empirical support for such an assumption and questions about whether the
    appellant considered his nieces pretty were therefore wholly irrelevant to the
    issues at the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On another reading of this line of questions, they were
    directed at determining if the appellant found his nieces sexually attractive.
    Except perhaps in circumstances where a particular crime involves sexually
    deviant behaviour, e.g. paedophilia, the fact that one person finds another
    sexually attractive, does not make it more likely that the first person
    sexually assaulted the second person. Even if such questions might be viewed as
    being marginally relevant, the risk of attributing undue weight to a positive
    answer should, in most circumstances, mandate their exclusion. In <i>R. v. Moose</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 521,
    at paras. 22-23, the Manitoba Court of Appeal said this about a similar line of
    questioning:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he trial judge was in error in relying upon the
    accused’s evasive answers to improper questions as the basis for rejecting his
    testimony. Assuming a positive answer, where does the question and answer lead?
    It does not follow that when a man finds a woman attractive, a sexual assault
    is likely to occur. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the questions and answers were indeed
    irrelevant for they do not tend to prove the issue before the court. Even if,
    on a broad interpretation of the inclusionary principle, it could be argued
    that the questions and answers constitute relevant evidence, it should be
    excluded because of its tenuous value and because it is unfairly prejudicial to
    the accused. See E. G. Ewaschuk, <i>Criminal
    Pleadings &amp; Practice in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, AMS was between five and ten years old at
    the time the alleged misconduct occurred. Had the questions to the appellant
    being directed at determining whether he found her sexually attractive at those
    ages when the misconduct allegedly occurred, they may have been relevant.
    However, framed as referring to whether the appellant found any of his nieces
    attractive at the time of trial, the questions were improper and the trial
    judge erred in relying on the appellant’s answers to them as a basis for
    rejecting his evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to the charges against ATS the trial judge
    identified two other reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence; his
    evasiveness in answering questions as to whether he was ever alone with his
    nieces, and his apparent evasiveness as to whether he watched pornography. In
    relation to the charges against JC, she identified one other reason; his answer
    to the question whether he watched pornography. Considering the evidence and
    the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, it is impossible to say what would have
    been the result had the trial judge not given significant weight to the
    improper questions and the appellant’s attempted answers. In the circumstances,
    I see no option but to order a new trial.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would allow the
