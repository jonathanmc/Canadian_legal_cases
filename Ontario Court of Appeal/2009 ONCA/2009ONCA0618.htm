    motorist whose negligence contributed to the accident. According to Security
    National, these factors suggest that s. 265 simply does not apply where the admitted
    negligence of an insured motorist contributed to the accident. Moreover, s.
    2(1)(c) specifically excludes the insurers obligation to pay where the injured
    party is entitled to recover money under the third party liability section of
    a motor vehicle liability policy. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the alternative, Security National relied on s. 2(1)(b) of
    the Schedule, which permits the insurer to deduct from its obligations certain
    payments made to the injured party under a valid insurance policy. It argued that
    even if an injured party has a cause of action for uninsured coverage, where
    there is an insured joint tortfeasor who admits negligence, the regulation
    excludes the insurers obligation to pay to the extent of the insured joint tortfeasors
    insurer's obligation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Security National also relied on s. 5.7 of O.A.P. 1, which
    states in plain language that the insurer will not pay where the injured party
    can make a valid claim under the liability section of a motor vehicle
    liability policy.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, Security National relied on a series of decisions
    that it says make it clear that an injured party cannot recover from his or her
    insurer on the uninsured or underinsured coverage when there is an insured
    joint tortfeasor. For example, see <i>Barton v. Aitchison</i>, (1982), 39 O.R.
    (2d) 282 (

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Security National does not say that an injured party has a
    duty to pursue every conceivable joint tortfeasor before claiming recovery
    against his or her own insurer under the uninsured coverage provisions of
    O.A.P. 1. However, Security National does contend that an injured party is not
    entitled to claim under the uninsured coverage where, as here, an insured joint
    tortfeasor admits negligence.</span></p>

    claim (because s. 265(6)<i> </i>of the<i> Insurance Act</i> only provides for
    subrogation against the uninsured owner/driver). Further, although the third
    parties consented to a question being presented to the court assuming they
    are negligent, they have not admitted either negligence or liability to pay for
    the purposes of the third-party proceeding. As a result of these factors, we
    expressed concerns that the question presented is purely hypothetical.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The starting point for determining this issue is the modern
    principle of statutory interpretation as set out in Elmer A. Driedger's <i>Construction of Statutes</i>, 2nd. ed.
    (Toronto: Butterworth, 1983), at p. 87:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one principle or approach,
    namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>However, because the Schedule is a regulation it must also be
    read with its enabling Act in mind. In <i>Bristol-Myers
    Squib Co. v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 533, after citing the modern principle
    of statutory interpretation, Binnie J. said, at para. 38:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The same edition of Driedger adds that in the case
    of regulations, attention must be paid to the terms of any enabling statute:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not enough to ascertain the meaning of a
    regulation when read in light of its own object and the facts surrounding its making;
    it is also necessary to read the words conferring the power in the whole
    context of the authorizing statute. The intent of the statute transcends and
    governs the intent of the regulation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Reading s. 265 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i> and ss. 2(1)(b) and (c) of the Schedule in context, we conclude that the
    phrase entitled to recover as it appears in ss. 2(1)(b) and (c) of the
    Schedule means entitled to recover in fact. Moreover, in our view, on a proper
    reading of these provisions, there is no requirement that an injured insured
    sue insured potential joint tortfeasor(s) in order to resort to the uninsured
    coverage. Rather, an injured insured will be disentitled from recovery under
    the uninsured coverage in O.A.P. 1 based on the negligence of an insured joint tortfeasor
    only where the joint tortfeasors insurer admits liability to pay or where the
    injured insured obtains a judgment against the joint tortfeasor. We reach these
    conclusions for several reasons.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, s. 265(1)(a) creates a broad entitlement to uninsured
    coverage for all sums [the insured] is <i>legally

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The phrase legally entitled to recover in s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> (which is essentially a
    coverage provision) has been interpreted as permitting a right of direct action
    against the insurer and as requiring only that an insured person establish
    fault on the part of the uninsured driver and prove the amount of his or her
    damages: see <i>Johnson v. Wunderlich</i> (1986),
    57 O.R. (2d) 600 (C.A.); <i>Chambo</i> <i>v. Musseau</i> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 305

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Significantly, there is no reference in s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> to an insured person being
    disentitled to uninsured coverage because of the existence of an insured joint
    tortfeasor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, the difference in language between the phrase
    legally entitled to recover in s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> and the phrase entitled to recover in s. 2(1)(b)
    and (c) of the Schedule is, in our view, very important. The omission of the
    word legally in the latter phrase suggests that, for the exclusion to apply,
    a person must be entitled to recover in fact rather than simply being entitled
    to recover as a matter of law. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>An injured insured is entitled to recover in fact only where
    a potential joint tortfeasors insurer admits liability to pay or where the
    injured insured obtains judgment against the insured joint tortfeasor.
    Moreover, liability to pay involves something more than a mere admission or
    finding of negligence.  As the contested
    facts in this case illustrate, a joint tortfeasor may admit negligence but still
    defend successfully based on a limitation defence. On our interpretation of ss.
    2(1)(b) and (c) of the Schedule, an injured insured will be precluded from
    recovery under the uninsured coverage in O.A.P. 1 only where there is an
    admission or finding of liability to pay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, case law interpreting s. 265 of the<i> Insurance Act</i> has noted that the
    section was enacted to alleviate the plight of motorists injured by drivers of
    uninsured automobiles and that the purpose of this section is to provide a
    safety net for victims injured by the actions of uninsured motorists and at
    the same time internalize costs to the activity (driving a motor vehicle)
    which created them: <i>Barton v. Aitchison</i>,
    at p. 287; <i>Gignac v. Neufeld</i> (1999),
    43 O.R. (3d) 741 (C.A.), at p. 750; <i>Chambo
    v. Musseau</i>, at p.&nbsp;308.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no indication in the language of s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> or of the Schedule that it
    was the intention of the legislature to require victims of uninsured drivers to
    engage in potentially speculative and costly litigation against potential joint
    tortfeasors who may be insured rather than relying on the coverage paid for in
    their own policies of insurance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, s. 7(3) of the <em>Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 41 and s. 7 of the Family Protection Coverage Endorsement (OPCF-44R) contained in Ms. Loftus&rsquo;s policy support our interpretation. Both of these provisions make it clear that an injured party may resort to the protection or coverage provided only as a matter of last resort. Had the legislature intended a similar result with respect to the uninsured coverage required by s. 265 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, it could have said so. The relevant provisions read as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'><u>Section 7(3) of
    the <i>Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act</i></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'>7(3) <em>The Minister shall not pay</em> out of the Fund any amount in respect of a judgment <em>unless the judgment was given in an action brought against all persons against whom the applicant might reasonably be considered as having a cause of action</em> in respect of the damages in question and prosecuted against every such person to judgment or dismissal. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Section 7 of the Family Protection Coverage Endorsement</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7. <em>The amount payable under this change form</em> to an eligible claimant is excess to an amount received by the eligible claimant from any source, other than money payable on death under a policy of insurance, and <em>is excess to amounts that were available to the eligible claimant from</em></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <em>the insurers of a person jointly liable with the inadequately insured motorist for the damages sustained by an injured person</em>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, case law interpreting s. 2(1)(b) of the
    Schedule has indicated that one of the primary purposes of that section is to
    prevent double recovery by the injured insured: <i>Kosanovic v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.</i> (2004), 70 0. R. (3d)
    161 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).
    Our interpretation of the phrase entitled to recover will prevent double
    recovery and at the same time preserve the safety net for injured insured but without
    imposing a burden of pursuing potentially costly and speculative litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, we reject Security Nationals argument
    that our interpretation will allow double recovery by permitting injured
    insured to obtain judgment against their own insurer on the uninsured coverage and
    to then pursue insured tortfeasors when, according to Security National, the
    clear intention of ss. 2(1)(b) and (c) of the Schedule is to provide the
    minimum level of coverage when no insurance is available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the language of ss. 2(1)(b) and (c) of the
    Schedule makes it clear that recovery under the uninsured coverage is an
    alternative to recovery under the insurance referred to in those sections. We
    repeat these sections for ease of reference.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. (1) The insurer shall not be liable to make any
    payment,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) where a person insured under the contract is
    entitled to recover money under any valid policy of insurance other than money
    payable on death, except for the difference between such entitlement and the
    relevant minimum limits determined under clause (a);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) where the person insured under the contract is
    entitled to recover money under the third party liability section of a motor
    vehicle liability policy. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An injured insured is entitled to pursue alternative
    claims against its own insurer and other potential joint tortfeasors in the
    same action: see <i>July v. Neal</i> (1986),
    57 O.R. (2d) 129 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    per Morden J.A. However, based on the language of ss. 2(1)(b) and (c) of the
    Schedule, judgment against the insurer on the uninsured coverage is not
    available where the insured recovers judgment against an insured joint
    tortfeasor. If an injured insured chooses to obtain judgment against his or her
    own insurer under the uninsured coverage in an action that does not include
    other potential joint tortfeasor(s), in our view, that choice signifies an
    election. It signifies that the insured has elected not to subsequently pursue
    a claim against the potential joint tortfeasor(s) to the extent that a judgment
    on the claim would have barred recovery under the uninsured coverage if brought
    in the same proceeding as the claim on the uninsured coverage. In these
    circumstances, in our view, any attempt to pursue such a claim would constitute
    an abuse of process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Fifth, the nature of the insurance regime in place under
    O.A.P. 1 also supports our interpretation. The post-November 1, 1996 insurance
    regime (Bill 59) provides statutory accident benefits as compensation for
    pecuniary losses. The regime permits accident victims to sue in tort for some
    pecuniary losses and non-pecuniary losses only where their injuries meet a high
    threshold <i>i.e.</i>, where the victim has
    died or has suffered permanent serious disfigurement or permanent serious
    impairment of an important bodily function caused by continuing injury which is
    physical in nature. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Given the high threshold, many claims will be for amounts
    well in excess of the $200,000 minimum coverage provided under s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>. Claimants with claims in
    excess of $200,000 are likely to sue insured potential joint tortfeasors if
    there is any reasonable prospect of success. If the claimant also sues his or
    her insurer under the uninsured provisions of the policy, the insurer will only
    be liable if the claimant does not recover against the insured potential joint
    tortfeasor. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>However, where the claim is for less than the $200,000
    minimum coverage provided under s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, we see no indication that it was the intention of
    the legislature to require insured claimants to pursue potentially costly and
    speculative litigation before seeking recovery against their insurer. On the
    other hand, depending on the facts of the case, claimants may choose to pursue
    an insured potential joint tortfeasor where the liability of an uninsured
    motorist is questionable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, we reject Security Nationals argument that the
    language of s.  5.7 of O.A.P.&nbsp;1
    supports its position. Section 5.7 of O.A.P. 1 states, in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. We will not pay:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>any amount, if you or other insured persons can
    make a valid claim under the liability section of a motor vehicle liability
    policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, s. 5.1 of O.A.P. 1 provides that [i]f there
    is a difference between the interpretation of the wording of [the uninsured
    coverage provisions of the policy] and the interpretation of the wording in the
    Schedule, the Schedule prevails. Even if the wording of the exclusion as set
    out in the policy might otherwise support Security Nationals position, s. 5.1 of
    O.A.P. 1 makes it clear that the Schedule prevails over the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seventh, we reject Security Nationals argument that
    the lack of remedies available to an uninsured coverage insurer against insured
    potential joint tortfeasors supports its interpretation. Even assuming that
    Security National is correct in saying that uninsured coverage insurers have no
    remedies against insured joint tortfeasors, the cost of providing uninsured
    coverage in such circumstances can be built into the cost of the insurance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we reject Security Nationals argument that
    various decisions make it clear that an injured party cannot recover from his
    or her insurer on the uninsured coverage when there is an insured joint
    tortfeasor. None of the decisions on which Security National relies address the
    situation of the injured insured failing to sue an insured admitted joint
    tortfeasor or an insured potential joint tortfeasor.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    Loftus commenced her action on May 21, 2003. Security National issued its third
    party claim on October 21, 2004. The Rule 22 motion is dated March 6, 2008.
    Whether the limitation period for Ms. Loftus to sue a third party is six months
    or two years, even assuming she did not discover her potential claim against
    the third parties until October 21, 2004, the limitation period has long since
    expired. </p>

    example, in <i>July v. Neal</i>, the issue
    was whether the limitation period for adding the unidentified driver coverage
    insurer to an existing action against uninsured potential joint tortfeasor had
    expired. This court held that the discoverability rule applied and that it
    would be for the trial judge to decide whether the limitation period had
    expired. <i>July v. Neal</i> did not involve
    a situation where the injured party failed to sue an insured potential joint
    tortfeasor.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Further, in <i>Barton
    v. Aitchison, </i>the issue was whether an injured party had to await the
    outcome of the liquidation of the insurer of the motorist who caused an
    accident before proceeding against his own insurer on the uninsured coverage.
    In holding that the predecessor to s. 2(1)(c) of the Schedule did not apply in
    that situation, this court made the following comments <i>in obiter</i> concerning the purpose of s. 2(1)(c) of the Schedule:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Counsel for the minister agrees
    that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Motions Court
    judge was in error in attributing to the word &quot;entitled&quot; the same
    meaning as &quot;collectible&quot;. He submits that cl. 3(1)(c) refers to the
    &quot;1%&quot; rule found in the <i>Motor
    Vehicle Accident Claims Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 298, such as where three or
    more vehicles are involved in an accident. He cites as an example, the
    plaintiff is in vehicle A; vehicle B is at fault but uninsured; vehicle C is at
    fault but insured. Clause 3(1)(c) has the effect of preventing the plaintiff
    from suing his own insurer under his uninsured automobile coverage just because
    vehicle B is uninsured. He must, because of cl. 3(1)(c), obtain his recovery
    from the third party liability insurer of vehicle C. Clause 1(d) standing alone
    would permit, in the above example, plaintiff A to recover against his own
    insurer under the uninsured motorist coverage, but the exclusion covered by cl.
    3(1)(c) prevents that from happening when one joint tortfeasor is insurer, even
    if the tortfeasor <i>is found </i>to be only
    one per cent to blame. We agree that this is the meaning and effect that must
    be given to that clause. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Significantly, this court was referring to a situation
    where the joint tortfeasor is found to blame. Accordingly, we do not
    interpret these comments as referring to a situation where the injured party
    fails to sue a potential tortfeasor. However, even if they do, as we have said,
    the comments were made <i>in obiter</i> and
    therefore do not constitute binding authority.</p>
