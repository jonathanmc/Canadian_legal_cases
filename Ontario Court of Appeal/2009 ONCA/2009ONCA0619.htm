    to GEA on March 17, 2004 (the “Final Offer”), FNG made several statements

    and purchase agreement (the “SPA”) regarding FNG’s purchase of the GEA

  <h2>(3)       The

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In October 2004, as a result of FNG’s failure to
    close the SPA transaction, GEA commenced arbitration proceedings pursuant to
    the SPA and under the rules of the German Institute for Arbitration (the
    “Arbitration”), in which it claimed damages against FNG in an amount in excess
    of <span style='"Times New Roman"'>€</span>210 million for
    alleged breach of contract.   FNG, in turn, counterclaimed against GEA for
    damages for breach of the SPA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Arbitration was divided into two phases: the
    liability phase and the damages phase.  On September 15, 2006, the arbitral tribunal ruled in favour of GEA on
    the issue of liability, holding that FNG had breached the SPA, and dismissed
    FNG’s counterclaim.  The tribunal held
    that GEA was entitled to damages in an amount that would put it in the position
    it would have enjoyed if FNG had fulfilled its obligations under the SPA.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>FNG thereafter applied to a German appellate
    court to vacate the tribunal’s liability decision.  The application was denied on the ground of
    prematurity since the quantum of GEA’s damages had yet to be determined.  Costs of the application were awarded to GEA in
    the amount of<span style='"Times New Roman"'> €</span>228,760.  FNG did not appeal this decision.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The damages phase of the Arbitration is now in
    progress.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Evidence
    of Alleged Fraud</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Khan testified during the liability phase of the
    Arbitration.  He said that: (i) Ventra
    has over $1 billion in sales; and (ii) Ventra is a sister corporation of FNG
    that is owned by him personally through a Nova Scotia LLC.  The latter assertion conflicted with FNG’s
    representation, in both the Indicative and Final Offers, that Ventra was a
    wholly-owned FNG subsidiary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On March 8, 2007, a settlement meeting took
    place in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    .  FNG was represented at this meeting by Graham
    and FNG’s German trial counsel, Thomas Weimann (“Weimann”).  GEA’s German trial counsel, Peter Heckel
    (“Heckel”) and Andreas von Oppen (“von Oppen”), also attended the meeting.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties dispute certain of the events that
    transpired at the March 8 meeting.  Heckel
    and von Oppen allege that during the meeting, Graham suggested to GEA’s
    representatives that: (i) GEA should consider a modest settlement of its claims
    against FNG since FNG, “with the help of a renowned US law firm”, had been
    restructured so as to make it difficult for GEA to seize its assets; and (ii)
    FNG’s enterprise value was only roughly “60 million”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Weimann and Graham strongly deny that Graham
    made the statements attributed to him by Heckel and von Oppen.  They also allege that the discussions at the
    March 8 meeting were confidential, a claim denied by Heckel and von Oppen.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties are also divided on what was said
    during a telephone conversation on January 30, 2008 between Heckel and
    Weimann.  Heckel claims that he called
    Weimann on that date to inquire whether FNG was going to pay the outstanding <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>€</span>228,760 costs award made
    in favour of GEA by the German appellate court.   Heckel maintains that Weimann
    replied that FNG was not going to pay the costs award and indicated in German
    that FNG was just “two sheds in the landscape”, suggesting that FNG had no
    substantial assets.  Weimann denies having
    made these statements.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the foregoing, GEA concluded that
    sometime after the December 2, 2003 Indicative Offer and before the January 30,
    2008 telephone discussion between Weimann and Heckel, FNG transferred all its assets
    to Khan or other unknown persons in an effort to become judgment proof, thereby
    making it impossible for GEA to collect its anticipated damages award in the
    Arbitration from FNG.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On July 7, 2008, about five months after Heckel
    and Weimann’s telephone conversation, GEA applied to the Superior Court of
    Justice in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario for <i>ex parte</i> relief in the nature of a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order against Ventra and Graham.  In its
    notice of application, GEA alleged that it required evidence from Ventra and
    Graham concerning “an apparent fraud being perpetuated [<i>sic</i>] by FNG to shield itself from a substantial claim asserted
    against it by GEA in [the Arbitration]”.  GEA claimed that the order sought would allow it “to determine the
    circumstances of and prosecute FNG’s wrongdoing in respect of its assets”, that
    Ventra and Graham were “the only practicable source of information available to
    GEA in order to investigate FNG’s fraud and determine its legal remedies”, and
    that the interests of justice favoured granting the relief sought.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of its application, GEA relied in
    part on an affidavit sworn on June 20, 2008 by GEA’s legal counsel in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    ,
    Torsten Kunz-Aue.  In that affidavit,
    Kunz-Aue outlined the nature of the wrongdoing alleged and the purpose of the
    relief sought by GEA:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3. The Norwich Pharmacal Order would provide GEA
    with an equitable right of discovery to obtain evidence from [Ventra] and…[Graham]
    relating to an apparent fraud being perpetuated [<i>sic</i>] by FNG and its principals to shield itself from any recovery
    by GEA.  As set forth below, substantial
    evidence exists that from October 2004 to present FNG has transferred assets to
    other persons or entities to attempt to make itself judgment proof.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>21. It is thus apparent that transfers of assets
    were made by FNG, including, apparently, the transfer of [Ventra] shares from
    FNG to a
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    FNG regarding its assets.  GEA argued that
    the interests of justice favoured allowing it to pursue pre-action discovery
    with respect to this “different, but equally blameworthy conduct by FNG”.  It also claimed that: </p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons, the motions judge expressed the
    view that, based on the evidential record, “one of two alternative possibilities
    must logically be the reality”:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[27]     The
    first possibility is that [Ventra] was in fact a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNG
    at the time of the SPA but later removed from FNG after the abortive closing
    through a restructuring by January, 2008 when GEA learned that FNG would not
    satisfy the costs award.  If this is true
    then GEA may have a cause of action against FNG, [Ventra] and [Khan] for a
    fraudulent conveyance to defeat GEA as a contingent creditor.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> [29]    The second possibility is that [Khan] and FNG
    misled GEA through intentional misrepresentations (as to [Ventra] being a
    subsidiary of FNG) into entering into the SPA in May 2, 2004, and that [Ventra]
    was a mere sister or affiliate corporation to FNG by that point in time, both
    being indirectly owned by [Khan].  Perhaps [Khan] caused FNG to transfer the shares of [Ventra] to a third
    party at some point after FNG acquired [Ventra] but prior to making the
    Indicative Offer to GEA.  If this is the
    situation then the evidence suggests [Khan] and FNG may have committed a fraud
    against GEA through the misrepresentations made to induce GEA to enter into the
    SPA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge continued: “With either
    possibility, the evidence suggests a possible fraud on the part of [Khan],
    indirectly the owner of both FNG and [Ventra], against GEA” (at para. 30).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the need for a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order, the motions judge held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[35]     The
    information sought through the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> Order
    in the situation at hand is necessary to determine whether an action exists in
    respect of [Ventra], to identify wrongdoers, to find and preserve evidence that
    may substantiate or support an action against wrongdoers and to trace and
    preserve assets.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[38]     The
    evidentiary record suggests that third parties (i.e. parties beyond FNG and Mr.
    Khan), being Mr. Graham and [Ventra] may be fraudulently involved in the
    transfer of assets from FNG or that Mr. Graham was a participant in fraudulent
    misrepresentations made to GEA. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[39]     [Ventra]
    and Mr. Graham are the only practicable source of information available to GEA
    in order to investigate and determine its legal remedies.  Mr. Graham is an officer and legal counsel of
    [Ventra].  He has said he is the trustee
    owner of the shares of the corporation that indirectly controls [Ventra].  The record indicates Mr. Graham has an
    intimate knowledge of the history of [Ventra] and its relationship to FNG.  [Ventra] and Mr. Graham are residents of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The corporate documents of [Ventra] and the
    financial statements over the period 2003 to 2006 would quite possibly in
    themselves provide the information sought.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[41]     The
    evidentiary record establishes that GEA quite possibly has suffered a loss
    because of the unlawful actions of one or more of FNG, Mr. Khan, Mr. Graham and
    [Ventra].  The objective of a
    <st1:City

    the 1974 decision of the House of Lords in <i>Norwich
    Pharmacal</i>, a case of suspected patent infringement.  <i>Norwich
    Pharmacal</i> holds that, in certain circumstances, an action for discovery may
    be allowed against an “involved” third party who has information that the
    claimant alleges would allow it to identify a wrongdoer, so as to enable the
    claimant to bring an action against the wrongdoer where the claimant would
    otherwise not be able to do so.  In a
    passage frequently quoted in subsequent authorities, Lord Reid described the
    basic principle at p. 175:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]f through no fault of his own a person gets mixed
    up in the tortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrong-doing he may
    incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty to assist the person who
    has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of
    the wrongdoers.  I do not think that it
    matters whether he became so mixed up by voluntary action on his part or
    because it was his duty to do what he did.  It may be that if this causes him expense the person seeking the
    information ought to reimburse him.  But
    justice requires that he should co-operate in righting the wrong if he
    unwittingly facilitated its perpetration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his concurring speech in <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> at p. 199, Lord Cross of Chelsea rejected the
    suggestion that the recognition of an action for discovery to permit disclosure
    of the names and addresses of alleged wrongdoers would open the door to meritless
    “fishing requests” by prospective plaintiffs who sought to collect evidence or
    information from persons who had no relevant connection with the person to be
    sued or the events at issue.  In so
    doing, he also identified the following factors as relevant to the
    determination of whether pre-action discovery of a third party should be
    allowed in the exercise of the court’s discretion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> the
    strength of the applicant’s case against the unknown alleged wrongdoer;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span> the
    relationship between the alleged wrongdoer and the respondent (the person from
    whom discovery is sought);</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>whether the information could be obtained from
    another source; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>whether the provision of the information “would
    put the respondent to trouble which could not be compensated by the payment of
    all expenses by the applicant”.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>See also, to substantially the same effect, the speech of Lord
    Kilbrandon in <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i>, at

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Norwich
    Pharmacal</i>, pre-action discovery was sought for a narrow purpose – to
    identify suspected wrongdoers where it was known that a wrong had occurred, in
    order to permit the injured parties to sue for redress.  To achieve this focused objective, discovery
    was allowed against an “innocent” third party against whom the appellants had
    no direct cause of action.</p>

    against the respondent from whom discovery was sought was asserted on the basis
    of the respondent’s own alleged wrongdoing (see <i>British Steel Corpn. v. Granada Television Ltd.</i>, [1981] A.C. 1096 (H.L.)),
    as well as where the object of the relief was to permit the tracing and

    at para. 44 that the “

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>New situations are inevitably going to arise where

    respondent who is “likely to be a party to subsequent proceedings” under
    certain circumstances in order to: “(i) dispose fairly of the anticipated
    proceedings; (ii) assist the dispute to be resolved without proceedings; or
    (iii) save costs”.    Further, under Rule 31.17, an order for
    disclosure by a person who is not a party to proceedings may be made by a court
    where: “(a) the documents of which disclosure is sought are likely to support
    the case of the applicant or adversely affect the case of one of the other

    461 that there are two threshold requirements for obtaining the discretionary
    remedy of an equitable bill of discovery: (i) the applicant must have a <i>bona fide</i> claim against the alleged
    wrongdoers; and (ii) the applicant must share some sort of relationship with
    the respondents.  Justice Stone explained
    that the first requirement is intended to ensure “that actions for a bill of
    discovery are not brought frivolously or without any justification”, while the
    second requirement reflects the principle that “a bill of discovery may not be
    issued against a mere witness or disinterested bystander to the alleged
    misconduct”.  Justice Stone then
    identified two additional requirements for granting a bill of discovery: (iii)
    the person from whom discovery is sought must be the only practicable source of
    information available to the applicant; and (iv) the public interests both in
    favour and against disclosure must be taken into account.</p>

    standard of review applicable on appeal from the motions judge’s December Order.  FNG, supported by Ventra and Graham on
    slightly different grounds, argues that the motions judge erred in his
    appreciation and application of the test for a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order.  It therefore contends that the standard

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In contrast, GEA maintains that as these appeals
    involve appellate scrutiny of a discretionary and equitable order, and as the
    December Order involved the application of a legal standard to a set of facts,
    the operative standard of review is palpable and over-riding error.  GEA contends that the motions judge’s decision
    is unassailable on this standard.  Alternatively, GEA asserts that if the applicable standard of review is
    that of correctness, the motions judge’s decision is correct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The recent decision of the Alberta Court of
    Appeal in <i>B. (A.) v. D. (C.)</i> (2008),
    429 A.R. 89 is instructive on this issue.  In <i>B.(A.)</i>, on appeal from an <i>ex parte </i>decision of a chambers judge denying
    a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order, the appellant argued that the appeal was a <i>de novo</i> hearing, thus triggering the correctness standard of
    review.  Alternatively, if the hearing
    was not <i>de novo</i>, the standard of
    review for pure questions of law was correctness, and for errors of mixed fact
    and law, palpable and overriding error.  In respect of these submissions, the Alberta Court of Appeal indicated at
    para. 10:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Orders involving the exercise of judicial
    discretion, such as whether the interests of justice warrant the granting of a
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order, are generally evaluated on a standard of reasonableness.  Absent a material error in principle, a
    significant misapprehension or disregard of the evidence, or a decision which
    is clearly wrong, an appellate court will not interfere with an exercise of
    discretion…In assessing whether a decision is clearly wrong, an error in the
    interpretation or application of the law to found facts will attract appellate
    review.  A decision though discretionary
    will be clearly wrong when it involves an erroneous interpretation of the
    law.  In other words, where the exercise
    of discretion rests first on pre-conditions to the exercise of the discretion
    which themselves involve points of law, the standard of review of the Chambers
    Judge’s conclusions on those points of law is correctness.  That is what the appellant asserts occurred
    here.  However, an appeal court will not
    interfere merely because it would have exercised the discretion
    differently.  [Citations omitted.]</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As I observed in <i>R.
    v. Regan</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, 2002 SCC 12, however, discretionary
    decisions are not completely insulated from review (para. 118).  An appellate court may and should intervene
    where it finds that the trial judge has misdirected himself as to the
    applicable law or made a palpable error in his assessment of the facts.  As this Court held in <i>Pelech v. Pelech</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 801, at pp. 814-15, <i>the criteria for the exercise of a judicial
    discretion are legal criteria, and their definition as well as a failure to
    apply them or a misapplication of them raise questions of law which are subject
    to appellate review</i>.  [Emphasis

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order is not a novel proposition.  It appears to have been a fundamental element
    of a bill of discovery in equity from the infancy of that remedy.  In <i>Norwich
    Pharmacal</i> at p. 205, when discussing the nature of the equitable remedy of
    pre-action discovery, Lord Kilbrandon cited the following passage in <i>Colonial Government v. Tatham</i> (1902), 23
    Natal L.R. 153 at p. 158:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The principle which underlies the jurisdiction which
    the law gives to the courts of equity in cases of this nature, is that <i>where discovery is absolutely necessary in
    order to enable a party to proceed with a bona fide claim, it is the duty of
    the court to assist</i> <i>with the
    administration of justice by granting an order for discovery</i>, unless some
    well-founded objection exists against the exercise of such jurisdiction.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    underscore
    the importance of a showing of necessity in order to invoke extraordinary
    equitable relief in the nature of a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order.  In <i>Norwich
    Pharmacal</i>, the court emphasized that if the information sought (the
    identities and addresses of the wrongdoers) was not made available, no action
    could ever be brought: see for example, the comments of Lord Reid at p.
    174.  In <i>Ashworth</i>, at para. 36, Lord Woolf C.J. explained the <i>“

    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]his is a discretionary jurisdiction which enables

    where the claimant requires disclosure of “crucial” or “vital” information in
    order to be able to bring its claim or where the claimant “requires a missing
    piece of the jigsaw”.  In light,
    particularly, of the pre-action discovery provisions of the rules of court in
    <st1:country-region

    , above described, these cases hold that
    a
    <st1:City w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This restrictive approach to the availability of
    a <i>Norwich</i> order was subsequently rejected
    in <i>R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign
    and Commonwealth Affairs</i>, [2008] EWHC 2048 (Admin.).  In that case, the court stated at para. 94:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The intrusion into the business of others which the
    exercise of the <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> jurisdiction obviously entails means that a court should not, as Lord Woolf in <i>Ashworth</i> made clear, require such
    information to be provided unless it is necessary.  <i>But in
    our view, there is nothing in any authority which justifies a more stringent
    requirement than necessity by elevating the test to the information being a

style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The requirement of necessity also finds some
    support in the applicable Canadian authorities.  In <i>B.(A.), supra</i>, at para. 16,
    the Alberta Court of Appeal referred to <i>Ashworth</i> as an example of a case in which “[t]he investigative capacity of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> orders was applied…in circumstances of necessity, sufficiency of grounds and
    proportionality”.  In the view of the
    Alberta Court of Appeal, these were “legitimate concerns” to be taken into
    account in determining whether to grant
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> relief.  In the result, the applicant’s
    failure in <i>B.(A.)</i> to demonstrate that
    the information sought would not be available in the normal discovery process
    was fatal to the application for a
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On my reading of the authorities in Canada and
    England, it is unclear whether the requirement of a showing of necessity for
    pre-action discovery properly forms part of the court’s inquiry as to whether
    the third party from whom discovery is sought is the only practicable source of
    the information available (as held in <i>Mitsui</i> at para. 24) or as to whether the interests of justice favour disclosure or
    non-disclosure (as argued by FNG before this court).  However, there is no suggestion in the
    established jurisprudence that it is a stand-alone requirement for the granting
    of a
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    important point is that a

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order
    is an equitable, discretionary and flexible remedy.  It is also an intrusive and extraordinary
    remedy that must be exercised with caution.  It is therefore incumbent on the applicant for a <i>Norwich</i> order to demonstrate that the discovery sought is required
    to permit a prospective action to proceed, although the firm commitment to
    commence proceedings is not itself a condition precedent to this form of
    equitable relief. </p>

    a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order “must be required to plead a case”.  FNG emphasizes Sharpe J.A.’s comment at para. 7 of <i>Meuwissen</i> that: “[t]he motions judge did not find that pre-action

    infringed.  But in <i>P. v. T.</i>, the applicant obtained an order for pre-action discovery
    in circumstances where he was uncertain whether a tort had been committed so as
    to give rise to a cause of action.  Similarly,
    in <i>Straka</i>, the appellant did not know
    whether he had a cause of action against the respondents.  The appellant therefore sought to determine
    what facts could have given rise to the wrongdoing alleged “so that he might
    take steps to clear his name through legal proceedings <i>if this should prove necessary</i>” (at para. 52) (emphasis added).  And in <i>Isofoton</i>,
    pre-action discovery was ordered where its purposes included the obtaining of
    information required to determine whether a legal proceeding was appropriate (see,
    in particular, paras. 47, 50 and 59).  See also <i>Leahy</i> (Q.B.), at
    para. 106.</p>

    information in the possession of the respondents at the time of the application
    was sufficient to permit them to formulate and plead their case (at para.
    9).  That does not mean, however, that

    <st1:City w:st="on">

    an exceptional, though flexible, equitable remedy.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge concluded that a

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order was “necessary” on four grounds.  For convenience, I repeat what he said at paragraph 35 of his reasons: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The information sought through the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    required by GEA to investigate whether it had a cause of action against Ventra.  But this suggested objective of a
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order
    went beyond the four corners of the relief sought by GEA and lay outside the
    objects of the requested

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> Order nor in its November 2008

    a ground for the equitable relief that it sought.  Nor did it suggest that one of the purposes
    of the requested
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    investigation of whether it had a potential actionable claim against Ventra or

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GEA’s notice of application instead focused on
    alleged fraudulent conveyances by FNG and the investigation of “FNG’s
    fraud”.  GEA claimed that a
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order would allow it “to determine the circumstances of and prosecute FNG’s
    wrongdoing in respect of its assets”.  Similarly, in its notice of motion for variation of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> Order, GEA maintained that the discovery sought would enable it “to assess its
    legal remedies against FNG and/or its principals or employees and initiate
    proceedings as against them”.  There was
    no suggestion of a potential claim as against Ventra or, indeed, as against
    Graham.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet nowhere in his reasons does the motions
    judge assess whether a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order
    was required to permit GEA to pursue its rights against FNG, including to
    permit GEA to plead its case against FNG, the alleged wrongdoer.  By failing to consider this question, the
    motions judge misdirected himself and failed to undertake a key aspect of the
    requisite necessity inquiry.  With respect,
    this was reversible error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my opinion, a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order was not needed for GEA to pursue its rights against FNG.  On the materials before the motions judge, two
    potential types of fraud by FNG and/or Khan were identified: fraudulent conveyances
    and fraudulent misrep-resentations.  Many
    of the critical facts necessary to advance such causes of action were in GEA’s
    possession, at the latest, following the January 30, 2008 telephone call
    between Heckel and Weimann.  By that time,
    GEA knew of: (i) FNG’s statements in the Indicative and Final Offers concerning
    its assets and financial position; (ii) Khan’s admissions under oath regarding
    the real ownership of Ventra; (iii) Graham’s alleged statements about FNG’s
    enterprise value; and (iv) Weimann’s alleged statements concerning FNG’s worth
    and asset position.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This information was sufficient to support GEA’s
    assertion that a potential fraud or frauds had been perpetrated on it by FNG
    and/or Khan.  While full particulars of
    the mechanics of the potential fraud or frauds were unknown to GEA, the nature,
    timing and apparent purpose of the frauds were known, as was the identity of
    the suspected wrongdoer or wrongdoers.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, GEA was positioned to formulate a pleading against FNG (and/or
    Khan) if it elected to do so.  If an action
    had been commenced, discovery of the circumstances of the alleged frauds would
    be available to GEA under the normal discovery practice mandated by the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  Further, once an action was initiated, information
    from Ventra and Graham regarding the asserted frauds would be available to GEA
    under the rules in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  If that information warranted an action
    against Ventra and/or Graham, a motion for the necessary pleadings amendment
    could be brought.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note that in his June 20, 2008 affidavit, Kunz-Aue acknowledged that “substantial
    evidence” existed concerning FNG’s alleged fraudulent conveyances.   Further,
    Khan’s admissions under oath, Graham’s alleged statements to Heckel and von
    Oppen in March 2007, and Weimann’s alleged comments in January 2008, provided a
    foundation for GEA’s assertion of fraudulent misrepresentations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also agree with the appellants that the fresh evidence regarding the civil proceedings
    commenced by GEA in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Illinois strongly
    undercuts GEA’s suggestion that pre-action discovery in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario from Ventra and Graham is required in
    order for GEA to determine and address its legal remedies against FNG and/or
    Khan.  The fresh evidence, which I regard
    as relevant and admissible under the principles outlined in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 and <i>Sengmueller v. Sengmueller</i> (1994), 17
    O.R. (3d) 208 (C.A.), supports the claim that GEA was positioned at the time of
    the motions before the motions judge to commence proceedings against FNG and/or
    Khan if so advised.  It also suggests
    that GEA now has access to wide-ranging discovery rights against FNG and Khan
    in the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Illinois.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its complaint filed in the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Illinois
    court, GEA stated at paragraph 6:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This case involves alternative theories of
    liability…At this time, GEA does not know which of these two theories of
    liability will prove to be the correct theory [fraudulent conveyances or
    fraudulent misrepresentations], <i>but both
    theories are actionable and are supported by representations made and/or
    conduct undertaken by or on behalf of Khan and FNG.</i>  [Emphasis added.]<u></u></p>
  <p class=ParaNo>These allegations mirror those advanced by GEA against FNG and
    Khan in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    reiterate that pre-action discovery is rare and extraordinary discretionary
    relief.  It is not intended nor should it
    be permitted to serve as a substitute for the normal discovery regime mandated
    by the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  As noted by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>B.(A.), supra</i>, at para. 16: “[a]
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order is not intended as a device to circumvent the normal discovery process
    which can effectively achieve the same result.”  I agree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    recognize that GEA did not seek pre-action discovery merely to plead.  GEA’s counsel responsibly acknowledged during
    oral argument that GEA was “not very far away” from being able to plead one or
    more causes of action arising from FNG’s  alleged wrongdoing.  In fact, this understates the situation.  As in <i>Meuwissen</i>,
    GEA has ample information in hand to formulate and plead its case. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> relief
    is not available simply to assist GEA in perfecting its prospective pleading or
    to obtain further evidence to aid in proving the facts of the two potential
    frauds already identified.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also do not accept GEA’s claim that it should be afforded pre-action discovery
    to ascertain whether FNG or its agents engaged in a third, as yet unknown
    fraud.  The suggestion of a third cause
    of action in fraud is speculative.  To
    grant a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order for this purpose would
    countenance an overt ‘fishing expedition’.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do I agree that the other grounds identified by the motions judge warrant a
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a case, like <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i>,
    where such relief is necessary to identify the suspected wrongdoer.  GEA’s claims arise from FNG’s breach of the
    SPA and its alleged subsequent actions to defeat GEA’s legitimate interests as
    an anticipated creditor in the Arbitration and as a creditor in respect of the
    outstanding costs award made in GEA’s favour by the German appellate court.  The identity of the principal alleged
    wrongdoer – FNG – is known.  An action
    against it and its agents is already available to GEA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    I am not persuaded that a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order
    is necessary to preserve evidence.  There
    is no indication on this record of the risk of potential destruction of
    relevant evidence by any of the appellants or by Khan in the absence of a
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> order or that such destruction has already occurred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor,
    in my opinion, is this a tracing case.  On the record before this court and the motions judge, GEA has no
    existing proprietary or personal claim or other beneficial entitlement to assets
    formerly or at present in the possession of any of the appellants or, indeed,
    Khan.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  This case is therefore factually
    distinguishable from the tracing cases relied on by GEA.  At most, GEA is an unpaid and unsecured creditor
    of FNG in respect of its outstanding costs award and a prospective unsecured creditor
    of FNG in relation to unquantified damages to be awarded in phase two of the
    Arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GEA
    did not argue before this court that pre-action discovery is required in this
    case in aid of a Mareva injunction or an Anton Piller order.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Moreover, in contrast to other cases in which <i>Norwich</i> orders have been sought or
    obtained, in this case the alleged wrongdoer (FNG) eventually received notice
    of the <i>Norwich</i> application and
    participated in the <i>Norwich</i> proceeding.  Further, Ventra and Graham
    are closely connected both to FNG and the wrongdoings alleged by GEA.  In that important respect, they are “involved”
    but scarcely “innocent” third parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    therefore conclude that GEA failed to establish that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> relief is required in this case.  On this
    ground alone, the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> Order cannot stand.  It is therefore unnecessary to address the
    appellants’ remaining grounds of attack on the

    <i>Norwich</i> Order.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Appellant’s
    Challenge to the September Order</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    remains to consider the appellants’ challenge to the impugned conditions of the
    September Order.  For three reasons, I
    would reject that challenge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    on the record before this court, Ventra and Graham did not appeal the September
    Order, although they sought relief concerning it on these appeals. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the September Order was granted on the consent of GEA.  The reasons of C. Campbell J. indicate that
    the conditions imposed were suggested by GEA in its factum on the appellants’ motions.  Thus, the relief obtained was based on a
    compromise by GEA that accrued to the direct benefit of Ventra and Graham and,
    by virtue of the disclosure authorized by the September Order, ultimately to
    FNG’s benefit as well.  Fairness
    therefore dictates that the appellants should not lightly be permitted to
    disturb the foundation on which GEA’s consent was forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    only Ventra and Graham attack the condition in paragraph 1(b) of the September Order,
    while all the appellants challenge the immunity from suit condition contained in
    paragraph 1(c).  I see nothing
    objectionable in the former condition.  In respect of the latter condition, the record reveals that FNG has a
    history of commencing proceedings in relation to the alleged violation of the
    confidentiality of the Arbitration.  The immunity
    from suit provision of the September Order was designed to foreclose a similar
    lawsuit by FNG arising from the disclosure in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Norwich</i> proceeding of the facts and the issues in the Arbitration.   This was a reasonable precaution in the circumstances
    and I see no basis to interfere with it. </p>
  <h2>IV.       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would therefore allow the appeals in part by setting aside the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    <i>Norwich</i> Order.  I would award FNG the costs of
