  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent,
    a member of the Toronto Police Service, on charges of assault, attempt to
    obstruct justice and perjury.  These
    offences arose out of a demonstration by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty
    (“OCAP”) in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    in November 2003.  Police officers were
    attempting to prevent members of OCAP and their sympathizers from occupying a
    vacant building.  The Crown alleged that
    the respondent unlawfully assaulted one of the demonstrators, Alex Levant, and
    then created a false record of the events in his memo book to cover up the
    assault. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant
    was charged with assaulting the respondent as well as assaulting and
    obstructing another police officer.  The
    Crown alleged that the respondent then perjured himself at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant’s
    trial.  The incident involving the
    respondent and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant was captured on
    videotape by an independent third person.  The videotape appeared to show the respondent punching and then
    arresting
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant for no reason.  When Levant’s defence counsel disclosed the
    videotape in the course of his trial, the prosecution dropped the charges
    against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant.  Sometime later, the Crown charged the
    respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was tried by Newbould J. and a
    jury.  The principal grounds of appeal
    concern the jury selection procedure.  The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the
    respondent to challenge potential jurors for cause based on their affiliation
    with OCAP.  The Crown also submits that
    the challenge for cause process itself was flawed.  In the result, says the Crown, the jury was
    improperly constituted resulting in serious jurisdictional errors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s principal grounds of appeal concern the
    jury selection process.  I will set out
    below in greater detail the circumstances of the jury selection.  In short, the appellant submits that the
    defence failed to make out a case for challenge for cause; was permitted to ask
    improper questions as part of the challenge for cause; and the procedure adopted
    by the trial judge improperly deprived the triers of their role in determining
    the truth of the challenge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred
    in refusing to allow Crown counsel at trial to rely on a theory that the
    respondent was guilty of assault because he used excessive force.  Finally, the appellant submits that defence
    counsel’s jury address was inflammatory and improper.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The OCAP Demonstration</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 8, 2003, the complainant, Alex Levant,
    joined in a demonstration organized by OCAP at an abandoned house on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Gerrard St. in the
    City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  OCAP intended, if possible, to occupy the
    house as part of a campaign against homelessness.  A number of uniformed police officers,
    including officers of the bicycle unit, were assigned to prevent the
    demonstrators from illegally occupying the house.  The respondent was a member of the bicycle
    unit.  The officers used their bicycles
    to form a barrier and then stood behind the barrier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just before the incident, the demonstrators were
    attempting to force their way past the police officers.  Many of the officers were using their
    bicycles to push the demonstrators back.  The respondent, however, stepped over his bicycle and pushed
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Levant, who was carrying a flagpole. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant in turn
    put his hand on the respondent’s shoulder.  The respondent turned and punched
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant
    in the head and took him to the ground where he was held and handcuffed by a
    number of officers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant was arrested
    and taken to the police station, where he was charged with assaulting the
    respondent as well as assaulting and obstructing another officer, Constable
    Melanie Mathieu.  The respondent recorded
    his version of the incident in his police memo book.  According to the respondent, he saw Mathieu
    attempting to arrest a female.  He saw a
    male (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant) grab Mathieu and pull her
    back.  The respondent therefore went to
    arrest the male who turned around and punched him.  The respondent punched the male, took him to
    the ground and advised him he was under arrest.  The male resisted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant’s trial for the
    charges of assault police and obstructing police took place on September 23 and
    24, 2004.  The respondent was a Crown
    witness and he testified in a manner consistent with the notes in his memo
    book.  During a break in the proceedings
    while the respondent was being cross-examined, counsel for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant
    disclosed the existence of a videotape to counsel for the prosecution.  This videotape had been made by a film
    student who had no association with OCAP or the police.  The videotape appeared to be inconsistent
    with the respondent’s version of events.  As a result, Crown counsel asked that the charges against
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Levant be withdrawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent testified at his own trial.  He maintained that he saw Mathieu step
    forward to arrest a female demonstrator.  He saw a male grab Mathieu by the right shoulder and yank it.  He explained that he stepped over the line of
    bicycles because he thought Mathieu was in a hostile crowd and in need of
    assistance. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant
    blocked his way, and so the respondent grabbed him by the left side. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant
    turned around and punched him in the chest.  The respondent then swung at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant to
    distract him. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant
    started running and so the respondent chased him, took him to the ground,
    handcuffed him and placed him under arrest.  The respondent testified that he punched Levant because he thought that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Levant had assaulted both Mathieu and himself and
    interfered with Mathieu’s arrest of the female demonstrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent had suffered an injury about a year
    before this incident.  As a result of the
    injury, when his left hand was up and his right hand pulled back, he felt a
    sharp pain in the chest.  He testified
    that when
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant pushed his right arm, he felt
    a pain in his chest that felt like he had been punched in the chest.  He felt that he had to punch
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Levant immediately to distract him.  His training taught him to act swiftly,
    decisively and with greater force than had just been applied to him to gain
    control in such circumstances.  After
    viewing the videotape, the respondent agreed that he had been mistaken in his
    belief that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant had punched him and pulled
    Mathieu.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent testified that he believed what he wrote
    in his memo book was true and that his evidence at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant’s
    trial, given without the aid of the videotape, was also true.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Jury Selection</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)       <i>The Basis for the
    Challenge for Cause</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence sought to challenge prospective jurors for
    cause based on potential partiality relating to their connection to OCAP and to
    pre-trial publicity.  In support of the
    application, the defence filed various media accounts and materials from the
    Internet.  The materials were of two
    kinds.  One set of materials showed
    pre-trial publicity about the respondent’s case, including reference to some
    evidence that the trial judge had ruled to be inadmissible, and opinions from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Levant’s criminal and civil counsel characterizing the
    respondent as being extremely dishonest and involved in a serious abuse of
    police power.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other materials related to OCAP and CUPE Local 3903.  These materials included articles written by
    members of and people associated with OCAP, and appeared to demonstrate that
    OCAP members advocated unlawful action and confrontation with the police, as
    well as what the defence alleged was a hatred of the police.  The materials also showed that CUPE Local
    3903 had established a “flying squad” that would participate in various
    demonstrations, including demonstrations by OCAP. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant was a
    member of CUPE Local 3903.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel at trial did not file any materials on
    the challenge for cause issue.  With
    respect to the pre-trial publicity, she submitted that the articles relied upon
    were dated, the most recent having been published two years earlier.  With respect to OCAP and CUPE Local 3903, Crown
    counsel submitted that there was no basis for a challenge for cause because the
    defence could not demonstrate bias within the community at large, and it was
    not sufficient to demonstrate anti-police bias in some members of OCAP or CUPE
    Local 3903.  Further, even if the defence
    could show widespread bias, it had to show that people with those views would
    not be able to decide the case fairly by setting aside those views.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed challenge for cause questions were as

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the trial judge ruled that the defence would be
    entitled to challenge potential jurors for cause on the basis of their
    relationship to OCAP, Crown counsel asked the trial judge to pre-screen jurors under
    s. 632 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> by asking them whether they had any family
    members who are police officers or who work with the police service.  She later narrowed that submission to anyone
    with an immediate family member who is a member of the Toronto Police Service.  Then, just at the conclusion of her
    submissions, Crown counsel suggested that the question could become part of the
    challenge for cause, although she maintained it could be done under s.
    632.  Defence counsel objected to the
    Crown request on the basis that it could not properly be part of pre-screening
    and there was no material to support a challenge for cause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ruled that the questions proposed by
    the Crown could not be posed by way of pre-screening.  He did not expressly rule on whether the
    questions could be asked as part of the challenge for cause.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)       <i>The
    Challenge for Cause Procedure</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just before the jury selection was to begin, the trial
    judge said the following to defence counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am assuming if the answer to the first three
    questions is no there is nothing for the triers to decide, correct?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel agreed and Crown counsel did not raise
    any objection.  When the first potential
    juror was challenged for cause, he answered “no” to the first three
    questions.  At this point the trial judge
    interjected as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  There
    will be no decision to make, triers, because it is only if the answer is yes,
    then there would be two more questions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE REGISTRAR:  Triers, have you reached your decision?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  There
    is no decision for the triers.  <i>We
    have agreed</i>, Mr. Registrar, unless there is a yes answer to the first
    questions, the triers will not have to make a decision. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel again did not raise any objection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each challenge for cause proceeded in accordance with
    the procedure outlined above.  Defence
    counsel challenged the prospective jurors for cause by asking the first three
    questions.  All of the first 14
    prospective jurors answered “no” to the first three questions, and therefore
    the triers were not called upon to make a decision.  Of the 14, the defence used peremptory challenges
    on five jurors, Crown counsel used two of hers, and seven jurors were
    sworn.  The 15<sup>th</sup> prospective
    juror, in response to the question about financial support to OCAP, said the
    following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I know I haven’t.  I don’t know that my wife has.  She contributes to things like Daily Food Bank and the likes.  I am not 100 percent sure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prospective juror answered “no” to the other two
    questions.  The trial judge and the
    parties obviously interpreted the prospective juror’s answer to the financial
    support question as a “no”, since the other questions were not put to the
    juror.  The defence used one of their
    peremptory challenges on this juror.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prospective juror number 16 became the eighth
    juror.  Prospective juror 17 answered
    that it was possible that her daughter had provided financial support to OCAP or
    may have participated in a demonstration with OCAP as “she is into things like
    that”.  In the result, the other
    questions were put to this juror.  The
    triers found her to be acceptable.  Defence
    counsel used another of his peremptory challenges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remainder of the jury selection process proceeded
    uneventfully.  All the remaining
    prospective jurors answered “no” to the first three questions.  Defence counsel used four more of his
    peremptory challenges.  The 25<sup>th</sup> potential juror became the 12<sup>th</sup> juror.  However, the following day, two jurors sent
    notes to the trial judge which led the trial judge and the parties to agree
    they should be excused.  Since no
    evidence had yet been heard, the jury selection process continued.  The next two prospective jurors answered “no”
    to the first three questions.  They
    became the last two jurors.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Jury Selection</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown alleges five different errors concerning the
    jury selection and the challenge for cause, and claims that the overall impact
    of these errors necessitates a new trial.  First, the Crown submits that the defence failed to make out a case for
    challenge for cause.  Second, the content
    of the questions was improper, as they were overbroad, asymmetrically failed to
    consider possible bias in favour of the police, and constituted an
    impermissible inquiry into the political opinions and beliefs of potential
    jurors and their family members.  Third,
    the challenge process provided information to defence counsel, which he then
    used in exercising his peremptory challenges.  Fourth, since the questions only referred to OCAP, the challenge for
    cause process improperly cast doubt or suspicion on OCAP and its supporters,
    including the complainant,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Levant, which began
    a process of demonizing OCAP and its supporters.  Fifth, the challenge for cause process
    adopted by the trial judge stripped the triers of their role in determining the
    acceptability of potential jurors.  I
    will deal with each of these arguments in turn.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)<i>       Was
    there a basis for Challenge for Cause?</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the defence failed to
    demonstrate the existence of a widespread bias that raised a realistic
    potential for partial juror behaviour.  Without any evidence, it was not open to the trial judge to assume that
    the jury pool included individuals harbouring such bias.  Alternatively, the Crown submits that even if
    there was widespread bias, the defence failed to show that jurors would be
    unable to set aside their bias and render a true verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Find</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 32,
    McLachlin C.J. explained that s. 638(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which
    permits challenges for cause on the basis of a lack of indifference,
    “generally” requires satisfying the court on two matters:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) that a widespread bias exists in the community;
    and (2) that some jurors may be incapable of setting aside this bias, despite
    trial safeguards, to render an impartial decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two components are directed to the question whether
    there exists a “realistic potential for partial juror behaviour”: <i>Find </i>at para. 33.  The first component, referred to in <i>Find</i> as the attitudinal component, is concerned with the existence of a material
    bias, that is, a bias that is relevant to the particular case.  As it was put in <i>Find</i>, at para. 36:  “What must be shown is a bias that could, as
    a matter of logic and experience, incline a juror to a certain party or
    conclusion in a manner that is unfair.”  At
    para. 37, McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. gave as examples bias that may flow from a
    personal interest in the matter to be tried, prejudice arising from prior
    exposure to the case, and prejudice against members of the accused’s social or
    racial group.  This component involves
    two elements: the existence of a material bias, and the question whether it is
    widespread. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, while the defence material might have been
    more comprehensive, it did establish a basis upon which the trial judge could
    find as a matter of logic and experience that a bias existed, at least in
    members of OCAP.  The material showed
    that OCAP advocated unlawful action, confrontation with the police and hatred
    of the police.  The Crown adduced no
    evidence to show that the defence material portrayed OCAP in a false light or
    misrepresented the aims of the organization.  Given the specific issues in the case, especially the use of force by
    the police to prevent allegedly illegal action by the OCAP demonstrators, the
    element of material bias was made out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second element of the attitudinal component is that
    the material bias be widespread.  McLachlin C.J. explained this element at para. 39 of <i>Find</i> in
    these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The second concept, &quot;widespread&quot;, relates
    to the prevalence or incidence of the bias in question. <i>Generally speaking</i>, the alleged bias must be established as
    sufficiently pervasive in the community to raise the possibility that it may be
    harboured by one or more members of a representative jury pool (although, in
    exceptional circumstances, a less prevalent bias may suffice, provided it
    raises a realistic potential of juror partiality: <i>Williams, supra</i>, at
    para. 43). If only a few individuals in the community hold the alleged bias,
    the chances of this bias tainting the jury process are negligible. For this
    reason, a <i>court must generally be
    satisfied</i> that the alleged bias is widespread in the community before a
    right to challenge for cause may flow. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this excerpt from <i>Find</i> demonstrates,
    McLachlin C.J. was at pains to point out that proof that the bias is widespread
    is generally required, and there may be exceptional circumstances where
    something less will suffice.  The passage
    from <i>R. v. Williams</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128, referenced by McLachlin C.J.,
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I add this. To say that widespread racial prejudice
    in the community can suffice to establish the right to challenge for cause in
    many cases is not to rule out the possibility that prejudice less than
    widespread might in some circumstances meet the <i>Sherratt</i> test. The
    ultimate question in each case is whether the <i>Sherratt</i> standard of a
    realistic potential for partiality is established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to the question of whether
    the material bias was widespread.  He
    referred to para. 39 of <i>Find</i> and para. 43 of <i>Williams</i> and
    concluded that there were exceptional circumstances in this case, “or at least
    there is such a doubt raised that it is better to err on the side of caution
    and permit the challenge regarding membership in or support of O.C.A.P.”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge did not explicitly identify the
    exceptional circumstances, it seems to me that the record supports such a
    finding.  This was an exceptional case in
    the sense that offences alleged against the respondent arose out of an unusual
    context.  On the material filed, OCAP
    members supported some unusual beliefs, beliefs that are arguably inconsistent
    with the rule of law.  The respondent was
    charged as a result of actions he claimed to have taken to uphold the law.  Because of the large pool of potential jurors
    in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto,
    it was unlikely that anyone who was a member of OCAP or supported its goals was
    in this particular jury array.  However,
    if there was such a person, there was a realistic potential that he or she
    could poison the process, given the nature of the beliefs held by OCAP members
    and the particular issues in this case.  I pause to add that I should not be taken as accepting that this is an
    accurate picture of OCAP or its members.  However, this was the record presented to the trial judge and, as I have
    said, the Crown adduced no evidence to undermine its accuracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second component of the challenge for cause test is
    referred to as the behavioural component of partiality.  This component asks whether some jurors will
    be unable to set aside their bias despite the cleansing effect of the trial
    process.  However, as McLachlin C.J.
    points out at para. 33 of <i>Find</i>, the
    attitudinal and behavioural components are not watertight compartments.  Rather, they serve as “guidelines for
    determining whether, on the record before the court, a realistic possibility
    exists that some jurors may decide the case on the basis of preconceived
    attitudes or beliefs, rather than the evidence placed before them.”  For many of the same reasons that the trial
    judge could find that the attitudinal component was made out, it was open to
    the judge to find that the behavioural component was made out.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge could reasonably infer that supporters
    of OCAP would have stereotypical attitudes about the police that would be
    highly resistant to trial safeguards.  The Crown submits that the defence adduced no evidence that supporters
    of OCAP could not be true to their oath.  However, the behavioural component may be “a matter of proof, judicial
    notice or simply reasonable inference as to how bias might influence the
    decision-making process”: <i>Find</i> at para. 47.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it must be remembered that the decision of
    whether to allow a challenge for cause is an exercise of discretion.  In <i>Find</i> at para. 45, McLachlin C.J. held
    that if the trial judge is in doubt, “the judge should err on the side of permitting
    challenges.  Since the right of the
    accused to a fair trial is at stake, ‘[i]t is better to risk allowing what are
    in fact unnecessary challenges, than to risk prohibiting challenges which are
    necessary’: <i>Williams, supra, </i>at para. 22”.  In my view, the trial judge did not err.  He was well aware of the record, had the
    benefit of extensive submissions from counsel, and applied the proper
    test.  I have not been persuaded that
    this court should interfere with his exercise of discretion.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)<i>       Overbreadth,
    asymmetry and impermissible inquiry into political beliefs</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that even if the trial judge did not
    err in permitting the defence to challenge for cause, the questions defence
    counsel were allowed to ask were too broad and represented an impermissible
    inquiry into the political opinions and beliefs of the jurors.  The Crown also points out that there is a
    lack of symmetry in that the questions focus only on OCAP and do not refer to
    possible bias in favour of the police.  I
    would first observe that the submission as to the breadth of the questions is
    raised for the first time on appeal.  Crown counsel at trial raised no objection to the scope of the
    questions, other than arguing that no evidentiary basis had been made out for
    including membership in CUPE in the challenge.  The trial judge accepted that argument and the challenge for cause was
    limited to OCAP.  On that basis alone I
    would be inclined not to give effect to this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the lack of symmetry of the questions, as set out
    above, the question of possible bias in favour of the police was raised for the
    first time after the trial judge’s decision on the defence challenge for
    cause.  Crown counsel initially raised
    the issue on the basis that the trial judge could pre-screen jurors for police
    affiliation under s. 632 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The power under s. 632 is a limited one,
    designed to deal with cases of obvious partiality.  I did not understand Crown counsel on this
    appeal to argue that the trial judge erred in refusing to use the s. 632
    procedure for the purpose of testing pro-police bias.  While Crown counsel at trial suggested that
    questions about relationship to the police could be added to the challenge for
    cause, that option was not seriously pursued at trial and Crown counsel at
    trial did not adduce any material to support the position that persons with
    some relationship with the police would have a material bias in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I do not accept that the challenge for cause questions
    constituted an impermissible inquiry into political beliefs.  I agree that generally, inquiry into
    membership in organizations, let alone membership of family members, is
    impermissible and should not be allowed.  However, this was an exceptional case and the questions focused on membership
    in OCAP, financial support for OCAP and participation in OCAP demonstrations.  The questions were directly relevant to the
    issues in the case which concerned the manner in which an OCAP demonstration
    was handled by the police and, in particular, by this particular respondent.  They were designed to identify potential
    jurors that might have the material bias in question.  Membership and financial support for OCAP, as
    well as participation in its demonstrations, would provide relevant
    circumstantial evidence of such bias.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I tend to agree that the questions about activities of
    family members were unnecessary and should not have been included.  However, there was no objection by Crown
    counsel at trial and I can see no prejudice to the prosecution.  To the contrary, it may well be that the
    experienced Crown counsel at trial was satisfied that an inquiry about the
    activities of family members was not wholly irrelevant, given that after the
    trial judge’s ruling on the challenge for cause, she asked the trial judge to
    pre-screen jurors for “whether or not they have any family members who are
    police officers or work with the police service”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3)<i>       Provided
    information to defence</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A challenge for cause strays into illegitimacy “if used
    merely, without more … as a ‘fishing expedition’ in order to obtain personal
    information about the juror”:  <i>R. v.
    Sherratt</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 509, at p. 533.  However, since I have found that the trial judge did not err in
    permitting the challenge for cause in this case, it is no objection that the
    challenge for cause happened to produce information that might have been of use
    to the parties in exercising their peremptory challenges.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)<i>       The
    process of demonizing OCAP</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the challenge for cause began a
    process of demonizing OCAP and its supporters, including the complainant.  I do not accept this submission.  The questions cannot reasonably bear that
    interpretation.  Further, in considering
    this submission it is necessary to have regard to the entire challenge for cause
    process, which included extensive instructions from the trial judge about the
    purpose of the jury selection process and which emphasized the importance of
    impartiality.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(5)<i>       The
    challenge for cause process</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in
    withdrawing the decision whether a prospective juror was acceptable from the
    triers whenever the prospective juror answered “no” to the first three
    questions.  It is submitted that this was
    a jurisdictional error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even though there was no objection at trial, Crown
    counsel now submits that the procedure followed was fatally flawed.  He relies on this court’s decision in <i>R.
    v. Wade</i>, [1990] O.J. No. 1768, which appears to stand for the proposition
    that once the challenge is in the hands of the triers, it must be disposed of by
    them.  In <i>Wade</i>, on several
    occasions, Crown counsel purported to admit the challenge based on the answers
    from the prospective jurors.  On those
    occasions, the prospective juror was discharged without a decision from the
    triers.  In <i>Wade</i>, the court had to consider its earlier
    decision in <i>R. v. Hubbert</i> (1975), 11 O.R. (2d) 464 at p. 479, where the
    court held that the other party may admit the challenge, in which case the
    matter is not submitted to the triers.  It
    would seem to follow that the party making the challenge may withdraw the
    challenge, which was what, in effect, happened in this case.  Be that as it may, the court in <i>Wade</i> interpreted <i>Hubbert</i> to the effect that it did not apply “once the trial of the truth
    of the challenge is in the hands of the triers”, namely, once the questioning
    of the prospective juror had begun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read this court’s decision in <i>Wade</i>,
    although it allowed the accused’s appeal because of several other errors in the
    charge to the jury and in answers to questions from the jury, the error in the
    challenge for cause procedure was held not to be a reversible error.  The court began its brief discussion of that
    ground of appeal with the observation  “[w]e
    do not think that any prejudice occurred in this case by what was done”.  The same can be said here.  I can see no possible prejudice to the Crown
    from the procedure followed.  By their
    answers, the prospective jurors demonstrated that they had no material
    bias.  There was really nothing for the
    triers to decide.  As Mr. Sandler,
    counsel for the respondent, put it, there was no claim of partiality left: defence
    counsel was no longer pursuing the claim of partiality in respect of those
    prospective jurors who answered “no” to the first three questions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the possible unfairness in allowing the other
    party to admit a challenge after questioning has begun does not occur where the
    challenge is simply withdrawn.  The
    problem with allowing the other party to admit the challenge is that, in
    effect, that party obtains an unlimited number of peremptory challenges which
    the party can use with the advantage of the information gained from the
    challenge for cause process: see <i>R. v. Shergill</i> (1996), 4 C.R. (5th) 28
    (Ont. Gen. Div.).  Where the challenge is
    simply withdrawn, the parties remain on an equal footing; they can choose to
    use their peremptory challenges as they see fit.  Neither side gains an advantage from the
    process.  There was no unfairness to any
    party by what occurred in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as it was the respondent who had brought the
    challenge for cause, if any party <i>was</i> prejudiced by the procedure adopted by the trial judge, it was the
    respondent.  It was the respondent who
    was possibly deprived of a decision from triers that might have excluded a
    potential juror for cause, and instead forced to use his peremptory
    challenges.  I do not see how it is open
    to the Crown at this juncture, having raised no objection at trial, to rely
    upon an error that did not prejudice its interests.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The situation in this case is not unlike what occurred
    in <i>R. v. Cloutier</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, where the Crown, on an appeal
    from acquittal, sought to rely on the fact that the accused had erroneously
    been deprived of the right to challenge a prospective juror peremptorily.  The court refused to give effect to this
    argument from the Crown.  As Pratte J.
    said at p. 725 for the majority of the court:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The prosecution may not complain about the fact
    that the accused exercised, or failed to exercise, one of his rights of
    challenge: the interests of the prosecution are not affected in either case.
    The reason why the accused does not exercise a right of challenge matters
    little; whether it is the decision of the accused or that of the judge, the
    situation of the prosecution is in no way altered: it still retains its rights
    of challenge and standby. <i>If a juror is not acceptable to the prosecution,
    it should not rely on the accused to challenge him: it must challenge him
    itself by exercising the rights conferred on it by law.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court applied <i>Cloutier</i> in <i>R. v.
    Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  In that case, the trial judge had adopted an unauthorized procedure
    after the jury panel had been exhausted without a complete jury being
    selected.  The court held that the procedure
    adopted by the trial judge deprived the accused of a statutory right conferred
    on them by (what is now) s. 642, and necessitated a new trial.  The Crown then argued that the new trial
    should also be in respect of the counts on which one of the accused had been
    acquitted.  Despite the serious nature of
    the error, this court held that the verdict of acquittal was not a nullity, and
    refused the Crown request on the basis that the holding in <i>Cloutier</i> was
    “conclusive against the Crown’s submissions on this point”: p. 73.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the foregoing, the Crown submits that the failure
    of the trial judge to strictly comply with the statutorily prescribed challenge
    for cause procedure amounted to a jurisdictional error, and cannot be
    characterized as a simple procedural defect that had no prejudicial
    effect.  On this point, the Crown relies
    both on this court’s decision in <i>R. v.
    W.V.</i>, 2007 ONCA 546 and the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>W.V.</i>, the
    trial judge had the first two jurors sworn act as the triers for the rest of
    the jury selection, instead of having each challenge decided by the two most
    recently sworn jurors, as mandated by s. 640(2).  The court held that the trial judge has no
    inherent authority to modify that procedure, and that it was crucial to the
    empanelling of an impartial jury.  The
    court further held that the curative provision of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> had no application, at para. 26:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By spreading the authority
    to decide the challenge for cause in this manner, s. 640(2) guarantees that a
    variety of views and perspectives will be brought to bear on the fundamental
    question of how the jury is to be constituted. In my view, a departure from
    this carefully constructed scheme for deciding who shall sit in judgment of the
    accused cannot be described as a minor procedural defect, nor is it an error that
    can be cured by applying s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iv) as that section has been
    interpreted by this court and by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court that
    tried and convicted the appellant was improperly constituted. As the trial
    court never had jurisdiction to try the appellant, s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iv) has no
    application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Barrow</i>, the trial judge had potential jurors
    sworn who he then personally questioned on grounds of partiality.  He did so out of earshot of the accused and
    over the objection of the accused.  Dickson C.J., in addressing the effect on the case of a provision of
    Nova Scotia’s <i>Juries Act</i>, S.N.S.
    1969, c. 12, held, at p. 714: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The province cannot give the judge any power to
    make decision as to partiality and any judge who attempts to participate in
    such decisions usurps the function of the jurors established by s. 569(2) [now
    s. 640(2)].  Usurpation of this sort is
    so severe an error of law by the judge that it mandates a new trial, even if no
    prejudice to the accused can be shown. The judge’s role is to supervise trials
    of partiality, not to decide them. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these cases do not support the Crown’s
    position.  It may well be, following <i>Wade</i>, that the procedure adopted by the
    trial judge in this case was improper and that he should have let the triers
    decide the challenge for cause, despite the negative answer to the first three
    questions.  However, that error is of a
    different nature than that in <i>W.V</i>.  The trial judge in <i>W.V. </i>failed
    to comply with a specific statutory component of the jury selection
    process.  In contrast, the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> does not expressly prohibit a party from withdrawing or abandoning a
    challenge for cause, as happened in this case.  Additionally, the procedure followed in this case did not undermine the
    impartiality of the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to <i>Barrow,</i> Dickson C.J’s statement in that
    case was said in the context where the judge truly arrogated to himself a power
    to decide disputed questions of partiality.  In this case, there was no longer any dispute about the juror’s
    partiality once they answered “no” to the first three questions.  Defence counsel, whose challenge it was,
    accepted that to be the fact and Crown counsel did not dispute the point.  In my view, what occurred in this case did
    not suffer the same fundamental defect with which the court in <i>Barrow</i> was concerned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My conclusion that the lack of prejudice occasioned by
    the challenge for cause procedure adopted in this case justifies dismissing the
    appeal gains assistance from the provisions of s. 686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iv) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, which gives an
    appellate court the power to dismiss an appeal by an accused where
    “notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had
    jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and
    the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice
    thereby”.  This provision does not
    directly apply to Crown appeals.  However,
    in <i>R. v. Vezeau</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 27, the court held that even though (what
    is now) s. 686(4), which deals with Crown appeals, does not contain a “no
    substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice provision”, as is found in s.
    686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iii) for appeals by accused from conviction, the court
    nevertheless should apply an analogous test where the Crown appeals from an
    acquittal.  Thus, the court held that in
    deciding whether to exercise its discretion under s. 686(4) to set aside an
    acquittal, it would only do so where the Crown established that the verdict
    would not necessarily have been the same.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time <i>Vezeau</i> was decided, s. 686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iv)
    had not yet been enacted.  That provision
    only came into force in June 1985.  In my
    view, adopting a similar approach to that taken in <i>Vezeau</i>, the court ought not to set aside an acquittal where a
    procedural irregularity was of a relatively minor nature and caused no
    prejudice to the Crown.  Based on the
    negative answers given by the jurors to the first three questions, there would
    have been no evidentiary basis for the triers to find that the potential jurors
    were partial.  Experienced Crown counsel
    at trial obviously perceived no prejudice at trial since she raised no objection
    at any time.  The only practical result
    of the process was that the defence was required to use 11 of its 12 peremptory
    challenges to excuse jurors who hypothetically might have been discharged by
    the triers.  By contrast, Crown counsel
    only used two of her 12 peremptory challenges.  It is pure speculation that the process followed by the trial judge in
    this case had any impact on the trial.  I
    would not set aside an acquittal on the basis of speculation, nor allow the
    Crown to take advantage of errors that did not prejudice its interests.</p>

    that if he could not succeed on the jury selection grounds of appeal, these
    other grounds of appeal on their own would not warrant a new trial.  In the circumstances, I need not deal with
