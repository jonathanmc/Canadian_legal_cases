'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An accused has a constitutional right to remain
    silent throughout the criminal process prior to conviction.  There are, however, some qualifications on
    that right.  One arises where an accused
    chooses to advance an alibi defence.  An
    accused <span class=GramE>who</span> advances an alibi defence must make timely
    disclosure of the substance of that defence to the prosecution or run the risk
    of an adverse inference being drawn by the trier of fact from the failure to
    make timely disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal turns on whether the trial judge
    erred in law in characterizing the appellant’s position as an alibi defence,
    which, absent timely disclosure, triggered an adverse inference instruction to
    the jury.  I would hold that the trial
    judge did err in law and that the instruction should not have been given.  The <i>curative
    proviso</i> cannot be applied despite the absence of any objection by trial
    counsel.  The appeal must be allowed, the
    convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.</p>
  <h2><span class=GramE>II.</span><span>        </span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged with robbery and other
    related offences.  All of the charges
    arose out of the same incident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence is straightforward.  Marlon Acosta, a fourteen-year old boy and
    the Crown’s main witness, testified that on the day of the alleged robbery, an
    acquaintance, Carise Reid, showed up at his apartment.  She was with two male friends.  Ms. Reid asked Mr. Acosta to take them to
    “Randy’s house”.  Mr. Acosta understood
    this to be a reference to Randy Hannaford.  Mr. Hannaford, a nineteen year-old teenager, lived nearby in the same
    housing complex.  Mr. Acosta later
    identified the appellant in a photo line-up as one of the two young men who
    arrived at his apartment with Ms. Reid.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Acosta agreed to take the two young men to
    Mr. Hannaford’s apartment.  Ms. Reid
    remained behind.  Mr. Acosta testified
    that when he and the two other men arrived at Mr. Hannaford’s apartment, they
    pushed him into the apartment.  The appellant
    struck Mr. Hannaford on the head with a handgun.  The appellant’s companion forced Mr. Acosta
    into the bathroom.  Mr. Hannaford was
    pushed into the bathroom a short time later.  He was very angry and attacked Mr. Acosta.  Mr. Acosta and Mr. Hannaford remained in the
    bathroom until they heard the appellant and his companion leave Mr. Hannaford’s
    apartment.  They left the bathroom a
    short time later.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hannaford testified for the Crown.  He had been struck in the head several times
    during the robbery and purported to have virtually no recollection of the
    relevant events.  He had been unable to
    identify the appellant in a photo line-up.  He testified that the robbers stole some clothing, a video game system
    and about $20.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Reid was the only defence witness.  She testified that on the day of the robbery,
    she was approached by three young men, one of whom was the appellant.  She did not know these young men, but they
    asked her if she knew where they could buy some marijuana.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Reid took the three young men to see Mr.
    Acosta, whom she knew from prior experience to be a marijuana smoker.  Mr. Acosta spoke to his supplier on the
    telephone and then indicated that if the young men gave him their money, he
    would make the marijuana purchase for them.  The young men declined this offer and insisted that they go with Mr.
    Acosta to see his supplier and purchase the marijuana.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Reid testified that Mr. Acosta and two of
    the young men she was with headed off to purchase the marijuana.  She and the appellant remained behind in the
    vicinity of Mr. Acosta’s apartment.  They
    chatted for about 15 minutes.  The appellant
    tried to convince Ms. Reid to go out with him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Reid saw Mr. Acosta return about 20 minutes
    after he had left.  His face was bruised
    and he had blood on his shirt.  Ms. Reid
    tried to speak with him, but Mr. Acosta was angry and refused to talk with
    her.  Ms. Reid later learned that Mr. Acosta
    had been robbed and beaten.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police became aware of Ms. Reid’s
    involvement in the relevant events shortly after the robbery occurred.  Two officers attempted to interview her at
    her home about a week after the robbery.  Ms. Reid’s mother was very antagonistic toward the police.  She insisted that they leave her home.  Ms. Reid did not want to get involved in the
    police investigation.  She told the
    police that she had seen Mr. Acosta on the day in question but offered no
    further assistance.  She did not say
    anything about the appellant.  The police
    did not make further efforts to interview Ms. Reid.  She was not called as a witness at the
    preliminary inquiry.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Reid indicated that she was aware the
    appellant wanted her to testify for him some time before the trial.  She was reluctant to do so but eventually
    agreed to assist him.  It would appear,
    however, that she attended at the trial in response to a Crown subpoena.  Ms. Reid first spoke to the appellant’s
    counsel when she attended at the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defence first gave the Crown notice of its
    intention to call Ms. Reid and of the substance of her evidence shortly after
    the trial had commenced about two years after the relevant events.  At the conclusion of the evidence, Crown
    counsel requested an adverse inference instruction based on the failure to make
    timely disclosure of what the Crown characterized as an alibi defence.  Defence counsel took no exception to this request.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge in the course of a balanced and
    well crafted jury instruction told the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this case, the
    defence alibi was raised for the first time last Wednesday, June the 1st,
    2005.  Prior to that, no notice of this
    defence was given to the prosecution.  Accordingly, the Crown has not been given an opportunity to conduct a
    meaningful investigation of the validity of the alibi defence prior to
    trial.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>You may consider the fact that the defence
    was raised for the first time only one week ago in assessing the weight of the
    evidence, and you may but you do not have to draw an adverse inference about
    its validity, and you may, but you do not have to disregard it</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She repeated the adverse inference instruction as
    part of her response to a jury question.  The jury returned its verdict about eight minutes after the recharge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence counsel did not object to the adverse
    inference instruction either before the initial charge to the jury or in
    response to the jury’s question.  It is
    fair to say that defence counsel implicitly accepted the appropriateness of the
    instruction.  </p>
  <h2><span class=GramE>III.</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The criminal process is both accusatorial and
    adversarial.  Respect for individual
    autonomy and privacy dictates that when the prosecution levels a criminal
    accusation, it must investigate and prove its case without any compelled
    assistance from the target of that accusation.  The constitutional right to silence, the constitutional protection
    against self-incrimination and the constitutionally protected presumption of
    innocence all reflect the fundamental importance of the principle protecting an
    accused from conscription to the cause of the prosecution.  An accused is constitutionally entitled to
    say “prove it” and nothing more in answer to a criminal charge.  For convenience, I will refer to this
    constellation of constitutional rights as the right to silence:  see <i>R.
    v. Noble</i> (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Cleghorn</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 393 (S.C.C.), per Iacobucci
    J. at para. 4, per Major J. (dissenting on another point) at paras. 20-23; <i>R. v. Chambers</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d)
    321 (S.C.C.), at p. 341.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are qualifications on the accused’s right
    to silence.  One such qualification
    arises where an accused advances an alibi defence.  If the accused fails to make timely disclosure
    to the prosecution of the substance of the alibi (or fails to testify in
    support of the alibi), the trier of fact may, not must, draw an adverse
    inference against the defence from that failure:  <i>R. v.
    Noble</i>, at para. 111; <i>R. v. Cleghorn</i>; <i>R. v. Crawford</i> (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d)
    481 (S.C.C.), at pp. 494-95; <i>R. v.
    Chambers</i>, at p. 343; <i>R. v. P. (M.B.)</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), at pp. 304-05; <i>R. v. Hill</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 469 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 476-77.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The qualification on the right to silence that
    arises where alibi is raised is said to be a rule of “expediency” borne out of
    the nature of the alibi defence.  The
    word “alibi” means “elsewhere”.  Where an
    accused advances an alibi defence, he claims that as he was elsewhere he could
    not have committed the crime alleged.  The alibi defence moves the factual focus from the facts alleged by the
    Crown to an entirely different factual scenario.  But for the alibi defence, the factual
    scenario introduced by the alibi has no relevance to the Crown’s
    allegation.  In the normal course, the
    Crown would have no way of knowing that the facts introduced by the alibi claim
    had relevance to the charge.  As R.N.
    Gooderson put it in his text, <i>Alibi</i> (London: Heinemann Educational Books, 1977), at p. 30, cited with approval by
    Major J. in <i>Cleghorn</i>, at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Alibi evidence,
    by its very nature, takes the focus right away from the area of the main facts,
    and gives a defence a fresh and untrammelled start.  It is easy to prepare perjured evidence to
    support it in advance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The common law has responded to the risk of
    fabrication and the Crown’s inability to effectively challenge alibi defences
    revealed long after the relevant events occurred by permitting the trier of
    fact to draw an adverse inference against the veracity of those defences.  The constitutionality of this qualification
    on the right to silence has been accepted in this court and is not challenged
    on this appeal:  see <i>R. v. Hill</i>, at p. 477.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  One cannot, however, lose sight of the fact
    that the adverse inference instruction is a qualification on constitutionally
    enshrined principles.  The qualification can
    be justified only where the rationale for that qualification actually
    operates.  Thus, if the alibi defence is
    disclosed in time to permit meaningful investigation of the defence, there can
    be no justification for the instruction:  see <i>R. v. Hogan</i> (1982), 2
    C.C.C. (3d) 557 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 566; <i>Cleghorn</i>,
    at paras. 3-5.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no suggestion in this case that timely
    disclosure was made.  The question is –
    did the Crown require that disclosure to be in a position to effectively
    investigate and respond to the defence actually advanced by the appellant?  I do not think that it did.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s defence, as advanced through Ms.
    Reid, was not based on facts extraneous to the facts as alleged by the
    Crown.  To use the language adopted in <i>Cleghorn</i>, at para. 22, the appellant’s
    defence was not “entirely divorced from the main factual issues surrounding the <i>corpus delicti</i>”.  The defence was an admission of some involvement
    in the relevant events coupled with a denial of any involvement in the crimes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s defence came from Ms. Reid, a
    person who on the Crown’s version was directly involved in the events leading
    up to the crime.  On the Crown’s evidence,
    the appellant arrived at Mr. Acosta’s apartment with Ms. Reid.  The prosecution clearly knew that Ms. Reid
    had material evidence to give concerning what, if anything, the appellant had
    to do with the events subsequent to their arrival at Mr. Acosta’s apartment and
    specifically with the robbery.  The prosecution
    did not need advance notice from the defence to appreciate that Ms. Reid’s
    version of events was relevant to its case against the appellant.  Indeed, the police attempted, albeit
    unsuccessfully, to obtain her version of events.  It cannot be said that without advance notice
    from the defence the prosecution had no reason or opportunity to explore Ms.
    Reid’s version of the relevant events.  Consequently,
    the rationale for the adverse inference instruction does not operate in this
    case.  </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a second way of looking at the nature
    of the appellant’s defence that also leads to the conclusion that it is
    improperly characterized as an alibi defence.  An alibi claim places an accused elsewhere and does not implicate the
    accused in any way in the crime with which he or she is charged.  Had the appellant disclosed his defence, he
    would have implicated himself by acknowledging his presence at the outset of
    the transaction with those who eventually committed the crimes.  Prior disclosure of this kind of defence could
    well generate new theories of liability based on accessorial
    responsibility.  To require an accused to
    disclose this kind of defence and thereby implicate <span class=GramE>himself</span> in the crime, or risk an adverse inference instruction is to impose a
    significant intrusion on the accused’s right to silence.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    inference instruction.  The Crown submits
    that the error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The Crown contends that the prosecution’s
    case was strong and that Ms. Reid’s evidence was inherently incredible.  </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not apply the <i>curative proviso</i>.  This was
    not an overwhelming case for the Crown.  That
    case rested largely on the out-of-court identification of the appellant made by
    Mr. Acosta.  Aspects of that
    identification procedure were problematic.  Furthermore, the misdirection constituted a direct and powerful blow
    against the defence.  This was no minor
    error on the periphery of the case.  </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown placed considerable emphasis on the
    defence position at trial.  Defence counsel
    (not Mr. Dineen) accepted the correctness of the instruction now
    challenged.  The defence position at
    trial is an important consideration when determining the application of the <i>curative proviso</i>.  That position may reflect on the significance
    of the error or may represent a tactical choice made by counsel.  However, counsel’s position at trial is not
    determinative of the application of the <i>proviso</i>:  see <i>R.
    v. Van</i>, 2009 SCC 22, at para. 43.  </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There could have been no tactical reason behind
    counsel’s position that an adverse inference instruction was appropriate.  That instruction could not possibly have
    assisted the defence.  On any view, the
    defence was better off without it.  Trial
    counsel must have thought that the law required the instruction.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The present case has much in common with the
    facts in <i>R. v. Hill</i>, also a case
    where a defence was improperly characterized as an alibi defence and an adverse
    inference instruction was given.  In <i>Hill</i>, there was also no objection to
    that instruction.  I would adopt the
    reasoning of my colleague, Laskin J.A., at pp. 479-80 for rejecting the
    argument that the <i>curative proviso</i> could
    be applied to the error.</p>

    troubling.  For example, if an accused
    claimed that he and a friend remained in a vehicle while unbeknownst to them a
    third friend went inside and robbed a convenience store, that accused would, on
    the Crown’s approach, be advancing an alibi defence requiring prior notice or
    the risk of an adverse inference instruction.  The risk of an adverse inference instruction absent disclosure of that
    kind of defence would, in my view, be a substantial intrusion on the right to
    silence.</p>
