  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>I.         OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury acquitted the respondent of first degree murder.  The Crown
    appeals, alleging that the trial judge erred in law in excluding evidence
    relating to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo the respondent had inscribed on
    his face a few months after the murder.  At trial, the Crown contended that the
    excluded evidence, considered as a whole, provided evidence from which the jury
    could infer that the respondent had killed a rival gang member.  The Crown
    contended that this evidence, placed in the context of the rest of the
    evidence, provided a strong case identifying the respondent as the killer of
    Simeon Peter, the victim named in the indictment.  Identity was the only live
    factual issue at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown attempted to elicit evidence as to the meaning of the teardrop
    tattoo from three gang members, A.B., C.S. and G.D.;<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Detective Sergeant Quan, a police officer with extensive involvement with
    Toronto street gangs; and Dr. Mark Totten, an acknowledged expert in the
    culture of Canadian street gangs.  For various and different reasons, the trial
    judge refused to allow any of these witnesses to testify as to their
    understanding of the meaning of the teardrop tattoo.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Crown argues that the exclusion of the evidence of the
    gang members, standing alone, constitutes a reversible error in law.  Crown
    counsel makes the same submission with respect to the exclusion of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence.  Counsel submits that the exclusion of Detective Sergeant Quan’s
    evidence, while not sufficient on its own to merit a new trial, exacerbates the
    improper exclusion of the other evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal.  For the reasons that follow, I would hold
    that the trial judge erred in excluding Dr. Totten’s evidence insofar as that
    evidence identified the potential meanings of the teardrop tattoo within the
    urban street gang culture.  I would also hold that the three gang members
    should have been allowed to testify as to the meaning of that tattoo within the
    culture that they shared with the respondent.  Finally, I would hold that the
    witness, G.D., should have been allowed to provide evidence of his comments
    concerning the respondent’s tattoo, made during his conversation with the
    respondent immediately before the respondent’s description of his involvement
    in the murder.  Had G.D. been allowed to testify to the entirety of this
    interaction, a jury may well have inferred from the respondent’s conduct that
    the inscription of the tattoo on his face was related to the murder.  The
    improperly excluded evidence, taken as a package, could well have affected the
    verdict.  The acquittal must be quashed and a new trial ordered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will not address the merits of the Crown’s argument that the trial
    judge should have admitted the evidence of Detective Sergeant Quan.  The trial
    record on this issue is unclear in many respects and the appeal can be resolved
    without deciding the admissibility of this evidence.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>II.        THE EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 2004, two Toronto street gangs, the Malvern Crew and the
    Galloway Boys, both of whom claimed parts of Scarborough as their territory,
    were engaged in a bloody turf war.  Several members of the Malvern Crew had
    been the targets of drive-by shootings attributed to the Galloway Boys.  Any
    sighting of a member of the Galloway Boys in the part of Scarborough regarded
    as Malvern territory could instigate a violent reaction by members of the
    Malvern Crew.  The respondent lived in Empringham, part of the Malvern district
    of Scarborough.  He was an associate of the Malvern Crew with ties to a gang
    called the “Emps”, a subset of the Malvern Crew operating in the Empringham
    area.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the afternoon of January 8, 2004, Mr. Simeon Peter and his
    girlfriend, Clorie-Ann Anderson, were walking towards Ms. Anderson’s home in
    the Malvern district of Scarborough.  Ms. Anderson noticed that they were being
    followed.  Mr. Peter slowed down and fell behind Ms. Anderson.  The person
    following Mr. Peter opened fire, striking Mr. Peter with at least one bullet. 
    The shooter approached the wounded Mr. Peter and shot him from close range.  He
    then fled the scene, running through backyards in the direction of Empringham
    Park.  The police later found seven cartridge casings along the route where the
    shots were fired.  The post-mortem examination revealed that Mr. Peter had been
    shot three times.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was agreed at trial that the murder was gang related and that one or
    more of the Malvern Crew had killed Mr. Peter believing that he was a member of
    the Galloway Boys.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
    The Crown contended that the respondent was the shooter and that he had the
    help of A.B. and C.S., two other Malvern Crew members.  The defence did not
    call any evidence but argued that the respondent had nothing to do with the
    shooting and that A.B. and/or C.S. had killed Mr. Peter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was not arrested until March 2005, some 14 months after
    the homicide.  Apart from the excluded teardrop tattoo evidence, the Crown’s
    case was based on evidence of motive; the testimony of A.B. and C.S.; the
    testimony of G.D., a third member of the Malvern Crew; and some circumstantial
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown advanced two motives for the murder.  First, the Crown
    contended that the respondent and his accomplices decided to kill Mr. Peter
    because, as members of the Malvern Crew, they believed that Mr. Peter, who they
    thought was a member of the rival Galloway Boys, had no right to be in their
    territory.  The Crown contended that in the street gang world inhabited by the
    respondent and his accomplices, a rival gang member’s presence in the territory
    of the Malvern Crew was enough to justify killing that individual.  The Crown
    led evidence to establish the existence of these street gangs, their respective
    territories, their bloody rivalry, and the manner in which they operated.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second motive relied on by the Crown was more personal to the
    respondent.  When Mr. Peter was seen by A.B. and C.S. on January 8, 2004, they
    mistakenly believed that he was a person named “Tevin”, a Galloway Boys gang
    member who had recently robbed the respondent.  They reported this information to
    the respondent who, on the Crown’s theory, went after Mr. Peter and shot him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown alleged that A.B. and C.S. assisted the respondent in the
    commission of the murder.  Both were members of the Malvern Crew.  They had
    criminal records and were admitted drug dealers.  Both testified as part of a
    plea agreement, which saw them receive lenient treatment in return for
    acknowledging their involvement in the Malvern Crew, admitting responsibility
    in certain criminal activities and testifying against the respondent.  The
    trial judge cautioned the jury against relying on the unconfirmed evidence of
    either A.B. or C.S.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B. testified that on January 8, 2004, he and C.S. were driving through
    Scarborough on their way to Ajax, Ontario to see another member of the Malvern
    Crew.  As they approached the highway, they noticed Ms. Anderson and Mr.
    Peter.  C.S. recognized Ms. Anderson as a person who went out with members of
    the Galloway Boys.  A.B. and C.S. decided that Mr. Peter could well be a member
    of the Galloway Boys and that he should not be in the Malvern Crew territory.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B. testified that he and C.S. decided to go to the respondent’s home
    as it was nearby.  They needed a gun to go after Mr. Peter and they knew that
    the respondent had access to the guns communally used by members of the Malvern
    Crew.  A.B. also thought that the respondent would be interested in going after
    Mr. Peter because he believed Mr. Peter was the man named “Tevin” who had
    robbed the respondent about a week earlier.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B. and C.S. arrived at the respondent’s home and told him that they
    had seen a suspected Galloway Boys member in their territory.  They told the
    respondent that it could be “Tevin” – the person who had robbed him.  According
    to A.B., the respondent agreed to go after this person.  He was armed.  The
    three men drove to where Mr. Peter and Ms. Anderson had been seen earlier by
    A.B. and C.S.  They saw Mr. Peter and Ms. Anderson get on a bus.  They followed
    the bus until Ms. Anderson and Mr. Peter disembarked.  The respondent got out
    of the car and followed Ms. Anderson and Mr. Peter on foot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B. and C.S. drove to Ajax.  About twenty minutes after letting the
    respondent out of the car, A.B. called him on his home number and spoke with
    him.  He did not ask the respondent what had happened because he thought the
    phone could be tapped by the police.  He asked the respondent if everything was
    okay, and the respondent replied that it was.  A.B. told him he should take a
    shower.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B. spoke to the respondent the next day.  The respondent told A.B.
    that he believed that Mr. Peter had a gun so he had shot him in the leg from
    behind.  He then ran up to Mr. Peter and shot him again.  The respondent went
    on to tell A.B. that he turned the gun on Ms. Anderson intending to shoot her
    but that he was out of bullets.  The respondent recounted how he ran home and
    subsequently disposed of the gun.  A.B. also testified about other similar
    conversations with the respondent.  The respondent complained that rumours were
    circulating that he was the shooter and that he was being teased for having run
    out of bullets before he could shoot Ms. Anderson.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.S. denied any involvement in the murder.  He testified that he was in
    his vehicle with A.B. and the respondent when they saw Mr. Peter and Ms.
    Anderson standing at a bus shelter.  There was some discussion about Mr. Peter
    being a member of the Galloway Boys, but there was no discussion about doing
    him any harm.  According to C.S., shortly after they passed the bus shelter,
    the respondent left the vehicle indicating he wanted to visit a friend who
    lived nearby.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.S. testified that in the days after the murder, the respondent told
    him that he had shot Mr. Peter.  The respondent told C.S. that Mr. Peter was
    the person who had robbed him earlier.  The respondent described how he
    followed Mr. Peter and his girlfriend, shot Mr. Peter in the leg, caught up to
    him and shot him a couple more times.  The respondent also told C.S. that he
    had turned the gun on Ms. Anderson and tried to shoot her but that it was out
    of bullets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.S.’s credibility was even more suspect than A.B.’s credibility.  The
    Crown ultimately told the jury that it should reject C.S.’s evidence except
    where it was supported by other evidence.  In the end, the Crown relied only on
    C.S.’s evidence regarding the admissions made to him by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G.D., the third member of the Malvern Crew to testify for the Crown, had
    nothing to do with this murder.  G.D. was, however, a long-time senior member
    of the Malvern Crew street gang.  G.D. had a lengthy criminal record and had
    been arrested on a variety of offences.  He ultimately decided to cooperate
    with the police and give evidence concerning the operation of the Malvern Crew
    and his conversations with the respondent.  G.D. was serving a 12-year sentence
    when he testified against the respondent.  He had not entered into any plea
    agreement with the Crown in exchange for his testimony, however, his
    cooperation was considered by the trial judge as a mitigating factor when G.D.
    received the 12-year sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G.D. testified that the respondent told him that he and three other
    members of the Malvern Crew had killed Mr. Peter, who they believed to be a
    member of the rival gang.  According to the respondent, he was chosen as the
    shooter because the other three gang members knew Ms. Anderson.  G.D. testified
    that the respondent told him that he followed the victim and Ms. Anderson, shot
    the victim first in the leg and then chased him down and shot him again.  The
    respondent also told G.D. that he tried to shoot Ms. Anderson but that the gun
    was out of bullets.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the evidence from the gang members, there was some
    circumstantial evidence, which played a minor supporting role in the Crown’s
    case.  Cell phone records confirmed that the respondent was in the vicinity of
    the shooting shortly before it occurred and that he was at his residence, also
    within the vicinity of the shooting, shortly after the shooting occurred. 
    Shoeprint impressions taken at the scene indicated that the shooter probably
    wore size 13 Nike Air Force 1 shoes.  The respondent wore size 13 Nike Air
    Force 1 shoes.  The police could not, however, connect any shoes owned by the
    respondent to the murder scene.  The shoes he was wearing when arrested, some
    14 months after the homicide, were not manufactured until sometime after the
    homicide.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Expert evidence also established that the seven cartridge casings found
    at the scene of the murder matched a .45 calibre semi-automatic handgun
    manufactured by Springfield Armory.  That gun is a near exact replica of the
    Colt model handgun commonly referred to as a “Colt .45”.  A.B. testified that
    Malvern Crew gang members, including the respondent, had access to a communal
    “Colt .45” handgun.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>III.      THE ADMISSIBILITY OF DR. TOTTEN’S
    EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>(i)        Background</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown offered Dr. Totten, a sociologist, as an expert in the culture
    of urban street gangs in Canada.  The Crown proposed to have Dr. Totten give
    his opinion as to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo within the urban street gang
    culture and to give his opinion as to the meaning of the respondent’s teardrop
    tattoo.  The admissibility of this evidence was one of several issues addressed
    in a series of pre-trial motions that proceeded intermittently for several
    weeks prior to trial.  Dr. Totten prepared a report dated December 8, 2006.  He
    testified on a <i>voir dire</i> and his report was filed on consent.  Following
    Dr. Totten’s evidence, the trial judge expressed concerns about its
    admissibility and invited the Crown to address those concerns by way of further
    evidence from Dr. Totten.  Dr. Totten prepared a second report, dated January
    3, 2007, which was also filed as an exhibit. He testified for a second time. 
    The defence did not call any evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> and the trial
    judge’s ruling was based on Dr. Totten’s evidence and the contents of the two
    reports.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several facts were agreed upon for the purpose of determining the
    admissibility of Dr. Totten’s evidence.  It was agreed that the respondent was
    an associate of the Malvern Crew street gang with proven ties to the Emps, a
    subset of the Malvern Crew.  It was also agreed that the Malvern Crew and the
    Galloway Boys were involved in a bloody turf war in January 2004 when Mr. Peter
    was killed and that his murder was gang related.  Counsel further agreed for
    the purpose of the <i>voir dire</i> that the respondent had a teardrop tattoo
    inscribed on his face some time in May or June 2004, about four or five months
    after the homicide.  Counsel also agreed that no other member of the Galloway
    Boys was murdered in the first half of 2004 and that the person or persons who
    killed Mr. Peter believed that he was a member of the Galloway Boys.</p>

    penitentiary or a correctional institution.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This latter group of admissions was relevant to the three possible
    meanings of the teardrop tattoo put forward by Dr. Totten in his reports and
    testimony.</p>
  <p><b>(ii)       The Crown’s Position</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown contended that Dr. Totten’s expertise extended to the manner
    in which gang members communicated with each other and with members of other
    gangs.  Various symbols, including tattoos, had certain meanings within the
    gang culture and were used to communicate with fellow gang members and
    sometimes with rival gang members.  The Crown submitted that Dr. Totten’s
    numerous research studies, his long clinical experience and his review of the
    relevant academic literature, enabled him to offer the opinion that a teardrop
    tattoo inscribed on the face of a young gang member had one of three possible
    meanings.  One of those meanings was that the person with the tattoo had
    recently murdered a rival gang member.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown proposed to have Dr. Totten testify not only as to the three
    possible meanings of the teardrop tattoo, but also to answer a hypothetical
    question that would include factual assumptions eliminating the two other
    possible meanings.  In effect, the Crown wanted Dr. Totten to testify that,
    based on his knowledge of gang culture and the Crown’s assumptions (to be
    supported, presumably, by the evidence), the respondent’s inscription of a
    teardrop tattoo meant that he had killed a rival gang member.  In the context
    of the rest of the evidence, this could only mean that he had killed Mr. Peter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown took a less ambitious alternative position, submitting that
    Dr. Totten should be permitted to at least identify the three possible meanings
    of the teardrop tattoo within the urban street gang culture.  It would then be
    left to the Crown to lead evidence that would permit the jury, if so inclined,
    to exclude the other two possibilities, leaving only the explanation that the
    respondent had killed a rival gang member.  Crown counsel at trial expressed
    her alternative position in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he other position is that we would be asking Your
    Honour to also consider whether this gentleman can provide merely the
    definitions [explanations], because the definitions have been consistent
    throughout that there are, as he put it, three, though I see four.  There is
    three; one of them is double-barrelled:  loss of family member or a gang member
    has died; killed someone; or has spent time in prison.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Whether that definition – <i>we will be asking Your
    Honour to consider whether just merely the definition can be left to the jury,
    and then it is for the jury, not usurping the jury’s role, because then it is
    for the jury to decide whether they want to make the inferences that the Crown
    may ask them to make.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>(iii)     The Defence
    Position</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence did not argue that the meaning of the teardrop tattoo was
    not properly the subject of expert evidence.  Nor did the defence argue that
    Dr. Totten was not qualified to offer an opinion with respect to the meaning of
    a teardrop tattoo based on his study and knowledge of street gang culture.  The
    defence submitted, however, that Dr. Totten’s opinion concerning the meaning to
    be attributed to the respondent’s teardrop tattoo was not sufficiently reliable
    to justify risking the potential prejudice to the trial process that could flow
    should his opinion be heard by the jury.  In arguing that the potential
    probative value of the evidence was insufficient to risk the prejudice
    occasioned to the trial process, counsel stressed that Dr. Totten could not
    speak specifically to the meaning of the teardrop tattoo among members of the
    Malvern Crew.  Counsel also emphasized that Dr. Totten’s opinion could potentially
    be taken by the jury as determinative on the issue of identity, the only
    factual issue at trial.</p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>(iv)      Dr. Totten’s
    Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to detail Dr. Totten’s extensive and impressive
    academic, research and clinical credentials.  The trial judge accepted that Dr.
    Totten was a “preeminent leader” in his field – the study of the culture of
    street gangs in Canada.  The trial judge readily accepted that Dr. Totten’s
    expertise could assist the trier of fact in understanding how gang members communicate. 
    That expertise extended to the interpretation of tattoos; one of the symbols
    used by gang members to communicate with fellow gang members and with rival
    gangs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reports and testimony, Dr. Totten stated that it was his opinion
    that a teardrop tattoo on the face of a young male member of an urban street
    gang signified one of three things:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the death of a fellow gang member or family member of the wearer

font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that the wearer of the tattoo had served a period of incarceration
    in a correctional facility; or</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that the wearer of the tattoo had murdered a rival gang member.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten testified, however, that the meaning of a tattoo worn by any
    particular individual was ultimately a personal matter.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>In my opinion, and based on existing studies in
    the area, it is not possible to determine the meaning of a teardrop tattoo
    unless one spends a significant period of time with the person wearing the
    tattoo.  </i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>What’s important is to understand how he – the
    meanings that he attaches to the tattoo.  We can’t impute motives.  We can’t
    assume that we know why the tattoo has been inscribed under the eye.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So, if, for example, a researcher was merely to
    photograph people or just to use mug shots of offenders who had the tattoo, you
    can’t – you can’t imply that the reason that these individuals got the tattoo
    was for “X”.  <i>We know that there are at least three distinct possibilities.</i> 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This testimony echoes the comments in his January 3, 2007 report:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This means that one cannot ascribe one meaning only
    to the tear drop tattoo worn by an individual without having access to other
    supporting data.  <i>It is not possible to just look at someone with this
    tattoo and verify the meaning without having specific information on the
    individual and his gang.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten based his opinion as to the possible meanings of a teardrop
    tattoo on data gathered through several research projects conducted over ten
    years, information gained through a 25-year clinical practice involving
    long-term relationships with gang members both in and out of custody, and his
    review of the relevant academic literature.  Dr. Totten’s research consisted of
    six different studies conducted between 1995 and 2005.  These studies explored
    the day-to-day lives of gang members through detailed interviews with those who
    lived in that culture.  The manner in which gang members communicated,
    including various symbols used, was one of the many aspects of gang culture
    explored in these studies.  Questions about tattoos were a small part of a much
    wider range of questions.  The broad purpose of the studies was to understand
    the urban street gang world from the perspective of those who lived in that
    world.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of the research studies involved long interview sessions with gang
    members who agreed to be interviewed by Dr. Totten and his fellow researchers. 
    These interviews were recorded and the questioners took detailed notes.  The
    accumulated data were examined and assessed by the researchers.  Often, more
    than one researcher would examine the same data and their assessments would be
    compared.  Dr. Totten used the information garnered from these interviews and
    assessments when asked by the Crown to offer an opinion as to the meaning of
    the teardrop tattoo on the respondent’s face.  None of this information was
    gathered for the purpose of offering an opinion for the Crown in a criminal
    proceeding.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten described his research as qualitative and not quantitative. 
    He explained that quantitative studies employ large sample sizes, attempt to
    explore the strength of association between variables and establish
    generalizations applicable to populations beyond the study sample.  Qualitative
    research depends on information gleaned from individuals through a carefully
    constructed interview process.  In research involving cultural habits,
    knowledge gained through many individual interviews with persons who live
    within a given culture permits the researcher to come to conclusions about the
    meaning that members of that group or culture attribute to certain conduct or
    symbols.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten indicated that in the fields of criminology, sociology and
    anthropology, there is a long-established tradition of excellent qualitative
    research into the culture and lifestyle of various groups, including street
    gangs.  Dr. Totten referred to various well-recognized and accepted qualitative
    studies and reports on gang culture reaching back 80 years.  Dr. Totten gave
    uncontradicted evidence to the effect that qualitative research techniques had
    been proven to yield excellent and reliable data “on the fine details of gang
    life”.  In his assessment, quantitative studies based on statistical inferences
    could not provide the same insight into those “fine details”.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Dr. Totten described at length the steps taken by him, and others in
    his field, to enhance the reliability of answers received from those
    interviewed during his studies.  Several techniques were used to increase the
    reliability of the questioning process itself.  Interviews followed a fixed and
    carefully formulated format.  The language used in each question was selected
    using insight gained from the experience of prior studies and input from peer
    review of the proposed questions.  Dr. Totten sought to remove anything from
    the questions that was suggestive of the answer, ambiguous or would not have a
    common meaning across a broad spectrum of interviewees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten also explained that answers given by interviewees were not
    simply accepted at face value.  Answers were checked against reliable independent
    sources such as criminal records and police reports, a process called
    triangulation.  If information from these outside sources was inconsistent with
    the answers given, those answers were not accepted as accurate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten described at length a technique known as investigative
    discourse analysis.  Applying that technique, an examination of the actual
    language used by an interviewee in his answers afforded insight into the
    veracity of those answers.  Dr. Totten testified that this technique was well
    understood by him and other qualitative sociological researchers and that it
    had a long and well-established pedigree as a useful tool in his kind of
    research.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten also explained that several prospective subjects were
    excluded from his studies because there were reasons to doubt the reliability
    of any answers they might give.  Gang members suffering from mental disorders
    or severe drug abuse were not asked to participate in the studies.  Gang
    members who had been charged with a homicide related offence and who were
    awaiting trial were excluded from the study on the basis that their legal
    status gave them a motive to be less than honest about any criminal activity in
    which they had engaged.  About 45 gang members were excluded from the studies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten’s six studies involved interviews with 300 gang members
    between the ages of 15 and 26.  Roughly one half were in custody.  Ninety-seven
    of the gang members interviewed had been convicted of some form of homicide. 
    Of that group, 71 had teardrop tattoos under one eye.  Of the 203 not convicted
    of homicide, ten had teardrop tattoos under one eye.  In total, 81 of the 300
    gang members whose interviews were considered had a teardrop tattoo.  All 71
    gang members interviewed who had a teardrop tattoo and had also been convicted
    of a homicide related offence indicated that the teardrop tattoo signified that
    they had killed a rival gang member.  The ten gang members who had a teardrop
    tattoo but had not been convicted of a homicide related offence explained that
    the tattoo meant they had served time in a correctional institution.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten was questioned about the concept of peer review as it applied
    to his field of study.  He acknowledged the importance of peer review in
    sociological research.  Dr. Totten testified that in addition to the efforts
    made to carefully select those interviewed and to produce questions that
    yielded reliable answers, his studies underwent extensive peer reviews at
    several levels.  In any given study, the questions he intended to use to
    collect data and his proposed methodology were peer reviewed before conducting
    the study.  A post-study peer review occurred if any of the collected data were
    proposed for publication.  Co-authors, where studies involved Dr. Totten and
    another author, served as a means of peer review after the studies were
    completed.  Finally, those studies commissioned by a government ministry were
    subject to careful review by officials within the commissioning ministry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While Dr. Totten insisted that concepts such as error rates and random
    sampling applied to quantitative scientific research and not to qualitative
    behavioural analysis, he agreed that concerns about the reliability of one’s
    methodology and the validity of one’s results were as germane to his work as the
    work of those engaged in quantitative research.  However, in his view, given
    the very different nature of the research that he conducted as compared to
    quantitative research, different analytical tools than those used to assess
    quantitative research had to be used to assess the reliability of his methods
    and the validity of his results.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten found confirmation for the data collected in his studies from
    his own clinical experience.  In the course of a 25-year clinical practice, Dr.
    Totten had been involved in many long-term relationships with gang members. 
    During those relationships, he had had many conversations with gang members who
    had teardrop tattoos and had discussed with them what those tattoos meant to
    them.  The answers provided were consistent with the answers received in the
    studies conducted by Dr. Totten.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The six studies conducted by Dr. Totten involved interviews with young
    male gang members in most of the major cities across Canada.  His research was
    centered in Ottawa.  He interviewed ten persons who were members of street
    gangs in Toronto.  Dr. Totten did not interview any members of the Malvern
    Crew.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, Dr. Totten testified that his own experience and
    the academic literature suggested that the potential meanings of teardrop
    tattoos were not localized to any particular street gang, but cut across gang
    lines throughout North America.  He pointed to his clinical experience, some of
    which occurred in Chicago, as support for this observation.  Dr. Totten also
    indicated that his results were consistent with the results reported in
    American academic literature.  He opined that there was “no evidence at all to
    suggest that it [the teardrop tattoo] is the property of one or a couple of
    street gangs”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten was also questioned about the sample size of his studies.  He
    explained that as his data came from six separate studies, including some 300
    gang members, his sample size was much larger than the size commonly used for
    behavioural research involving street gangs. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten was asked how long after a homicide the perpetrator would
    typically inscribe a tattoo on his cheek.  Dr. Totten suggested that it could
    be between four months and a year after the homicide.  He acknowledged that he
    could not be very specific and that there was “quite a range”.  He thought it
    would be unusual for a gang member to inscribe the teardrop soon after the
    homicide because by doing so he would identify himself to knowledgeable people,
    including the police, as the perpetrator.  Dr. Totten did not refer to any
    specific parts of his studies or anything in the academic literature that
    directly addressed the amount of time that would pass after the homicide before
    the gang member who committed that homicide would have the teardrop tattoo
    inscribed on his face.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten agreed in cross-examination that gang symbols, including
    teardrop tattoos, could be used by “wannabees” or “poseurs” who wished to
    appear to be part of a gang culture but in reality had nothing to do with
    gangs, much less with the murder of rival gang members.  Dr. Totten thought
    this an unlikely explanation for the respondent’s teardrop tattoo in that he
    was an acknowledged member of the Malvern Crew and, as a result of this
    membership, he would be exposed to attack by other gang members if he inscribed
    a teardrop tattoo on his face and had not “earned” that tattoo.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten also agreed that the meanings of gang symbols, including
    tattoos, were subject to change: as those outside of the gang world became
    aware of and adopted gang symbols into parts of the mainstream culture, the
    meaning of those same symbols was lost or changed within the gang culture.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge began his reasons by reference to the criteria governing
    the admissibility of expert opinion evidence.  He quickly disposed of the
    criteria that were not in dispute before him.  He accepted, as did defence
    counsel, that Dr. Totten’s opinion was logically relevant to the identification
    of the respondent as the killer (para. 45).  Likewise, the trial judge accepted
    that Dr. Totten was properly qualified to give an opinion on aspects of gang
    culture, including the meaning of tattoos, and that this was a subject matter
    that was appropriate for expert evidence by a properly qualified expert (paras.
    13-15, 34).  Finally, although the trial judge did not expressly address this
    issue, there was no exclusionary rule apart from the rule governing the
    admissibility of expert opinion evidence barring the admissibility of Dr.
    Totten’s opinion.  Having disposed of the non-contentious issues, the trial
    judge turned his attention to the reliability of Dr. Totten’s opinion.  The
    trial judge appreciated that his role as “gatekeeper” required that he
    determine whether that evidence was sufficiently reliable to warrant its
    consideration by the jury.  He found that it was not.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave many reasons for rejecting Dr. Totten’s evidence as
    insufficiently reliable.  Several are summarized near the beginning of his
    reasons at para. 4:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Based on the evidence, I am not satisfied that Dr.
    Totten’s opinion is reliable.  First, Dr. Totten’s qualitative research is used
    to make specific quantitative conclusions.  Second, he cannot provide an error
    rate for his analysis.  Third, I have concerns about the small size of his
    study sample and its composition.  Fourth, his opinions clash with
    authoritative texts in the field.  Fifth, his attempts at verifying the
    “truth-status” of his interview subjects are suspect.  Sixth, his own
    conclusions are internally inconsistent – he often vacillated on the issues of
    whether the teardrop tattoo meaning was regional or universal, and whether the
    meaning could be generalized to individuals outside his study.  Seventh, he did
    not interview any members of the Malvern Crew – the very gang of which the
    accused is a member.  Eighth, Dr. Totten’s theories with respect to the meaning
    of the teardrop are rare, and have never been peer-reviewed or published.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the evidence was unreliable because,  in
    addition to the reasons set out in the above passage, it was not based on
    proven facts (para. 46) and did not take into account the possibility that the
    meaning of the teardrop tattoo could change in time (para. 70) or the
    possibility that a “poseur” or “wannabee” may inscribe the tattoo “as some kind
    of fad” (para. 66).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also characterized Dr. Totten’s opinion concerning the
    meaning of the tattoo as “a novel scientific theory”.  Having so characterized
    his opinion, the trial judge, applying binding authority, subjected Dr.
    Totten’s evidence to a more rigorous threshold reliability inquiry than would
    be the case if his opinion was not regarded as involving a novel scientific
    theory.  However, it would seem from the trial judge’s reasons that he would
    have excluded Dr. Totten’s evidence even on the lower threshold reliability
    requirement applicable to expert opinion evidence that does not involve a novel
    scientific theory (para. 92).  </p>

    Totten’s evidence, it would appear that had Dr. Totten’s studies and clinical
    work included members of the Malvern Crew, the trial judge would have admitted
    his evidence (para. 12).  In the course of explaining four possible ways in
    which the Crown could have adduced admissible expert evidence, the trial judge
    said at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The third possible way would be through a

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admissibility of Dr. Totten’s opinion as to the meaning of the
    respondent’s teardrop tattoo raised a difficult evidentiary problem for the
    trial judge.  On the one hand, gang culture and the murderous violence it
    promotes were unavoidably central features of the factual matrix of this trial. 
    On the other hand, the respondent could only be properly convicted if the Crown
    could prove his personal criminal responsibility in Mr. Peter’s death.  The
    respondent could not be convicted on the basis of his involvement in a violent
    gang culture.  In ruling on the admissibility of Dr. Totten’s evidence, the
    trial judge had to steer a course that would at once equip the jury with all
    relevant, reliable information available and needed to arrive at a correct
    verdict, while avoiding exposure to information that could invite a verdict
    based on the jury’s understandably negative reaction to those who were part of
    the gang culture:  see <i>R. v. J.-L.J.</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, at para. 61.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I think the trial judge, whose reasons reveal a detailed consideration
    of the issues raised by Dr. Totten’s proposed evidence, erred in excluding Dr.
    Totten’s evidence in its entirety.  Before turning to the errors in his
    analysis, I will address the general principles governing the admissibility of
    this kind of evidence.  I propose to outline an approach that I suggest may be
    helpful when assessing admissibility.  In doing so, I do not depart from the
    controlling jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Nor do I intend to
    suggest that the admissibility of expert opinion evidence should always be
    approached in the same way.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(a)       Delineating the Scope
    of the Expert’s Opinion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admissibility inquiry is not conducted in a vacuum.  Before deciding
    admissibility, a trial judge must determine the nature and scope of the
    proposed expert evidence.  In doing so, the trial judge sets not only the
    boundaries of the proposed expert evidence but also, if necessary, the language
    in which the expert’s opinion may be proffered so as to minimize any potential
    harm to the trial process.  A cautious delineation of the scope of the proposed
    expert evidence and strict adherence to those boundaries, if the evidence is
    admitted, are essential.  The case law demonstrates that overreaching by expert
    witnesses is probably the most common fault leading to reversals on appeal: 
    see, for example, <i>R. v. Ranger</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.); <i>R. v.
    Klymchuk</i> (2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 341 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. K. (A.)</i> <span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A determination of the scope of the proposed expert opinion evidence and
    the manner in which it may be presented to the jury if admissible will be made
    after a <i>voir dire</i>.  The procedures to be followed on that <i>voir dire</i> are for the trial judge to decide.  Sometimes the expert must be examined and
    cross-examined on the <i>voir dire</i> to ensure that the proposed evidence is
    properly understood.  At the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i>, the trial
    judge must identify with exactitude the scope of the proposed opinion that may
    be admissible.  He or she will also decide whether certain terminology used by
    the expert is unnecessary to the opinion and potentially misleading:  see <i>R.
    v. G.</i> (<i>P.) </i>(2009), 242 C.C.C. (3d) 558, at para. 16 (Ont. C.A.). 
    Admissibility is not an all or nothing proposition.<a href="#_ftn6"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> 
    Nor is the trial judge limited to either accepting or rejecting the opinion
    evidence as tendered by one party or the other.  The trial judge may admit part
    of the proffered testimony, modify the nature or scope of the proposed opinion,
    or edit the language used to frame that opinion:  see, for example,  <i>R. v.
    Wilson</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 294 (Ont. S.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The importance of properly defining the limits and nature of proposed
    expert opinion evidence and the language to be used by the expert is one of the
    valuable lessons learned from the Inquiry into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in
    Ontario.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> 
    That inquiry examined the forensic work of Dr. Charles Smith, who at the time
    was considered to be a leading pediatric pathologist in Ontario.  The inquiry
    determined that, among other failings, Dr. Smith often went beyond the limits
    of his expertise when offering opinions in his testimony.  His excesses were
    sometimes not caught by the court or counsel and, along with other
    shortcomings, led to several miscarriages of justice.  Goudge J.A., the
    Commissioner, stressed the trial judge’s obligation to take an active role in
    framing the scope and the language of the proposed expert opinion evidence.  He
    observed at pp. 499-500:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A final outcome from the admissibility process is a
    clear definition of the scope of the expertise that a particular witness is
    qualified to give.  As discussed in the earlier part of this chapter, <i>it
    will be beneficial to define the range of expertise with as much precision as
    possible so that all the parties and the witness are alerted to areas where the
    witness has not been qualified to give evidence. … As I earlier recommended,
    the trial judge should take steps at the outset to define clearly the proposed
    subject area of the witness’s expertise.  At the conclusion of the </i>voir
    dire<i>, the trial judge will be well situated to rule with precision on what
    the witness can and cannot say.</i>  These steps will help to ensure that the
    witness’s testimony, when given, can be confined to permissible areas and that
    it meets the requirement of threshold reliability.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The present case affords an example of the problem that can ensue when
    the proffered expert opinion evidence is not properly circumscribed.  In its
    primary position, the Crown contended that Dr. Totten’s opinion could be put
    before the jury in the form of a hypothetical, which, as the trial judge
    accurately observed, was “tantamount to a confession” (para. 92).  The Crown’s proposed
    formulation of Dr. Totten’s evidence drew a straight and powerful line between
    the jury’s acceptance of his opinion and the conviction of the respondent on a
    charge of first degree murder.  As advanced by the Crown in its primary
    position, Dr. Totten’s evidence reads less like the opinion of a sociologist on
    the meaning of a symbol used in a certain culture and more like evidence from a
    factual witness offering identification testimony:  see <i>U.S. v. Mejia</i>,
    545 F.3d 179 (2nd Cir. 2008), at pp. 195-96.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge acknowledged both the primary and
    alternative positions advanced by the Crown, but in his analysis focussed
    almost entirely on the Crown’s primary position.  For example, very early in
    his analysis (para. 25), he summarized Dr. Totten’s proposed evidence in these
    terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Dr. Totten concluded that Mr. Abbey’s tattoo was
    related to the murder of a rival gang member in 2004.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>References to Dr. Totten’s evidence going directly to the meaning of the
    respondent’s tattoo are found throughout the reasons.  In the concluding
    paragraph (para. 96), the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It would be an error to allow Dr. Totten to testify
    to the potential meanings of the teardrop tattoo on Mr. Abbey’s face and to
    present a ready-made inference concerning it to the jury.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>The close and strong connection
    urged by the Crown between Dr. Totten’s opinion and the ultimate issue of
    identification quite properly caused the trial judge to be concerned that if
    admitted, Dr. Totten’s evidence could usurp the jury’s fact-finding role on the
    ultimate issue in the trial:  <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at p. 24.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s attempt to link directly Dr. Totten’s opinion to the
    identity of the respondent as the killer misconceived the true nature of Dr.
    Totten’s opinion and the role he could legitimately play in assisting the
    jury.  His report and his evidence made it clear that he could not speak to the
    reason the respondent placed a teardrop tattoo on his face.  Dr. Totten could
    speak to the culture within urban street gangs in Canada and specifically the
    potential meanings to be taken from the inscription of a teardrop tattoo on the
    face of a young male member of that culture.  Dr. Totten’s evidence was
    directed to the potential meanings attributed to that symbol within a given
    culture and not to the reason any particular individual placed a tattoo on his
    face.  Properly understood, Dr. Totten’s opinion provided context within which
    to assess other evidence that the jury would hear, thereby assisting the jury
    in making its own assessment as to the meaning, if any, to be given to the
    respondent’s teardrop tattoo:  see David M. Paciocco &amp; Lee Stuesser, <i>The
    Law of Evidence</i>, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2008), at p. 209; Melvin M.
    Mark, “Social Science Evidence in the Courtroom:  Daubert and Beyond?” (1999) 5
    Psychol. Pub. Pol’y &amp; L. 175, at p. 187, n. 7.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s secondary position on the <i>voir dire</i> was described by
    the trial judge in these terms, at para. 28:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… Dr. Totten’s evidence could be limited to the
    introduction alone of the possible meanings for the tattoo without providing
    his analysis of the specific meaning attributable to Mr. Abbey’s tattoo.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This secondary position reflects the proper limits of the opinion that
    Dr. Totten could properly advance.  Phrased in this manner, his opinion did not
    go directly to the ultimate issue of identity and did not invite the jury to
    move directly from acceptance of the opinion to a finding of guilt.  Dr.
    Totten’s opinion, as properly delineated, would form part of a larger evidentiary
    picture to be evaluated as a whole by the jury.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(b)       The Applicable
    Principles and a Suggested Approach to Admissibility</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental to the adversary process that witnesses testify to
    what they saw, heard, felt or did, and the trier of fact, using that
    evidentiary raw material, determines the facts.  Expert opinion evidence is
    different.  Experts take information accumulated from their own work and
    experience, combine it with evidence offered by other witnesses, and present an
    opinion as to a factual inference that should be drawn from that material.  The
    trier of fact must then decide whether to accept or reject the expert’s opinion
    as to the appropriate factual inference.  Expert evidence has the real
    potential to swallow whole the fact-finding function of the court, especially
    in jury cases.  Consequently, expert opinion evidence is presumptively
    inadmissible.  The party tendering the evidence must establish its
    admissibility on the balance of probabilities:  Paciocco &amp; Stuesser at pp.
    184, 193; S. Casey Hill <i>et al.</i>, <i>McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal
    Evidence</i>, 4th ed., looseleaf (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2009), at
    para. 12:30.10.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The increased reliance on expert opinion evidence by both the Crown and
    defence in criminal matters is evident upon even a cursory review of the
    reported cases.  Sometimes it seems that a deluge of experts has descended on
    the criminal courts ready to offer definitive opinions to explain almost
    anything.  Expert evidence is particularly prevalent where inferences must be
    drawn from a wide variety of human behaviour:  see, for example, <i>R. v.
    McIntosh</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), at pp. 101-103, leave to appeal to
    S.C.C. refused <i>R. v. McCarthy</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. xii [leave sought by
    second appellant in <i>McIntosh</i>, Mr. McCarthy]; David M. Paciocco, “Coping
    With Expert Evidence About Human Behaviour” (1999) 25 Queen’s L.J. 305, at pp.
    307-308; S. Casey Hill <i>et al.</i> at para. 12:30.10; <i>R. v. Olscamp</i> (1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 466 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), approved in <i>R. v. Lance</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 438 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 24; Ontario, <i>The
    Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin: Report</i>, vol. 1
    (Toronto: Queen’s Printer, 1998), at pp. 311-24.  As Moldaver J.A. put it in <i>R.
    v. Clark</i> (2004), 69 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para. 107, a case involving
    the proposed expert evidence of a criminal profiler:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Combined, these two concerns [giving expert evidence
    more weight than it deserves and accepting expert evidence without subjecting
    it to the scrutiny it requires] raise the spectre of trial by expert as opposed
    to trial by jury.  That is something that must be avoided at all costs.  The
    problem is not a new one but in today’s day and age, with proliferation of
    expert evidence, it poses a constant threat.  <i>Vigilance is required to ensure
    that expert witnesses like Detective Inspector Lines are not allowed to hijack
    the trial and usurp the function of the jury.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite justifiable misgivings, expert opinion evidence is, of
    necessity, a mainstay in the litigation process.  Put bluntly, many cases,
    including very serious criminal cases, could not be tried without expert
    opinion evidence.  The judicial challenge is to properly control the
    admissibility of expert opinion evidence, the manner in which it is presented to
    the jury and the use that the jury makes of that evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The current approach to the admissibility of expert opinion evidence was
    articulated by Sopinka J. in <i>Mohan</i>.  Broadly speaking, <i>Mohan</i> replaced what had been a somewhat <i>laissez faire</i> attitude toward the
    admissibility of expert opinion evidence with a principled approach that
    required closer judicial scrutiny of the proffered evidence.  After <i>Mohan</i>,
    trial judges were required to assess the potential value of the evidence to the
    trial process against the potential harm to that process flowing from
    admission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The four criteria controlling the admissibility of expert opinion
    evidence identified in <i>Mohan</i> have achieved an almost canonical status in
    the law of evidence.  No judgment on the topic seems complete without reference
    to them.  The four criteria are:</p>

font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a properly qualified expert.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using these criteria, I suggest a two-step process for determining
    admissibility.  First, the party proffering the evidence must demonstrate the
    existence of certain preconditions to the admissibility of expert evidence. 
    For example, that party must show that the proposed witness is qualified to
    give the relevant opinion.  Second, the trial judge must decide whether expert
    evidence that meets the preconditions to admissibility is sufficiently
    beneficial to the trial process to warrant its admission despite the potential
    harm to the trial process that may flow from the admission of the expert
    evidence.  This “gatekeeper” component of the admissibility inquiry lies at the
    heart of the present evidentiary regime governing the admissibility of expert
    opinion evidence:  see <i>Mohan</i>; <i>R. v. D.D.</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275; <i>J.-L.J.</i>; <i>R. v. Trochym</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239; <i>K. (A.)</i>; <i>Ranger</i>; <i>R.
    v. Osmar</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused<span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I appreciate that <i>Mohan</i> does not describe the admissibility
    inquiry as a two-step process.  It does not distinguish between what I refer to
    as the preconditions to admissibility and the trial judge’s exercise of the
    “gatekeeper” function.  My description of the process as involving two distinct
    phases does not alter the substance of the analysis required by <i>Mohan</i>.  In
    suggesting a two-step approach, I mean only to facilitate the admissibility
    analysis and the application of the <i>Mohan</i> criteria.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is helpful to distinguish between what I describe as the
    preconditions to admissibility of expert opinion evidence and the performance
    of the “gatekeeper” function because the two are very different.  The inquiry
    into compliance with the preconditions to admissibility is a rules-based
    analysis that will yield “yes” or “no” answers.  Evidence that does not meet
    all of the preconditions to admissibility must be excluded and the trial judge
    need not address the more difficult and subtle considerations that arise in the
    “gatekeeper” phase of the admissibility inquiry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “gatekeeper” inquiry does not involve the application of bright line
    rules, but instead requires an exercise of judicial discretion.  The trial
    judge must identify and weigh competing considerations to decide whether on
    balance those considerations favour the admissibility of the evidence.  This
    cost-benefit analysis is case-specific and, unlike the first phase of the
    admissibility inquiry, often does not admit of a straightforward “yes” or “no”
    answer.  Different trial judges, properly applying the relevant principles in
    the exercise of their discretion, could in some situations come to different
    conclusions on admissibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In what I refer to as the first phase, four preconditions to
    admissibility must be established, none of which were in dispute at trial:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of explaining the analytic distinction I draw between
    the preconditions to admissibility and the “gatekeeper” function, I need not
    address the first three preconditions.  The relevance criterion, however, does
    require some explanation.  Relevance is one of the four <i>Mohan</i> criteria. 
    However, I use the word differently than Sopinka J. used it in <i>Mohan</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relevance can have two very different meanings in the evidentiary
    context.   Relevance can refer to logical relevance, a requirement that the
    evidence have a tendency as a matter of human experience and logic to make the
    existence or non-existence of a fact in issue more or less likely than it would
    be without that evidence:  <i>J.-L.J.</i> at para. 47.  Given this meaning,
    relevance sets a low threshold for admissibility and reflects the inclusionary
    bias of our evidentiary rules:  see <i>R. v. Clark</i> (1999), 129 C.C.C. (3d)
    1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 12.  Relevance can also refer to a requirement that
    evidence be not only logically relevant to a fact in issue, but also
    sufficiently probative to justify its admission despite the prejudice that may
    flow from its admission.  This meaning of relevance is described as legal
    relevance and involves a limited weighing of the costs and benefits associated
    with admitting evidence that is undoubtedly logically relevant:  see Paciocco
    &amp; Stuesser at pp. 30-35.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevance criterion for admissibility identified in <i>Mohan</i> refers to legal relevance.  To be relevant, the evidence must not only be
    logically relevant but must be sufficiently probative to justify admission: 
    see <i>Mohan</i> at pp. 20-21; <i>K. (A.)</i> at paras. 77-89; Paciocco &amp;
    Stuesser at pp. 198-99.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I speak of relevance as one of the preconditions to admissibility,
    I refer to logical relevance.  I think the evaluation of the probative value of
    the evidence mandated by the broader concept of legal relevance is best
    reserved for the “gatekeeper” phase of the admissibility analysis.  Evidence
    that is relevant in the sense that it is logically relevant to a fact in issue
    survives to the “gatekeeper” phase where the probative value can be assessed as
    part of a holistic consideration of the costs and benefits associated with
    admitting the evidence.  Evidence that does not meet the logical relevance
    criterion is excluded at the first stage of the inquiry: see e.g. <i>R. v.
    Dimitrov</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at para. 48, leave to appeal to
    S.C.C. refused (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) xvii.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My separation of logical relevance from the cost-benefit analysis
    associated with legal relevance does not alter the criteria for admissibility
    set down in <i>Mohan</i> or the underlying principles governing the
    admissibility inquiry.  I separate logical from legal relevance simply to
    provide an approach which focuses first on the essential prerequisites to
    admissibility and second, on all of the factors relevant to the exercise of the
    trial judge’s discretion in determining whether evidence that meets those
    preconditions should be received.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, it was not argued that Dr. Totten’s evidence did not
    meet the preconditions to admissibility.  Nor is it suggested that it was not
    logically relevant to identity, a fact in issue.  The battle over the
    admissibility of his evidence was fought at the “gatekeeper” stage of the
    analysis.  At that stage, the trial judge engages in a case-specific
    cost-benefit analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “benefit” side of the cost-benefit evaluation requires a
    consideration of the probative potential of the evidence and the significance
    of the issue to which the evidence is directed.  When one looks to potential
    probative value, one must consider the reliability of the evidence. 
    Reliability concerns reach not only the subject matter of the evidence, but
    also the methodology used by the proposed expert in arriving at his or her
    opinion, the expert’s expertise and the extent to which the expert is shown to
    be impartial and objective.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    the focus of much judicial attention, particularly where the expert advances
    what is purported to be scientific opinion:  see, for example, <i>Daubert v.
    Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.</i>, 509 U.S. 579 (1993); <i>J.-L.J.</i> at

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the potential benefit to the trial process flowing from the
    admission of the evidence, the trial judge must intrude into territory
    customarily the exclusive domain of the jury in a criminal jury trial.  The
    trial judge’s evaluation is not, however, the same as the jury’s ultimate
    assessment.  The trial judge is deciding only whether the evidence is worthy of
    being heard by the jury and not the ultimate question of whether the evidence
    should be accepted and acted upon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “cost” side of the ledger addresses the various risks inherent in
    the admissibility of expert opinion evidence, described succinctly by Binnie J.
    in <i>J.-L.J.</i> at para. 47 as “consumption of time, prejudice and
    confusion”.  Clearly, the most important risk is the danger that a jury will be
    unable to make an effective and critical assessment of the evidence.  The
    complexity of the material underlying the opinion, the expert’s impressive
    credentials, the impenetrable jargon in which the opinion is wrapped and the
    cross-examiner’s inability to expose the opinion’s shortcomings may prevent an
    effective evaluation of the evidence by the jury.  There is a risk that a jury
    faced with a well presented firm opinion may abdicate its fact-finding role on
    the understandable assumption that a person labelled as an expert by the trial
    judge knows more about his or her area of expertise than do the individual
    members of the jury:  <i>J.-L.J.</i> at para. 25.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the risk that the jury will yield its fact finding
    function, expert opinion evidence can also compromise the trial process by
    unduly protracting and complicating proceedings.  Unnecessary and excessive
    resort to expert evidence can also give a distinct advantage to the party with
    the resources to hire the most and best experts – often the Crown in a criminal
    proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the risks described above will not inevitably arise in every case
    where expert evidence is offered.  Nor will the risks have the same force in
    every case.  For example, in this case, I doubt that the jury would have
    difficulty critically evaluating Dr. Totten’s opinion.  There was nothing
    complex or obscure about his methodology, the material he relied on in forming
    his opinion or the language in which he framed and explained his opinion.  As
    when measuring the benefits flowing from the admission of expert evidence, the
    trial judge as “gatekeeper” must go beyond truisms about the risks inherent in
    expert evidence and come to grips with those risks as they apply to the
    particular circumstances of the individual case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cost-benefit analysis demands a consideration of the extent to which
    the proffered opinion evidence is necessary to a proper adjudication of the
    fact(s) to which that evidence is directed.  In <i>Mohan</i>, Sopinka J.
    describes necessity as a separate criterion governing admissibility.  I see the
    necessity analysis as a part of the larger cost-benefit analysis performed by
    the trial judge.  In relocating the necessity analysis, I do not, however,
    depart from the role assigned to necessity by the <i>Mohan</i> criteria.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems self-evident that an expert opinion on an issue that the jury
    is fully equipped to decide without that opinion is unnecessary and should
    register a “zero” on the “benefit” side of the cost-benefit scale.  Inevitably,
    expert opinion evidence that brings no added benefit to the process will be
    excluded:  see, for example, <i>R. v. Batista</i> (2008), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 97
    (Ont. C.A.), at paras. <span lang=FR-CA>45-47; <i>R. v. Nahar</i> (2004), 181
    C.C.C. (3d) 449 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. </span>20-21.  Opinion evidence that is
    essential to a jury’s ability to understand and evaluate material evidence will
    register high on the “benefit” side of the scale.  However, the ultimate
    admissibility of the opinion, even where it is essential, will depend on not
    only its potential benefit, but on the potential prejudice to the trial process
    associated with its admission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In many cases, the proffered opinion evidence will fall somewhere
    between the essential and the unhelpful.  In those cases, the trial judge’s
    assessment of the extent to which the evidence could assist the jury will be
    one of the factors to be weighed in deciding whether the benefits flowing from
    admission are sufficiently strong to overcome the costs associated with
    admission.  In addressing the extent to which the opinion evidence is
    necessary, the trial judge will have regard to other facets of the trial
    process –such as the jury instruction – that may provide the jury with the
    tools necessary to adjudicate properly on the fact in issue without the
    assistance of expert evidence:  <i>D.D. </i>at para. 33; <i>R. v. Bonisteel</i> (2008), 236 C.C.C. (3d) 170 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 69.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to explore the necessity requirement in any greater
    detail.  The trial judge appears to have accepted defence counsel’s concession
    that Dr. Totten’s evidence was necessary in the sense that the meaning of a
    teardrop tattoo was outside of the ordinary knowledge of a Toronto juror (para.
    34).  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(c)       Application of the
    Principles to this Case</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s decision to exclude Dr. Totten’s evidence was the
    product of his cost-benefit analysis.  That assessment is entitled to deference
    on appeal:  <i>D.D.</i> at para. 13; <i>Bonisteel</i> at para. 70.  In my view,
    however, the trial judge made five legal errors in his analysis.  First, he did
    not properly delineate the nature and scope of Dr. Totten’s evidence before
    addressing its admissibility.  Second, in testing the reliability of Dr.
    Totten’s proposed opinion evidence, the trial judge relied almost exclusively
    on concepts and criteria that were inappropriate to the assessment of the
    reliability of Dr. Totten’s opinion while failing to consider the criteria that
    were relevant.  Third, in examining the methods used by Dr. Totten to enhance
    the reliability of his opinion, the trial judge imposed too high a standard of
    reliability, misapprehended parts of Dr. Totten’s evidence and considered
    evidence that was irrelevant to the reliability of the opinion.  Fourth, in
    assessing the reliability of Dr. Totten’s opinion, the trial judge went beyond
    questions of threshold reliability and considered features of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence that should have been left to the jury in their ultimate assessment of
    that evidence.  Fifth, the trial judge erred in holding that because Dr.
    Totten’s opinion had not been peer reviewed, it followed that his opinion was
    not based on proven facts and could not be admitted into evidence.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(d)       The Nature and Scope
    of Dr. Totten’s Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I outlined Dr. Totten’s evidence above (see Part III (iv)).  The trial
    judge directed virtually the entirety of his admissibility analysis to the
    Crown’s primary position, which would have had Dr. Totten testifying as to the
    meaning of the respondent’s teardrop tattoo.  I have already indicated that
    position was not consistent with the substance of Dr. Totten’s evidence or his
    reports.  Dr. Totten could not speak directly to the reasons the respondent had
    put a teardrop tattoo on his face.  But, he could offer an opinion based on his
    research, clinical experience and review of the relevant literature as to the
    meaning ascribed to a teardrop tattoo within the urban street gang culture, a
    community to which the respondent admittedly belonged.  The Crown’s alternative
    position was consistent with the scope of Dr. Totten’s evidence and expertise.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difference between an opinion on why the respondent put the teardrop
    tattoo on his face and an opinion on the meanings of that symbol in the street
    gang culture in which the respondent lived is much more than semantical.  The
    former speaks directly to the issue of the murderer’s identity.  That opinion,
    if heard, invites the jury to move directly from accepting Dr. Totten’s
    evidence to a finding of guilt.  The latter opinion speaks on a much more
    general level and provides context in which the evidence of other witnesses,
    who can speak more directly to the facts of the case, can be placed and
    assessed.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    distinction between the proper scope of Dr. Totten’s evidence and the scope as
    primarily advanced by the Crown and considered by the trial judge is not unlike
    the distinction drawn in <i>K. (A.)</i>.  In that case, Charron J.A. dealt with
    expert evidence relating to the behaviour of children who had allegedly been
    abused.  As she explained, the experts in that case could not testify that
    certain features of a child’s behaviour demonstrated that the child had been
    abused.  In other words, the experts could not forge a direct link between
    their observations and prior abuse of the complainant.  However, those experts
    could testify for the limited purpose of explaining that certain kinds of
    behaviour have been commonly observed in victims of child abuse.  That kind of
    expert evidence was admissible because it provided the jury with a more
    complete picture when assessing the entirety of the evidence and, in
    particular, when deciding what inferences or conclusions should be drawn from
    the post-event behaviour of the complainants:  see also <i>R. v. Bernardo</i> (1995), 42 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 96 (Ont. Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)); <i>R. v. F.
    (D.S.)</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 50-52.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge, no doubt influenced by the Crown’s primary position, failed to properly
    limit the scope of Dr. Totten’s opinion.  He addressed the question of
    admissibility on the assumption that Dr. Totten would speak directly to the
    reason the respondent had put a teardrop tattoo on his face.  The trial judge’s
    only reference to the merits of the Crown’s alternative position in the course
    of his 96-paragraph decision appears in the last sentence of the last paragraph
    where he states “the same reliability concerns are present in either form of
    the proposed expert evidence”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree
    with this assessment.  Had the trial judge limited Dr. Totten’s opinion to the
    potential meanings of the tattoo within the street gang culture, Dr. Totten
    would not have testified about the meaning of the respondent’s tattoo.  His
    evidence could not be described as “tantamount to a confession” (para. 1).  Nor
    would Dr. Totten’s evidence “present a ready-made inference concerning it [the
    meaning of the tattoo]” (para. 96).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Properly
    limited, Dr. Totten’s evidence took a first, albeit important, step toward
    establishing the Crown’s position that the respondent’s teardrop tattoo
    signified that he had killed Mr. Peter.  Standing alone, however, the evidence
    could not make the Crown’s case with respect to the meaning of the tattoo.  I
    see no significant risk that the jury, having heard Dr. Totten’s opinion in its
    properly limited form, would have moved directly from accepting that opinion to
    a conviction of the respondent.  One must bear in mind that if Dr. Totten’s
    evidence was admitted, he would have been cross-examined.  No doubt, his ready
    acknowledgement that he could not speak directly to the respondent’s reasons
    for putting a tattoo on his face would be front and centre in that
    cross-examination.  Had the trial judge limited the scope of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence along the lines proposed by the Crown in its alternative position, the
    cost-benefit analysis required by the case law may well have yielded a
    different result.       </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During Dr.
    Totten’s evidence and the argument following his evidence, the trial judge
    continually referred to the reliability factors identified in <i>Daubert</i>,
    the leading American authority, which is approvingly referred to in the Supreme
    Court of Canada’s decision in <i>J.-L.J.</i>  In numerous lengthy dialogues
    with Crown counsel, the trial judge repeatedly challenged the Crown to
    establish the reliability of Dr. Totten’s opinion using the <i>Daubert</i> factors.  Those factors include the existence of measurable error rates, peer
    review of results, the use of random sampling and the ability of the tester to
    replicate his or her results.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    reasons for excluding Dr. Totten’s evidence, the trial judge treated the
    evidence as advancing a “novel scientific theory” (para. 38) put forward to
    “scientifically prove that Mr. Abbey’s tattoo means he killed Simeon Peter”
    (para. 92).  Having set Dr. Totten’s opinion up as a scientific theory, the
    trial judge then tested the reliability of that theory as if it had been put
    forward as the product of an inquiry based on the scientific method.  The trial
    judge’s reasons are replete with references to the absence of error rates
    (paras. 56-59, 62-64), the failure to use random sampling (paras. 56-59), the
    absence of peer review of Dr. Totten’s conclusions (para. 78) and the absence
    of any attempt to replicate Dr. Totten’s findings (para. 78).  It is clear that
    the trial judge viewed the absence of the factors identified in <i>Daubert</i> as fatal to the reliability of Dr. Totten’s evidence.  He said at para. 78:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… without evidence on the rate of error, a peer
    review of his conclusions, or the replication of his findings, I am not
    satisfied that Dr. Totten’s conclusion is not flawed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extent
    to which the <i>Daubert</i> factors dominated the trial judge’s reliability
    analysis can be seen in the following passage from his reasons (para. 56):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>One of the problems with accepting his methodology
    is that the common <i>indicia</i> of reliable, replicable, scientific studies
    are not present (nor could they be according to Dr. Totten) in his qualitative
    research.  In order to generalize and extrapolate Dr. Totten’s findings, or use
    his theory as a diagnostic tool, <i>I should have some knowledge about the
    statistical probability of the accuracy of his conclusions.  To that end, his
    conclusions should be tested by applying them to a random sample of the
    population of street gangs who wear teardrop tattoos to see if his conclusion
    can be falsified.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    passage mischaracterizes Dr. Totten’s evidence as presenting a “theory” to be
    used as a “diagnostic tool”.  This language, taken from the leading authority
    of <i>J.-L.J.</i>, does not fit Dr. Totten’s evidence.  I also do not
    understand the meaning of the reference to “random samples of the population of
    street gangs who wear teardrop tattoos”.  The persons interviewed by Dr. Totten
    were randomly selected in the sense that he did not seek out particular gang
    members.  They were not randomly selected in the sense that Dr. Totten
    specifically excluded persons who had a strong motive to mislead him.  It may
    be that the trial judge was simply saying that Dr. Totten’s conclusions could
    have been tested through additional interviews with more street gang members
    from different gangs all of whom had teardrop tattoos.  One cannot disagree
    that interviews with more gang members who had teardrop tattoos would have
    assisted in weighing Dr. Totten’s opinion.  However, that process is not the
    same as the process of random sampling as that term is used in the application
    of the scientific method.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not
    surprising that Dr. Totten’s opinion could not pass scientific muster.  While
    his research, and hence his opinion, could be regarded as scientific in the
    very broad sense of that word, as used in <i>McIntosh</i>, Dr. Totten did not
    pretend to employ the scientific method and did not depend on adherence to that
    methodology for the validity of his conclusions.  As his opinion was not the
    product of scientific inquiry, its reliability did not rest on its scientific
    validity.  Dr. Totten’s opinion flowed from his specialized knowledge gained
    through extensive research, years of clinical work and his familiarity with the
    relevant academic literature.  It was unhelpful to assess Dr. Totten’s evidence
    against factors that were entirely foreign to his methodology.  As Professors
    Sales and Shuman put it in their text, <i>Experts in Court: Reconciling Law,
    Science, and Professional Knowledge</i>, at pp. 74-75:  “[f]or non-scientific
    expert testimony, scientific validity is an oxymoron.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scientific
    validity is not a condition precedent to the admissibility of expert opinion
    evidence.  Most expert evidence routinely heard and acted upon in the courts
    cannot be scientifically validated. For example, psychiatrists testify to the
    existence of various mental states, doctors testify as to the cause of an injury
    or death, accident reconstructionists testify to the location or cause of an
    accident, economists or rehabilitation specialists testify to future employment
    prospects and future care costs, fire marshals testify about the cause of a
    fire, professionals from a wide variety of fields testify as to the operative
    standard of care in their profession or the cause of a particular event.  Like
    Dr. Totten, these experts do not support their opinions by reference to error
    rates, random samplings or the replication of test results.  Rather, they refer
    to specialized knowledge gained through experience and specialized training in
    the relevant field.  To test the reliability of the opinion of these experts
    and Dr. Totten using reliability factors referable to scientific validity is to
    attempt to place the proverbial square peg into the round hole.<a href="#_ftn9"

    exclusively against the <i>Daubert</i> factors, much of the expert evidence
    routinely accepted and acted upon in courts would be excluded despite its
    obvious reliability and value to the trial process.  However, <i>Daubert</i> does not suggest that the factors it proposes are essential to the reliability
    inquiry.  Instead, <i>Daubert</i>, at p. 484, describes that inquiry as “a
    flexible one”.  This flexibility was subsequently emphasized in <i>Kumho Tire
    Co. v. Carmichael</i>, 526 U.S. 137 (1999).  Unlike <i>Daubert</i>, <i>Kumho
    Tire Co. </i>did not involve an opinion, the validity of which relied upon the

    some kinds of expert testimony.  The court observed at p. 150:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> … In other cases, the relevant reliability concerns

    General that “the factors identified in <i>Daubert</i> may or may not be
    pertinent in assessing reliability, depending on the nature of the issue, the

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An example
    of the flexible approach to the assessment of reliability favoured in <i>Daubert</i> and <i>Kumho Tire Co. </i>is found in <i>U.S. v. Hankey</i>, 203 F.3d 1160 (9th
    Cir. 2000), a case involving expert evidence regarding gangs.  There, the
    prosecution offered expert opinion evidence through a long-time undercover
    police officer of the “code of silence” that operated within the culture of
    certain urban street gangs.  After referring to <i>Kumho Tire Co.</i> and the
    need to assess reliability by <i>indicia</i> that are relevant to the
    particular expertise advanced, the court said at p. 1169:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Given the type of expert testimony proffered by the
    government, it is difficult to imagine that the court could have been more
    diligent in assessing relevance and reliability.  <i>The </i>Daubert<i> factors
    (peer review, publication, potential error rate, etc.) simply are not
    applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily on the
    knowledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory
    behind it.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    Canadian trial courts have reached a similar conclusion and admitted expert
    evidence about various features of gang culture relevant to the particular
    prosecution, see <i>e.g.</i> <i>R. v. Wilson</i>;  <i>R. v. H.J.H.</i>, [2002]
    B.C.J. No. 3103 (S.C.); <i>R. v. Grant</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 5891 (S.C.);  <i>R.

    caution against the inappropriate use of the <i>Daubert</i> factors to assess
    the reliability of expert opinion evidence can be found in Canadian commentary. 
    Professor Paciocco has observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Clearly it is inappropriate to consider all
    expertise as science, or to require all expertise to attain the scientific
    method.  Some expert witnesses rely on science only in a loose sense. 
    Actuaries apply probability theory and mathematics to produce decidedly
    unscientific results.  Appraisers make subjective assessments of objective
    data, as do family assessment experts.  Professionals testifying to standards
    of care within their profession are doing nothing scientific.  Yet Daubert<i> spawned a jurisprudence that was fixated for a time with science.  This led
    lower courts to commit two kinds of error.</i>  First, it caused some lower
    courts to hold that the <i>Daubert</i> test and the gatekeeping role is
    confined to scientific expertise.  Experts who were not scientists would not be
    subjected to the reliability inquiry prescribed by <i>Daubert</i>.  <i>Second,
    it caused other courts to apply the criteria listed in </i>Daubert<i> in a
    wooden fashion, even to non-scientific forms of expertise.</i>  Each of these
    two kinds of errors was caused by the failure to take context into account.<a

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Forensic pathology provides a good example of a

    rates of error.  The reasons are obvious: testing and reproducibility cannot be

    instead rely on specialized training, accepted standards and protocols within

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge mischaracterized Dr. Totten’s opinion as involving a novel scientific
    theory.  It was not scientific.  It was not novel.  And it was not a theory. 
    Dr. Totten’s opinion was based on knowledge he had acquired about a particular
    culture through years of academic study, interaction in various ways with
    members of that culture and review of the relevant literature.  He spoke to the
    meaning, as he understood it from his knowledge, of certain symbols within that
    culture.  Dr. Totten’s evidence could no more be regarded as a “scientific

    litigation process?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    significance of testing the expert’s methodologies against those accepted in
    the field was highlighted in <i>Kumho Tire Co.</i> at p. 152:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The objective of that requirement [the gatekeeper
    function] is to ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony.  <i>It
    is to make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon professional
    studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of
    intellectual rigour that characterizes the practice of an expert in the
    relevant field.  </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The study
    of cultural mores within particular communities or groups in a community is a
    well-recognized field of study within the broader academic and professional
    disciplines of sociology, criminology and anthropology.  Dr. Totten’s expertise
    in this particular field was acknowledged by all involved in this case.  There
    was no challenge to the manner in which Dr. Totten gathered the relevant data. 
    By that I mean it was not suggested that the information he looked to had not
    been accurately recorded and memorialized by those involved in the various
    studies.  These three features of his evidence should have factored into the
    trial judge’s assessment of the threshold reliability of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence.  They were not.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten
    testified at length about the techniques and methods he used in his research to
    assemble and verify the information he ultimately drew on to advance his
    opinion.  While acknowledging that he could not ensure that all the information
    he received from gang members was accurate, he explained the various methods
    used in an attempt to maximize the veracity of the information received.  Dr.
    Totten testified that the methodology he followed was well established within
    his field of study and was entirely consistent with the methods used by others
    conducting the same kind of research.  For example, Dr. Totten explained
    several ways in which the concept of peer review was used in his field.  His
    studies were all peer reviewed using those techniques.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge, as he was entitled to do, made his own assessment of the effectiveness
    of some of the specific techniques used by Dr. Totten to enhance the
    reliability of the information he received in his studies.  However, the trial
    judge should have taken into account in his threshold reliability assessment
    the unchallenged evidence that Dr. Totten’s work was done in accordance with
    the established and accepted methodology used in his field.  Dr. Totten, by
    employing “the same level of intellectual rigour” (<i>Kumho Tire Co. </i>at p.
    152) when advancing his opinion in the courtroom that he and his colleagues used
    in the course of their practice, enhanced the threshold reliability of the
    opinion based on that work.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two other
    factors not mentioned by the trial judge were potentially important to the
    reliability assessment.  First, Dr. Totten drew his conclusions from data
    gathered in research studies that had no connection to this case.  There was no
    chance that in gathering the relevant information, Dr. Totten sought, consciously
    or subconsciously, to lend his expertise to one side of the legal controversy. 
    “Confirmation bias” was not an issue.  It cannot be suggested that Dr. Totten
    set out to confirm an existing belief about the meaning of teardrop tattoos
    when he conducted his research.  Dr. Totten’s neutrality when he gathered the
    information he ultimately looked to to form the relevant opinion distinguishes
    his evidence from that of experts who are sought out to generate information
    for the purposes of litigation, or those who come to a case with firmly held
    preconceived notions that place the expert firmly on one side of the
    controversy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    neither the methodology used by Dr. Totten nor his opinion concerning the
    teardrop tattoos were complex or difficult for the layperson to understand and
    evaluate.  I have no doubt that the methods Dr. Totten employed, the data those
    methods produced and his opinion based on those data could be critically
    evaluated and independently assessed by a jury.  This was not rocket science.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am
    satisfied that the factors outlined above, taken in combination, offer a firm basis
    upon which a trial judge could conclude that Dr. Totten’s opinion, that the
    inscription of a teardrop tattoo on the face of a young male gang member
    carried one of three possible meanings within the urban gang culture, was
    sufficiently reliable to justify its admission.  Unfortunately, the trial judge
    did not address these factors but focused almost exclusively on the <i>Daubert</i> factors, which, for the reasons I have explained, had no relevance to the
    reliability of Dr. Totten’s evidence.</p>
  <p><b>(3)  Further Errors in the
    Reliability Assessment</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to using inapplicable reliability factors and failing to consider
    applicable ones, the trial judge made errors in his assessment of the methods used
    by Dr. Totten to enhance the reliability of his data.  Most significantly, the
    trial judge applied too high a standard in determining whether those methods
    provided sufficient reliability to clear the threshold reliability
    requirement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge accepted that some of Dr. Totten’s methods, for example triangulation,
    could enhance the reliability of the information given to him by the
    interviewed gang members (para. 81).  The trial judge ultimately concluded,
    however, that the methods used by Dr. Totten were “not unassailable” (para. 85)
    and were “far from foolproof” (para. 84).  In so holding, the trial judge
    appears to have required the Crown to demonstrate that the methods used by Dr.
    Totten produced information that was proven to be entirely accurate.  For
    example, after referring to investigative discourse analysis, one of the tools
    used by Dr. Totten and others in his field, the trial judge said, at para. 84:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…  There still exists <i>the probability</i> that
    some of Dr. Totten’s research subjects <i>may have been deceitful on many
    subjects unknown to him.</i>  That deceit would dramatically skew his results
    and sample size.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    think that in any field of study where the expert depends on information
    received from other individuals, there will inevitably be “a probability” that
    some of those individuals “may have been deceitful” about something in the
    course of the information gathering process.  If this is the standard demanded
    before opinion evidence based on information received from individuals can be
    admitted, one must wonder how evidence from psychiatrists and psychologists
    based on information gathered from an accused, his friends and family is ever
    deemed sufficiently reliable to warrant its admission.  That evidence is, of
    course, routinely received and used in criminal trials.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown
    was not required to demonstrate on the <i>voir dire</i> that the information
    relied on by Dr. Totten was accurate.  The Crown was required to demonstrate
    that there were sufficient <i>indicia</i> of reliability to warrant placing an
    opinion based on that information before the jury so that it could make the
    ultimate determination on the reliability of that information and the validity
    of the opinion based on it.  The probability that some part of the wealth of
    material relied on by Dr. Totten may have been inaccurate was not enough to
    keep his opinion from the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not only
    did the trial judge test the informational basis for Dr. Totten’s opinion
    against too exacting a standard, he also misapprehended parts of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence.  When explaining why he regarded the absence of error rates to be a very
    significant factor in assessing the reliability of Dr. Totten’s opinion, the
    trial judge expressed concern about the risk of “false positives” in Dr.
    Totten’s research.  The trial judge explained (at para. 64):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The possibility of occasions occurring when an
    individual wearing a teardrop tattoo fits the profile of a murderer but has in
    reality killed no one should be expressed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    observation demonstrates a misapprehension of Dr. Totten’s evidence.  Dr.
    Totten interviewed 300 gang members.  Ninety-seven had been convicted of
    homicide related offences.  Of that group of 97, 71 had teardrop tattoos.  All
    71 explained that their teardrop tattoo represented the murder of a rival gang
    member.  Dr. Totten’s opinion as to the potential meaning of a teardrop tattoo
    was based in part on the explanation offered by persons who had a teardrop
    tattoo and who had been convicted of a homicide related offence.  The
    convictions for homicide related offences of 71 people with teardrop tattoos lent
    some credibility to their explanation for the reason behind the teardrop
    tattoo.  Dr. Totten made no attempt to fit individuals with teardrop tattoos
    into “the profile of a murderer”.  Language referring to profiling by experts
    is used in some of the expert opinion case law, but has no application to Dr.
    Totten’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge also misapprehended Dr. Totten’s evidence as it related to the potential
    motive of the gang members interviewed to deny any involvement in criminal
    activity.  The trial judge determined that the reliability of Dr. Totten’s
    opinion suffered because of the very real possibility that gang members he
    interviewed would have a motive to conceal involvement in criminal activity
    (paras. 82, 83).  The trial judge explained that because Dr. Totten told
    interviewees that he may be obliged to disclose criminal conduct revealed by
    them, the interviewees would be reluctant to disclose criminal activity.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is
    no denying the logic of the trial judge’s analysis.  In respect of some of the
    information gathered by Dr. Totten, there was a very real motive to conceal the
    truth from Dr. Totten.  I do not see, however, how any motive to lie could have
    a negative effect on the information pertinent to Dr. Totten’s opinion in this
    case.  First of all, any lies told to Dr. Totten by persons who did not have
    teardrop tattoos were irrelevant for the purposes of his opinion.  That opinion
    rested in part on the explanation given for the teardrop tattoo by all 71 of
    the interviewed gang members who both had tattoos and had been convicted of a
    homicide related offence.  Their responses, linking their teardrop tattoos with
    the murders of rival gang members, could not have been motivated by a desire to
    avoid criminal liability.  The only persons interviewed who had teardrop
    tattoos and who might have had a motive to lie to avoid incriminating
    themselves in a homicide were the 10 gang members who had teardrop tattoos, but
    did not have homicide related convictions.  None of those gang members suggested
    that the teardrop tattoo represented involvement in a homicide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the
    trial judge’s hypothesis, some or all of these 10 gang members may have lied
    about the meaning of their teardrop tattoo to avoid implicating themselves in
    the murder of a rival gang member.  If any of the 10 lied for that reason,
    however, their lie does not undermine the validity of Dr. Totten’s opinion that
    the murder of a rival gang member is one explanation for a teardrop tattoo, but
    would instead confirm that opinion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    also misapprehended Dr. Totten’s evidence concerning the possibility that
    individuals who were not gang members would place a teardrop tattoo on their
    face as a fashion statement or to pose as persons living the gangster
    lifestyle.  The trial judge said (at para. 66) that Dr. Totten:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>was quite adamant in eliminating the possibility
    that ‘wannabees’ or ‘poseurs’ may have a teardrop inscribed on their face in
    order to portray a sense of dangerousness or false identity with a gang.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not
    read Dr. Totten’s evidence that way.  He readily acknowledged the “wannabee”
    and “poseur” phenomena.  Dr. Totten agreed that gang symbols had found their
    way into the more mainstream culture and that non-gang members used them
    without regard to their meanings within the gang culture.  However, Dr. Totten
    went on to testify, correctly, that the respondent was not a “poseur” or
    “wannabee”, but was a gang member.  He opined that a gang member would not
    likely misuse the symbols of the gang to which he belonged lest he face the
    gang’s retribution.  Dr. Totten’s evidence offers an explanation that could be
    accepted by a jury for discounting the possibility that an admitted gang member
    would misuse the symbols.  That reasoning is mischaracterized as a refusal to
    acknowledge that “wannabees” and “poseurs” use gang symbols. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    misapprehension of Dr. Totten’s evidence occurred when the trial judge referred
    to that evidence as “fairly equivocal” on the issue of whether Dr. Totten could
    speak directly to the meaning of the respondent’s teardrop tattoo without
    interviewing the respondent.  On a fair reading of the entirety of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence and the contents of his reports, it cannot be said that he
    equivocated.  Dr. Totten acknowledged throughout that the meaning of an individual’s
    tattoo could only be definitively determined by speaking with that individual.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further
    misapprehension of Dr. Totten’s evidence occurred when the trial judge
    addressed his evidence concerning the applicability of American studies to
    Canadian urban street gangs.  According to the trial judge, Dr. Totten was
    content to conclude that Canadian research was applicable in the United States
    “because he has often been asked to present at American sociology conferences”
    (para. 88).  Speaking at academic conferences in the United States would offer
    scant support for Dr. Totten’s opinion that research in the two countries had
    cross-border application.  In fact, Dr. Totten testified that his belief with
    respect to the applicability of American research was based on his own
    extensive experience with American street gangs in Chicago and his detailed
    review of the American literature.  This is a much firmer basis for the opinion
    than was acknowledged by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to misapprehending parts of Dr. Totten’s evidence, the trial judge
    took into account what I consider to be an irrelevant part of that evidence. 
    The trial judge held (at para. 68) that Dr. Totten’s “theoretical model” did
    not allow for instances where there were multiple shooters of a rival gang
    member and not all of those shooters were entitled to wear a teardrop tattoo.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Totten
    was not advancing a “theoretical model” of anything in his evidence.  More to
    the specific point, the question of who among multiple shooters should,
    according to gang rules, get credit for a killing and have the right to
    inscribe a teardrop tattoo on his face had nothing to do with Dr. Totten’s
    opinion concerning the meaning of a teardrop tattoo in the urban street gang
    culture.  The manner in which a particular individual involved in a killing was
    selected as the person entitled to wear the teardrop tattoo would not alter the
    fact that the individual who had the teardrop tattoo earned it by killing a
    rival gang member.  </p>
  <p><b>(4) The Distinction Between Threshold
    Reliability and Ultimate Reliability</b> </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    performing the “gatekeeper” function, a trial judge of necessity engages in an
    evaluation that shares some of the features with the evaluation ultimately
    performed by the jury if the evidence is admitted.  The trial judge is,
    however, charged only with the responsibility to decide whether the evidence is
    sufficiently reliable to merit its consideration by the jury.  The integrity of
    the trial process requires that the trial judge not overstep this function and
    encroach onto the jury’s territory.  In assessing threshold reliability, I
    think trial judges should be concerned with factors that are fundamental to the
    reliability of the opinion offered and responsive to the specific dangers posed
    by expert opinion evidence.  Trial judges, in assessing threshold reliability,
    should not be concerned with those factors which, while relevant to the
    ultimate reliability of the evidence, are common with those relevant to the
    evaluation of evidence provided by witnesses other than experts.  For example,
    I would not think that inconsistencies in an expert’s testimony, save perhaps
    in extreme cases, would ever justify keeping the expert’s opinion from the
    jury.  Juries are perfectly able to consider the impact of inconsistencies on
    the reliability of a witness’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this
    case, the trial judge focused on what he considered to be several
    inconsistencies in Dr. Totten’s evidence in deciding whether that evidence met
    the threshold reliability inquiry.  In doing so, I think he went beyond the
    bounds of that inquiry.  Those inconsistencies may or may not have been
    significant to the jury’s ultimate evaluation, but I do not think they had any
    role to play in the trial judge’s analysis.  I will refer to four of the inconsistencies
    emphasized by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge decided that Dr. Totten gave inconsistent evidence concerning the timing
    of the inscription of a teardrop tattoo by a person who had killed a rival gang
    member.  Initially, during examination-in-chief, Dr. Totten indicated that the
    tattoo could be inscribed “a couple of months after the murder”.  Later, but
    still in his examination-in-chief, Dr. Totten talked about “three or four
    months to a year”.  Still, later, he described the timing as depending on a
    variety of factors.  These answers are different and perhaps inconsistent with
    each other.  However, the differences could well be regarded as
    inconsequential.  Certainly, they have nothing to do with the core opinion
    advanced by Dr. Totten concerning the meanings of a teardrop tattoo.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge characterized Dr. Totten’s evidence about the population of street gangs
    as “inconsistent” (para. 63).  He testified that the population of street gangs
    in Canada was unknown and difficult to isolate with any accuracy.  Dr. Totten
    later offered an estimate of the total gang population in Canada.  I have
    difficulty seeing any inconsistency in these two answers.  In any event, if
    there is an inconsistency, it is not such as would affect the threshold reliability
    of his evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge compared portions of Dr. Totten’s evidence to various comments in the
    authoritative academic literature and found several conflicts, which the trial
    judge used in assessing threshold reliability (paras. 75, 76).  I count nine
    examples of inconsistencies referred to by the trial judge.  Some were
    picayune.  For example, Dr. Totten said the tattoo could refer to the death of
    a family member or a gang member whereas one of the authors reported that it
    could also refer to the death of a good friend.  Some of the other
    inconsistencies identified by the trial judge were not inconsistencies.  For
    example, the trial judge referred to comments by several authors to the effect
    that only the wearer of a tattoo knew the reason for the tattoo.  This is
    entirely consistent with Dr. Totten’s evidence and his reports.  Some of the
    other differences between Dr. Totten’s evidence and excerpts from the academic
    literature were overstated by the trial judge.  For example, one author had written
    that the teardrop tattoo may have lost its traditional meaning among young
    members of Hispanic gangs in California.  The trial judge read this single
    qualification on the symbolic meaning of the tattoo as completely undermining
    Dr. Totten’s opinion that the teardrop tattoo had common meanings among urban
    street gangs in North America.  The reporting by another expert of a single
    anomaly does not, in my view, necessarily undermine Dr. Totten’s evidence.  At
    its highest, it suggests some potential controversy among authorities,
    certainly fodder for cross-examination but no reason to exclude Dr. Totten’s
    evidence.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(f)  Peer Review and Proof of
    the Facts Underlying an Opinion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge concluded that Dr. Totten’s opinion was unreliable in part because it was
    not based on proven facts.  He said at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Dr. Totten conceded that his conclusions concerning
    the results have not been peer reviewed by other criminologists or
    sociologists.  As a consequence, it cannot be held that his opinion is based on
    proved facts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Totten’s research was peer reviewed, as that phrase is used and understood in
    the field of sociological research.  In any event, I cannot see a connection
    between peer review and proof of the facts upon which Dr. Totten’s opinion was
    based.  Some of the facts relevant to his opinion were agreed upon.  For
    example, it was agreed that the respondent was a gang member, that the murder
    of Mr. Peter was gang related and that the respondent had inscribed a teardrop
    tattoo on his face a few months after the murder.  However, the information
    relied on by Dr. Totten, which was received from the various gang members
    during his interview process, was clearly not proved within the confines of
    this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Experts,
    in forming their opinions, often rely on information gathered using techniques
    and methods common to their field of expertise, even though that information is
    not proved within the four corners of the case in which the opinion is
    offered.  The reliability of the information received by Dr. Totten in the
    interview process was obviously crucial to the ultimate weight to be assigned
    to his opinion.  It was, however, a matter for the jury and not a reason to
    exclude the opinion:  see <i>St. John (City of) v. Irving Oil Ltd.</i>, [1966]
    S.C.R. 581, at p. 592; <i>R. v. B. (S.A.)</i> (2003), 178 C.C.C. (3d) 193

  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>IV:  THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE GANG MEMBERS’
    EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    outlined above, the Crown proposed to elicit evidence from A.B., C.S. and G.D. 
    All three could testify to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo within their group
    of friends and associates, some of whom were Malvern Crew gang members.  In
    addition, the Crown proposed to elicit evidence from G.D. of the circumstances
    surrounding a conversation he had with the respondent in which the respondent
    admitted he had killed Mr. Peter.  The Crown contended that the circumstances
    surrounding that admission were capable of demonstrating that the respondent
    shared the same understanding of the meaning of a teardrop tattoo as the other
    gang members, and had acted on that understanding by inscribing a teardrop
    tattoo on his face after he murdered Mr. Peter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge excluded this evidence.  I will consider first the admissibility of the
    evidence concerning the meaning of a teardrop tattoo within the Malvern Crew
    gang culture.  I will then consider the admissibility of the evidence given by
    G.D. concerning the events surrounding the respondent’s alleged admission to
    G.D. that he had killed Mr. Peter.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(i)  The Meaning of a Teardrop
    Tattoo in the Malvern Crew Culture</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B.
    testified on a <i>voir dire</i> that he first saw the respondent with a
    teardrop tattoo in May 2004.  He could not recall any discussion with the
    respondent about the tattoo.  He was then asked what a teardrop tattoo meant to
    him.  A.B. responded that it could mean either that the wearer of the tattoo
    had killed someone or that someone close to that person had died.  A.B.
    confirmed that a teardrop tattoo had one of those two meanings within the group
    of people, including the Malvern Crew, that he associated with on a regular
    basis.  A.B. believed that the respondent’s teardrop tattoo was meant to
    indicate that he had killed someone.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the
    trial judge’s request, A.B. was asked how he came to believe that a teardrop
    tattoo had one of the two meanings he had described in his evidence.  He
    indicated that he heard people “on the street” talking about it and had also
    seen reference to it on television and in the movies.  A.B. had not discussed
    the meaning of a teardrop tattoo with other Malvern Crew gang members and he
    was unaware of any gang “policy” relating to tattoos.  When pressed, A.B. could
    not identify a specific person with whom he had discussed the meaning of a
    teardrop tattoo.  When further pressed as to why he believed that a teardrop
    tattoo had one of two possible meanings in his group culture, A.B. answered:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I couldn’t answer.  I’m not sure how I like to say
    on behalf of them how they know, but I just, me, personally, I believe they
    know, because I think it is a fact.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.S.’s <i>voir
    dire</i> evidence as to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo was much the same as
    A.B.’s evidence.  C.S. indicated that he gained his understanding of the
    meaning of a teardrop tattoo from watching rap videos, documentaries and other
    gang-related films.  He also testified that he and his associates would from
    time to time discuss the meaning of teardrop tattoos.  It was from these
    discussions that he came to believe there was a common understanding of the
    possible meanings to be attributed to a teardrop tattoo.  C.S. testified that
    at one time he asked the respondent why he had inscribed a teardrop tattoo on
    his face.  The respondent replied, “just stupidity”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G.B., a
    long time and senior member of the Malvern Crew, testified that “getting a
    teardrop on your face, it means you took a life, that’s what it means to me”. 
    G.B. indicated that the meaning of a teardrop tattoo was not the subject of
    conversation among gang members, but that he understood the meaning because in
    “the culture I’m from that’s what it means”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge treated the evidence of the three gang members as to the meaning of a
    teardrop tattoo in their culture as akin to expert evidence.  He called upon
    the Crown to establish the basis for the witnesses’ belief as to the meaning of
    a teardrop tattoo.  The trial judge then found that the basis put forward in
    the evidence was “hearsay and unreliable”.  In excluding the evidence, he noted
    that the witnesses did not have “direct knowledge of the meaning of a teardrop
    tattoo”, but instead relied on a variety of unreliable sources such as movies
    and television.  The trial judge held that evidence as to the meaning of a
    teardrop tattoo within the gang culture in which the respondent lived was
    admissible only from a gang member who had a teardrop tattoo, or from a gang
    member who had spoken to the respondent about the reason he placed the teardrop
    tattoo on his face.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree
    with Crown counsel that neither requirement imposed by the trial judge was
    necessary to the admissibility of the evidence.  The three gang members who
    testified were deeply immersed in the gang culture to which the respondent also
    belonged.  They offered evidence as to the meaning of a certain symbol within
    that culture based on their day-to-day involvement in it.  The mere fact that
    none had a teardrop tattoo could not disqualify them from speaking to the
    meaning of that symbol within their culture.  As Crown counsel cogently argued,
    individuals within a given community or culture may well know the meaning of
    slang words, hand gestures or the symbolic meaning of certain kinds of clothing
    even though those individuals have never personally used the slang words,
    gestures or worn the clothing.  To take an obvious example, I would think that
    anyone living in Toronto could give evidence based on their knowledge of
    customs within the community that persons wearing certain uniforms were police
    officers.  It would be irrelevant that the person giving this evidence had
    never worn a police uniform and that his knowledge about the uniforms worn by
    police officers came in part from movies and television.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    absence of any direct explanation from the respondent concerning the meaning of
    his teardrop tattoo was also irrelevant to the admissibility of the evidence
    offered by the three gang members.  Had the respondent said anything about the
    meaning of his tattoo, that statement could have been admissible against the
    respondent as an admission.  That would, however, constitute an entirely
    different basis for receiving the evidence.  Whether or not the respondent
    spoke to the three gang members about his tattoo had nothing to do with the
    gang members’ ability to testify as to their understanding of the symbolic
    meaning of that tattoo within the world in which they lived.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B., C.S.
    and G.B. were not put forward as experts on the symbolic meanings of tattoos. 
    Their evidence was based on their knowledge gained from living within and being
    part of a particular group culture.  It is hardly surprising that they could
    not identify with any specificity the source of their knowledge.  Virtually any
    group, be it a gang or a profession, develops a jargon and symbology which is
    understood by those who live within that milieu.  The witness’s ability to
    speak to the common understanding of a symbol comes not from the reliability of
    any particular source of knowledge but from that witness’s day-to-day living
    within the culture.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B., C.S.
    and G.B. should have been allowed to testify as to their understanding of the
    meaning of a teardrop tattoo within the culture in which they and the
    respondent lived.  All could have been cross-examined.  No doubt weaknesses in
    their evidence, including the basis upon which the witnesses formed their
    belief as to the meaning of the teardrop tattoos, would have been fully
    explored on cross-examination.  It would have been for the jury to decide
    whether to accept that evidence.  If, however, the jury accepted the evidence
    of these witnesses as to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo, that evidence could connect
    Dr. Totten’s opinion about the meaning of teardrop tattoos within urban street
    gangs with the specific street gang culture in which the respondent lived and
    operated.  This evidence was, potentially, an important link in the Crown’s
    case.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>(ii)  The Context of G.B.’s
    Conversation with the Respondent </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G.B. had a
    conversation with the respondent in the summer of 2004.  According to G.B., the
    respondent admitted that he and three other members of the Malvern Crew had
    killed Mr. Peter.  The respondent’s description of the murder to G.B. was
    consistent with the description he allegedly gave to A.B. and C.S. shortly
    after the murder.  The admissibility of the respondent’s admission to G.B. was
    not in dispute.  The jury heard G.B.’s testimony about the alleged admission
    made by the respondent.  The Crown also sought to lead evidence of the exchange
    between G.B. and the respondent immediately before the respondent’s alleged
    confession.  The Crown contended that this exchange precipitated the
    confession.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a <i>voir
    dire</i>, G.B. testified that he saw the respondent in the summer of 2004.  He
    noticed the teardrop tattoo on the respondent’s face.  The respondent had not
    had the tattoo when G.B. had seen him on previous occasions.  To G.B., a long
    time member of the Malvern Crew, the teardrop tattoo meant “you took a life”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G.B. did
    not think it was wise for the respondent to have put the tattoo on his face. 
    He said to the respondent:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>What are you doing, like, kinda of, like, you’re
    putting yourself on heat; putting yourself on that – on your face is just
    bringing heat to yourself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent made no reply.  G.B. then immediately asked the respondent, “what
    happened”.  In posing his question, G.B. made no reference to Mr. Peter’s death
    or to any other specific event.  To this point in the conversation, no one had
    mentioned anyone’s murder.  In response to G.B.’s question, the respondent
    immediately launched into a detailed description of his murder of Mr. Peter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge addressed the admissibility of G.B.’s evidence at several different
    times.  On more than one occasion, he said that although he had been initially
    inclined to admit the evidence, he had reconsidered the matter and decided that
    the evidence should be excluded.  The trial judge found that, as the respondent
    did not make any explicit response to G.B.’s comment about his teardrop tattoo,
    the proposed evidence was not sufficiently probative to warrant its admission. 
    He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Clearly, if Mr. Abbey had responded in any fashion
    about the teardrop tattoo, that evidence would have been admissible and
    consistent with my prior arguments – prior reasons.  He said nothing and you
    came back to it several times, and it just wasn’t there – implicit, perhaps,
    but not explicit.  And the problem with implicit versus explicit, given the
    nature of the evidence, there is a weighing of probative value and prejudicial
    effect that I have to do here.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge erred in excluding G.B.’s evidence of the events leading up to the
    respondent’s alleged confession.  The trial judge’s observation that an
    explicit acknowledgement by the respondent concerning the purpose of the tattoo
    would have been admissible, while no doubt accurate, had no bearing on the
    admissibility of the evidence as tendered.  The probative value of evidence is
    determined by the nature of that evidence and the context in which it is
    offered, not by some comparative analysis with the probative value of different
    hypothetical evidence that is not available.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury
    could reasonably infer from G.B.’s evidence that upon seeing the teardrop
    tattoo, he believed that the respondent had killed someone.  After commenting
    on the inadvisability of advertising such conduct, G.B. asked the respondent
    what had happened, meaning what happened to cause the respondent to put the
    tattoo on his face.  A reasonable jury could further infer that the respondent
    understood exactly what G.B. was asking him and proceeded to explain why he put
    the teardrop tattoo on his face.  That explanation came in the form of a
    description of his murder of Mr. Peter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G.B.’s
    evidence about the context in which the respondent’s admission was made could
    potentially bring home to the respondent the evidence concerning the meaning of
    a teardrop tattoo within the culture in which the respondent lived.  G.B.’s
    evidence was capable of supporting the contention that the respondent also
    understood that a teardrop tattoo indicated the murder of a rival gang member
    and that he had acted upon that understanding by placing the teardrop tattoo on
    his face after killing Mr. Peter.    </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>V.        THE
    ADMISSIBILITY OF DETECTIVE SERGEANT QUAN’S OPINION EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown
    sought to have Detective Sergeant Quan, a long time member of the Toronto
    Police Service, offer an opinion as to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo. 
    Detective Sergeant Quan was the lead investigator on the Guns and Gangs Task
    Force.  It was accepted that he had expertise concerning many facets of gang
    activity.  The defence did not, however, concede that he was qualified to offer
    an opinion as to the meaning of a teardrop tattoo.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Sergeant Quan gave extensive evidence on a <i>voir dire</i>.  The trial judge
    did not rule on the admissibility of his opinion evidence at the end of that <i>voir
    dire</i> but proceeded with other evidentiary matters.  In the ensuing weeks,
    the admissibility of Detective Sergeant Quan’s testimony arose in the course of
    argument on many occasions.   During these exchanges, the trial judge expressed
    a variety of concerns about the admissibility of that evidence.  As I read the
    record, the trial judge never made a formal ruling as to the admissibility of
    Detective Sergeant Quan’s evidence.  It seems clear, however, that by the end
    of the various <i>voir dires</i>, the Crown and defence understood that
    Detective Sergeant Quan’s evidence as tendered on the <i>voir dire</i> would
    not be admissible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown
    argues that Detective Sergeant Quan’s opinion evidence should have been
    admitted.  The Crown does not argue, however, that the improper exclusion of
    that evidence, standing alone, would justify a new trial.  As I would require a
    new trial based on the other errors identified above, it is not essential to
    the disposition of this appeal that I pass upon the admissibility of Detective
    Sergeant Quan’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have
    concluded that I should not address the admissibility of Detective Sergeant
    Quan’s opinion.  Quite frankly, the record as it stands relating to Detective
    Sergeant Quan’s evidence is quite confusing.  On one reading, it could be said
    that the Crown eventually abandoned its attempt to introduce his evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the
    Crown proposes to lead the opinion evidence of Detective Sergeant Quan at a new
    trial, it will be for the trial judge to determine its admissibility according
    to the operative principles and approach set out in these reasons.  That trial
    judge will not be bound by anything said by this trial judge concerning
    Detective Sergeant Quan’s evidence.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>VI.      THE APPROPRIATE ORDER</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown
    has established that the trial judge erred in law in excluding Dr. Totten’s
    opinion concerning the possible meanings of the teardrop tattoo within urban
    street gang cultures.  The Crown has further established that the trial judge
    erred in excluding the evidence of the three gang members concerning the
    meaning of a teardrop tattoo in their group of friends and Malvern Crew gang
    members, and in excluding the evidence of G.B. concerning the exchange relating
    to the respondent’s teardrop tattoo immediately preceding his alleged
    confession to G.B.  The respondent’s acquittal, however, can be set aside only
    if the Crown demonstrates that but for the cumulative effect of these errors,
    the verdict would not necessarily have been the same.  Double jeopardy
    principles, while modified in Canada to permit Crown appeals from acquittals,
    demand that acquittals be quashed only where the appellate court can say with a
    reasonable degree of certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by
    the legal errors:  <i>R. v. Graveline</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.),
    at paras. 14-16; <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown
    has met its burden.  The excluded evidence must be looked at as whole.  Viewed
    cumulatively, the excluded evidence could reasonably present a compelling
    picture for the Crown.  The excluded evidence moves from Dr. Totten’s general
    opinion about the meaning of a teardrop tattoo within urban street gang
    culture, to the more specific evidence of the gang members from the Malvern
    Crew concerning the tattoo’s meaning within their cultural milieu, to the
    arguably implicit acknowledgement by the respondent in his conversation with
    G.B. that his teardrop tattoo symbolized his murder of Mr. Peter.  I do not
    suggest that a jury would necessarily take that view of the excluded evidence. 
    I say only that a reasonable jury could take that view.  If it did, the verdict
    could very well be different.  </p>

    the non-publication of any information that could identify certain civilian
    witnesses.  In the course of his rulings on the admissibility of parts of the
    evidence given by two of the gang members, the trial judge referred to one gang
    member as A.B. and the other as C.S. (not their real initials).  I will use
    those same initials to refer to those witnesses in these reasons.  I will refer
    to the third gang member, part of whose evidence was also excluded, as G.D. </p>

    Although it would appear that Dr. Totten was the only witness on the <i>voir
    dire</i> into the admissibility of his opinion, the trial judge did refer
    briefly to evidence heard on the <i>voir dire</i> into the admissibility of
    Detective Sergeant Quan’s evidence in his reasons for excluding Dr. Totten’s
    evidence.  </p>

    consider different parts of the proposed opinion evidence individually. 
    Whatever may be said about the admissibility of Dr. Totten’s opinion concerning
    the meaning of a teardrop tattoo, his evidence as to the timing of the
    inscription of the tattoo (para. 51) does not seem founded either in his
    research or his clinical experience, but rather seems a product of what Dr.
    Totten thought was common sense.  It may be that this aspect of Dr. Totten’s
    evidence would not be admissible even if his main opinion was admitted.</p>

    care in negligence actions is not unlike Dr. Totten’s evidence in that

    A.B. released February 7, 2007.  The reasons relating to C.S. were released

    abound.  For example, how does the golfer know that when a ball flies off in
    one direction it is a “hook” and when it flies off in the other it is a
    “slice”?  Because, those are the words commonly used by other golfers and golf
    commentators on television and print to refer to balls that fly off in either
    of those manners.  The terms convey a common meaning to those who operate
    within the “golfer” culture.</p>
