  <h2>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>After a judge-alone trial, the
    appellant was found guilty of one count of possession for the purpose of
    trafficking.  She was sentenced to one year in jail.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The circumstances surrounding the
    charge involve the discovery by the police of a substantial amount of crack
    cocaine tucked into a cooler display in a Beer Store.  Just prior to the
    discovery of the drugs, the police observed the appellant enter the Beer Store
    and momentarily crouch down behind the display where the drugs were found.  The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s explanation that she was in the Beer Store
    to purchase something, had bent over near the display to retrieve her key that
    she had dropped, and had no connection with the drugs. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant appeals her
    conviction to this Court on the basis that the trial judge erred in his
    analysis of the evidence, and that his faulty reasoning in this regard led him
    to conclude the Crown had proven possession of crack cocaine beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons that follow, I
    would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h2>II.        Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On July 27, 2007 at 9:40 a.m., two
    uniformed police officers were on duty in the parking lot of a plaza at Queen
    Street and Airport Road.  Apparently, this is an area that experiences problems
    associated with the drug trade.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Just after 10:00 a.m., the
    officers saw the appellant drive into the parking lot.  She got out of her car
    and made several brief calls on her cellular telephone.  A man arrived about 45
    minutes later and the two began a conversation.  At that point, the police approached
    the couple and shouted to get their attention.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant and the man then entered
    the Beer Store.  The police followed the couple and observed the appellant near
    a display of cooler bags.   She bent over for a few seconds and then picked up
    a cooler.  At that point, one of the officers apprehended the appellant and
    took her outside for questioning.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>One of the officers then
    re-entered the Beer Store.  Upon examining the display, he found an open cooler
    bag on the bottom shelf.  Inside the bag he found a white envelope containing 14.25
    grams of crack cocaine. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was then arrested on
    the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking.</span></p>
  <h2>III.      The Reasons of the Trial Judge</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge started his brief
    reasons by describing the case as “circumstantial”.  The appellant was not seen
    in possession of the drugs and there was no evidence discovered in her
    possession indicative of drug trafficking.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge proceeded to
    identify the key issue as being whether the Crown was able to prove possession of
    the drugs beyond a reasonable doubt.  He then examined the evidence upon which
    the Crown relied to establish possession.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Crown relied on the officer’s
    testimony that, according to his observations, the appellant had something
    white in her left hand as she approached the entrance to the Beer Store.  Based
    on the fact that the officer’s recollection came from independent memory only
    and was not recorded in his notes, the trial judge declined to make a finding
    with respect to this aspect of the Crown’s case. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge then turned to the
    appellant’s explanation about the circumstances surrounding her activities at
    the Beer Store parking lot.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant testified that she
    arrived at the Beer Store at 9:15 a.m. and did not enter the store at that time
    since it was closed.  She claimed that she waited in the parking lot until
    10:00 a.m. (when the store opened) and then went inside.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge rejected this
    evidence.  He accepted the police officers’ testimony that the appellant
    arrived at 10:05 a.m. and went into the Beer Store at 10:50 a.m., after the man
    appeared on the scene.  This version of events was corroborated by the
    unchallenged surveillance videotape admitted into evidence at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge then reviewed the
    available circumstantial evidence relevant to possession.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant arrived at the
    parking lot shortly after the Beer Store opened and made several calls as she
    paced around outside of her car.  A man arrived and the two struck up a
    conversation.  The police, suspicions aroused, called out to the couple.  The
    couple then went into the Beer Store.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant immediately went
    behind a display of coolers, briefly crouched down, stood up, picked up a
    cooler and tried to head out of the store.  At that point, the police
    intercepted her. One of the officers returned to the location where the
    appellant had crouched down near the display and discovered crack cocaine
    inside of an envelope in an unzipped cooler bag. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, the trial judge turned to
    the appellant’s evidence that she simply dropped her key while examining the
    display to choose a cooler.  He rejected this testimony as being “palpable
    nonsense”, noting that the spot where she bent over to pick up her key was,
    coincidentally, and the very same place where the police found the drugs.  </span></p>
  <h2>IV.      Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The thrust of the appellant’s
    argument before this Court is that the trial judge improperly assessed the
    evidence.  Specifically, the appellant contends that the trial judge failed to
    undertake a proper analysis as dictated in <i>R. v. W.(D.), </i>[1991] 1 S.C.R.
    742.  The appellant further submits that that the trial judge engaged in
    speculative and flawed reasoning, including the inappropriate use of judicial
    notice.  Taken together, the appellant’s arguments posit that the trial judge
    effectively reversed the onus in this case by requiring the appellant to prove
    her innocence rather than making the Crown bear the burden of demonstrating
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   </span></p>
  <h2>V.        Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As previously indicated, the issue
    in this case is whether the appellant was in possession of crack cocaine.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There is no divide between the
    parties that proof of possession requires the Crown to establish the two
    distinct elements of knowledge and control: see <i>R. v. Beaver, </i>[1957]
    S.C.R. 531; <i>R. v. Martin, </i>[1948] O.R. 962 (C.A.).  No argument was
    raised concerning the proof of these two individual elements.  The dispute is focused
    exclusively on whether the trial judge erred in his analysis of the evidence leading
    to his conclusion that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
    the appellant was the person responsible for depositing the bag of cocaine in
    the cooler display.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>With respect to this inquiry, the relevant
    evidence is the testimony of the police officers concerning the appellant’s
    actions and the subsequent discovery of the crack cocaine, the surveillance
    videotape and the appellant’s testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant argues that the
    trial judge’s analysis of this evidence was defective in two respects.  First,
    he failed properly to apply <i>W.(D.)</i>. Second, he engaged in speculation and
    flawed reasoning by making the following inference: given that no one would
    leave such a valuable amount of crack cocaine lying around, and that the
    appellant had such a close proximate and temporal connection with the location where
    the drugs were found, it stands to reason that she must have been the person
    who put the drugs in the cooler display.  The appellant submits that, as a
    result of these errors, the trial judge impermissibly shifted the burden of
    proof from the Crown to the defendant in this case.  </span></p>
  <h2>(i)        <i><u>W.(D.)</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There is no dispute between the
    parties over the fact that there need not be a formulaic approach to the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis.  The essential aspect of the doctrine lies not in explicitly identifying
    the various stages of <i>W.(D.)</i> but rather in respecting its central tenet
    that the burden of proof must never shift from the Crown: see <i> R. v. Dinardo</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, at para. 23; R<i>. v. S. (W.D.),</i> [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521,
    at p. 533. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The approach dictated by <i>W.(D.)</i> required the trial judge to proceed as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>a)         If
    he believed the defendant’s evidence, he had to acquit; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>b)        If
    he did not believe the defendant’s evidence, but it nevertheless raised a
    reasonable doubt in his mind as to the defendant’s guilt, he had to acquit;
    and, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>c)         Even
    if he was not left in doubt by the defendant’s evidence, he had to inquire into
    whether, on the basis of the evidence he did accept, he was convinced beyond a
    reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The key question, then, is whether
    the reasons disclose that the trial judge respected the substance of the <i>W.(D.) </i>analysis when reviewing the available evidence as to possession in this
    case.  In my view, he did.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In terms of the first step
    mandated by <i>W.(D.),</i> the trial judge did consider whether he believed the
    appellant’s evidence.  His reasons indicate that he did not. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Using strong language, the trial
    judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that she bent down behind the cooler
    display to retrieve her key and that the subsequent discovery of crack cocaine
    in the very same place was a coincidence:   </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>And the idea that this is some sort of coincidence
    that she happened to drop her key on virtually exactly the same spot where a
    half an ounce of cocaine is found moments later is palpable nonsense.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the
    trial judge erred in not explaining the basis upon which he rejected her
    evidence.  I disagree.  The reasons indicate that the trial judge directed
    himself to the decisive question of whether or not the appellant was, in fact, the
    person who deposited the crack cocaine in the display.  The factors affecting
    his finding that the appellant was not credible in this key aspect of her
    testimony are clear.  </span></p>

    lied with respect to the timing of that morning’s events.  While this does not
    mean he had to reject other aspects of her evidence, it was open to the trial
    judge to take that untruth into account when assessing her testimony on other
    issues, such as what happened inside the Beer Store. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The reasons demonstrate that the
    trial judge examined all of the evidence from a balanced perspective.  He was prepared
    to reject some portions of witness testimony but was also open to accepting other
    evidence given by those same witnesses.  For example, he did not rely on the
    officer’s evidence about something white being in the appellant’s hand but found
    other aspects of the police testimony credible.  Similarly, he rejected the
    appellant’s evidence about the timing of events but then proceeded to consider
    her testimony about dropping her key.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, based on all of the
    circumstances, including the surveillance tape and the police evidence that he
    did accept, the trial judge concluded that the appellant’s evidence about her
    conduct that morning at the cooler display defied common sense.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The second stage of the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis focuses on the appellant’s raising a reasonable doubt as to her guilt.
     In my view, it is implicit in the reasons that the trial judge concluded the defence
    evidence on the critical issue of whether the appellant placed the crack
    cocaine into the display, did not raise a reasonable doubt.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, the trial judge examined
    the evidence that he did accept and concluded that the Crown had proven
    possession beyond a reasonable doubt:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The circumstances are that the officers see her come
    in when they say they saw her come in.  They see her behave as they say she
    behaved, looking around on the phone as if she was expecting to meet somebody
    there.  Their suspicions are aroused.  I would find their reasonable suspicions
    are aroused that there may be a drug deal in progress, they behaved accordingly
    and keep an eye on her.  A person who in the circumstances might be a customer
    shows up and is talking to her and that causes them to move in.  She then goes
    into The Beer Store even though they’re calling out to her.  And I accept their
    evidence in that regard.  And as we see on the video, she goes behind the
    display and crouches down briefly and then grabs a cooler and tries to head out
    before she’s intercepted by the police.  The next thing we see on the video is
    one of the officers coming in with his flashlight and there is absolutely no
    question, on the evidence of this case, finding half an ounce of cocaine where
    he says he found it.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is a half an ounce of crack cocaine, people
    don`t just leave that lying around for no reason at all.  And the
    correspondence of her ducking down on the video as she does and then the
    officer finding the cocaine on the video as he does defies any innocent
    explanation whatsoever.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In all the circumstances of this case there is
    absolutely no doubt that she was in possession of the cocaine and when the
    police approached that she went in and tried to hide it in the Beer Store.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons outlined above, I
    would not give effect to the appellant’s arguments concerning the trial judge’s
    departure from the approach mandated by <i>W.(D.)</i>.    In my view, the
    various elements of <i>W.(D.)</i> can be discerned, either explicitly or
    implicitly, in the reasons of the trial judge.  Most important, the reasons adhere
    to the core message of the doctrine, which is that the onus of proving guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt lies with the Crown.  </span></p>
  <h2> (ii)      <u>Speculation and flawed reasoning</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant further submits that
    the trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven possession beyond a
    reasonable doubt based solely on speculation and flawed reasoning, and that he
    did so in a manner that effectively reversed the onus.  The appellant begins by
    characterizing the trial judge’s comment that “people don’t just leave [half an
    ounce of crack cocaine] lying around for no reason at all” as improperly taking
    judicial notice of drug-related behaviour.  The appellant then argues that the trial
    judge relied upon this presumed drug-related behaviour in order to find that the
    appellant’s crouching down in the location where the drugs were found constituted
    a coincidence that “def[ied] any innocent explanation whatsoever”.  Finally,
    the appellant contends that this chain of reasoning – tantamount to a reversal
    of onus – formed the basis for the trial judge’s conclusion that the Crown had
    proven possession beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I do not agree with the
    appellant’s characterization of the trial judge’s reasoning.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As has often been recognized, the
    trial judge occupies a special position in the assessment of evidence - one
    that necessarily attracts a high level of deference.  In this case, the trial
    judge observed the witnesses and heard their testimony.  He watched the
    surveillance tape. With the benefit of that evidence, he made a number of
    findings of fact.  The appellant arrived at the Beer Store at 10:05 a.m..  She
    waited there for 45 minutes and made a number of telephone calls until a man
    arrived.  At 10:50 a.m., when uniformed officers approached the couple, they
    entered the store.  The police observed the appellant go directly to the cooler
    display and bend over.  Immediately thereafter the police retrieved a
    substantial amount of drugs from the same spot where the appellant had just crouched
    down behind the display.  The videotape corroborated this evidence.  These
    findings of fact led the trial judge to draw inferences regarding the
    appellant’s activities and her connection with the drugs.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A certain measure of common sense
    also contributed to this inference, as reflected in the trial judge’s remark
    that sizeable quantities of crack cocaine are not simply left lying around.  But
    such a plainly rational observation falls short of an improper use of judicial
    notice.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ultimately, the reasons do not
    support the appellant’s claims of speculative and flawed analysis. The trial
    judge relied upon multiple findings of fact that were supported by the
    evidence, as well as his own common sense, in order to infer that  the
    appellant had, in fact, deposited the drugs inside the cooler.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In a related argument, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge effectively reversed the onus by forcing
    her to prove her innocence rather than requiring the Crown to demonstrate guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I do not view the trial judge’s
    reasoning that way. The Crown's evidence was capable of supporting the
    conclusion that the drugs were put into the cooler display by the appellant.  The
    fact that the drugs were found in the same location where she bent down by the
    display did not, by itself, bear the full weight of the Crown's burden.  The
    trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that he was aware that the probative value of
    this aspect of the Crown’s evidence depended upon other evidence capable of supporting
    the reasonable inference that the appellant was responsible for the drugs found
    inside the unzipped cooler bag.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Admittedly, the trial judge’s
    comment that the appellant’s conduct “def[ied] any innocent explanation
    whatsoever” was inappropriate.  Taken in isolation, this phrase may be read as
    reversing the onus by suggesting that the lack of an innocent explanation implies
    guilt.   The correct approach, however, is that the trial judge’s reasons “must
    be read and interpreted as a whole” and “cannot be viewed in isolation or in a
    piecemeal fashion”:  <i>R. v. Sparrow</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 3456 (C.A.), at
    para. 55.  Upon reviewing the entirety of the reasons, it is clear that the trial
    judge’s final conclusions were not predicated on a reversal of onus.  This is
    evident not only from his explicit recognition that “it’s not incumbent on the
    accused to prove anything”, but also from the balanced manner in which he
    approached his analysis of all of the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Moreover, I see no error in any
    other aspect of the trial judge’s reasoning.  This was a strong circumstantial
    case.  The trial judge’s findings of fact were supported by the evidence and
    were sufficient to allow him to come to the conclusion that he did – that the
    appellant was the person responsible for depositing the drugs the police
    retrieved from the cooler display and that the required elements for possession
    were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  </span></p>
