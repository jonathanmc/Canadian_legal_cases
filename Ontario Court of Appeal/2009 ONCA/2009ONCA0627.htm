style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole question on this appeal by General Motors is whether the
    plaintiff’s action is for “damages occasioned by a motor vehicle” and,
    therefore, barred by the two-year limitation period under s. 206(1) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. H-8 (“<i>HTA</i>”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, Audrey Longley, parked her GMC pick-up truck in a motel
    parking lot.  She stood on the rear bumper to reach for her jacket, which was
    inside the truck.  As she did so, the rear tailgate of the truck collapsed. 
    Ms. Longley fell to the ground and fractured her wrist.  She claims that the
    tailgate collapsed because it had a defective latch mechanism.  She brought an
    action against General Motors under the Simplified Procedure<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> for damages for defective design and manufacture of the latch mechanism.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accident occurred in May 2001.  However, Ms. Longley did not issue
    her Statement of Claim until February 2006, nearly five years after the
    accident.  General Motors brought a motion for summary judgment, seeking to
    dismiss the action on the grounds it was commenced beyond the prescribed
    two-year period in s. 206(1) of the <i>HTA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge, Henderson J., dismissed the motion.  He first
    addressed the question of the discoverability of the claim.  He found that Ms.
    Longley, by exercising reasonable diligence, ought to have known the material
    facts on which her claim was based no later than April 2002.  Accordingly, this
    date is when the limitation period started to run.  This finding has not been
    appealed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then turned to the question whether s. 206(1) of the <i>HTA</i> barred Ms. Longley’s claim.  Applying the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Heredi v. Fensom</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 741, he concluded that it did not
    because Ms. Longley’s damages were not “occasioned by a motor vehicle”. 
    Therefore, the former six-year limitation for tort actions under s. 45(1)(g) of
    the <i>Limitations Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c.L.15 governed her claim.  Since her
    action was started within this six-year period, it could proceed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>General Motors raises two grounds of appeal from the motion judge’s
    decision.  First, it contends that the motion judge erred in law by misapplying <i>Heredi</i>.  Second, it contends that the motion judge’s decision is at odds
    with this court’s later decision in <i>Karakas v. General Motors of Canada Ltd.</i>,
    [2005] O.J. No. 2462, aff’g (2004), O.R. (3d) 273 (S.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, Ms. Longley says that the motion judge properly applied <i>Heredi</i>,
    and correctly distinguished <i>Karakas</i>.  Alternatively, she says that this
    court ought to overrule its decision in <i>Karakas</i>.  </p>

    (3), no proceeding shall be brought against a person for the recovery of
    damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of two years from

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Over the years, courts across Canada produced
    conflicting decisions on the meaning of the words “occasioned by a motor
    vehicle” in Ontario’s <i>HTA</i> and virtually identical legislation in other
    provinces.  In 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada sought to resolve the conflict
    and set out in <i>Heredi</i> what it called “the proper approach to ‘damages
    occasioned by a motor vehicle’”.  Iacobucci J. wrote the unanimous judgment of
    the court.  Drawing largely on the interpretation of this phrase by Osborne J.
    in <i>Clost v. Colautti Construction Ltd.</i> (1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 339 (H.C.),
    Iacobucci J. discussed the principles that should guide how courts apply the
    phrase “damages occasioned by a motor vehicle”.  At the risk of oversimplifying
    his judgment, I take from <i>Heredi</i> four key principles:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The court must focus on the substance of the
    plaintiff’s claim against the defendant.  Neither how the claim is pleaded nor
    even how the plaintiff was injured is determinative.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The limitation period will apply only if the
    presence of a motor vehicle is the “dominant feature” of the claim.  Conversely,
    the mere presence of a motor vehicle in the chain of causation leading to the
    damages claimed will not trigger the application of the limitation period.  Put
    differently, the damages will be occasioned by a motor vehicle only if the
    “motor vehicle is acting in the character of a motor vehicle”, but not if its
    “nature as a motor vehicle is quite irrelevant to the essence of the action”.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The purpose of the <i>HTA</i> is highly relevant
    to determining the scope of the phrase “damages occasioned by a motor
    vehicle”.  The Act’s purpose is to regulate highway traffic.  Therefore, cases
    where a motor vehicle not traveling on a highway is the dominant feature of a
    claim will be “somewhat rare”.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge is in the best position to
    characterize the claim.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Application of <i>Heredi</i> to this case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge applied <i>Heredi</i> and
    concluded that the truck was not the dominant feature of Ms. Longley’s claim. 
    General Motors submits that he erred in law in so concluding.  I do not accept
    that submission.  The motion judge was best suited to characterize the nature
    of the claim, and I see no reason to depart from his characterization.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the accident occurred, Ms. Longley was not
    driving her truck on the highway.  The truck was parked in a parking lot.  Thus,
    for General Motors to succeed on this appeal, it must establish that this is
    one of those “somewhat rare” cases where a motor vehicle not being driven on a
    highway is nonetheless the “dominant feature” of the claim.  I do not think
    that General Motors can do so.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Longley’s pick-up truck was not “acting in
    the character of a motor vehicle” when the accident happened.  Ms. Longley
    broke her wrist because she fell off the truck’s bumper, which she used as a
    step ladder to retrieve her jacket.  Because she fell from the truck, the truck
    was certainly part of the chain of causation leading to her damages claim.  However,
    it was not the dominant feature of that claim.  At best, it was incidental to
    the claim.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The characterization of what occurred here is
    fairly similar to the characterization of the claim in <i>F.W. Argue Ltd. v.
    Howe</i>, [1969] S.C.R. 354.  There, the defendant drove its fuel truck to the
    plaintiff’s pharmacy to fill the plaintiff’s oil tank.  However, the defendant
    negligently operated its truck fuel pump, causing the plaintiff’s tank to
    overfill.  A fire resulted destroying the pharmacy and surrounding buildings. 
    Although the fuel pump was an integral part of the defendant’s fuel truck, the
    Supreme Court of Canada held that the damages were not occasioned by a motor
    vehicle.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Heredi</i>, Iacobbucci J. approved of the
    result in <i>Argue</i> because the motor vehicle played an ancillary role in
    the claim.  In the case before us, although it might be said that the tailgate
    was an integral part of Ms. Longley’s truck, the truck itself was ancillary to
    the essence of the claim.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Karakas</i>, the plaintiffs sued for
    property damage resulting from a fire which had been caused by defective wiring
    in their car.  The car was parked in the plaintiffs’ garage when the fire
    occurred.  However, as the plaintiffs began their action beyond the two-year
    limitation period in s. 206(1) of the HTA, the defendant moved for summary
    judgment to dismiss the action.  Rouleau J. granted the motion, holding that
    the damages sought were “damages occasioned by a motor vehicle”.  In a one-line
    endorsement, this court dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal.  </span></p>

    Estate Ltd. v. The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</i> (2005), 76 O.R.
    (3d) 161 (C.A.).  This is a three-judge panel; thus, I do not consider it
    appropriate to entertain overruling <i>Karakas</i>.  Nor do I consider it
    necessary to do so.  <i>Karakas</i> is distinguishable from the present case on
    the basis urged by Ms. Longley and accepted by the motion judge.</p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Critical to Rouleau J.’s decision was his
    finding at para. 20 of his reasons that the defective wiring was “a part of the
    motor vehicle integral to the conveyance function of the motor vehicle”.  The
    motion judge distinguished <i>Karakas</i> by noting that a tailgate with a
    defective latch mechanism is not integral to the conveyance function of the
    truck.  I agree with that distinction.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>General Motors seeks to show that this case does
    not differ from <i>Karakas</i> by pointing to the affidavit evidence of one of
    its “senior product investigators”.  In his affidavit, the investigator stated
    that the tailgate “is central to the conveyance of any vehicle equipped with
    one”.  In distinguishing <i>Karakas</i>, the motion judge obviously rejected
    that evidence.  He had good reason to do so.  The wiring at issue in <i>Karakas</i> was integral to the conveyance function because the motor vehicle could not be
    driven without proper wiring.  The tailgate at issue in this appeal was not
    integral to the conveyance function of Ms. Longley’s truck because the truck
    could have been, and indeed was, driven with the defective latch mechanism.</span></p>

    of this court in the later case of <i>Guarantee Company of North America v.

    claim may still be “occasioned by a motor vehicle” if those damages were caused
    by a component of the motor vehicle integral to its conveyance function.
