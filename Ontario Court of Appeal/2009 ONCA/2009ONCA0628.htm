  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Stephen Taub, was formerly a registered representative,
    designated as an “Approved Person” under the by-laws of the Investment Dealers
    Association of Canada (the “IDA”) from June 1988 until he resigned from his
    position with a brokerage firm and from the IDA in September, 2004. In October
    2005, the IDA instituted disciplinary proceedings against him alleging four
    counts of conduct unbecoming in relation to his trading activity for clients
    and in his dealing with his own member firm before his resignation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the respondent originally applied for registration with the IDA, he
    signed an application wherein he agreed to be bound by and to observe and
    comply with the by-laws, rulings, rules and regulations of the IDA and to
    submit to its jurisdiction.  Section&nbsp;20.7 of IDA By-law 20, dealing with
    discipline, provides that Members and Approved Persons remain subject to the
    jurisdiction of the IDA for five years after they cease to be a Member or an
    Approved Person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the respondent moved before the discipline tribunal for an
    order declaring that the IDA had no jurisdiction over him because his status as
    a registered representative had expired in September, 2004, before the
    proceedings against him were instituted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IDA hearing panel concluded that it retained jurisdiction over the respondent.
    On appeal to the Ontario Securities Commission (the “OSC”), the decision of the
    IDA panel was upheld. On further appeal to the Divisional Court, the decision
    was overturned by a majority. The majority held that the OSC’s interpretation
    of the governing legislation was unreasonable, and concluded that the IDA did
    not retain jurisdiction over the respondent after he had resigned. The IDA and
    the OSC appeal the decision of the Divisional Court with leave.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      For the reasons that
    follow, I would allow the appeals.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IDA is a voluntary, self-regulating organization (SRO) recognized by
    the OSC pursuant to s. 21.1 of the <i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5
    (the “Act”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant portions of s. 21.1 read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Self-regulatory organizations</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>21.1&nbsp;(1)</span>&nbsp;The
    Commission may, on the application of a self-regulatory organization, recognize
    the self-regulatory organization if the Commission is satisfied that to do so
    would be in the public interest.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Standards and conduct</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>(3)</span>&nbsp;A recognized
    self-regulatory organization shall regulate the operations and the standards of
    practice and business conduct of its members and their representatives in
    accordance with its by-laws, rules, regulations, policies, procedures,
    interpretations and practices.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 21.6 of the Act grants recognized SROs the authority to impose
    additional requirements within their jurisdiction, provided that these
    additional requirements do not contravene the Act.  Section 21.6 reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>Contravention of Ontario securities law</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>21.6 No by-law, rule, regulation, policy,
    procedure, interpretation or practice of a recognized stock exchange,
    recognized self-regulatory organization, recognized quotation and trade
    reporting system or recognized clearing agency shall contravene Ontario securities law, but a recognized stock exchange, recognized self-regulatory
    organization, recognized quotation and trade reporting system or recognized
    clearing agency may impose additional requirements within its jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IDA admits to registration a number of bodies and persons in various
    capacities, all of which are included either as Members or Approved Persons. All
    Members and Approved Persons admitted to registration with the IDA sign a
    contract agreeing to be bound by its rules and by-laws.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The by-laws relevant to this appeal are IDA By-laws 19 and 20.  By-law
    19 provides for investigations of the conduct of all registrants relating to
    compliance with the by-laws and applicable securities regulations.  By-law 20
    provides for disciplinary hearings, penalties and enforcement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of central concern in this appeal is By-law 20.7(1), which provides the
    IDA with continuing jurisdiction over former Members and Approved Persons for a
    period of five years from the date on which they cease to be a Member or
    Approved Person.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>20.7 Former
    Members and Approved Persons</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) For the purposes of By-law 19 and By-law 20,
    any Member and any Approved Person shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of
    the Association for a period of five years from the date on which such Member
    or Approved Person ceased to be a Member or an Approved Person of the
    Association …</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Instant Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent became an Approved Person as a registered representative
    of the IDA in June 1988.  From 1988 to 2004, he was employed in the securities
    industry.  In September 2004, he ceased being a registered representative of
    the IDA.  Since then, he has not resumed registration with the IDA and has
    indicated in his sworn material that he has no intention of returning to an occupation
    regulated by the IDA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 21, 2005, IDA staff commenced disciplinary proceedings
    against the respondent, alleging that from November 1998 to June 2003, he contravened
    IDA By-law&nbsp;29.1 by engaging in conduct unbecoming. IDA staff alleged,
    among other things, that the respondent facilitated “trading activity that
    appeared to be or was consistent with market manipulation or deception” and
    circumvented rules of the IDA and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) by “opening accounts and accepting orders from clients outside his
    jurisdiction of registration”.  The respondent was also alleged to have
    improperly disclosed and used confidential client information and to have
    misled his Member firm regarding involvement in accounts of certain
    individuals. The disciplinary proceedings against the respondent began more
    than a year after he ceased to be a registered representative of the IDA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 12, 2006, the respondent brought a motion to the hearing panel
    of the District Council seeking a declaration that the IDA lacked jurisdiction
    to proceed against him because he was no longer a registered representative. 
    He claimed that:  (i) the IDA’s continued assertion of jurisdiction over former
    members and approved persons in By-law 20.7 conflicts with s. 21.1 of the Act
    and is therefore of no force or effect in Ontario; and (ii) the IDA cannot rely
    on a private contract with its registrants to extend its jurisdiction in
    Ontario beyond that granted to recognized SROs by the legislature.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      THE DECISIONS BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 1, 2006, the District Council rejected the respondent’s
    motion, concluding that the IDA had jurisdiction to proceed.  It found that
    although the IDA is recognized by the OSC as an SRO under the Act, such
    recognition does not confer jurisdiction on the IDA.  Rather, its jurisdiction
    is based on the contract between it and its Members<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>. 
    The District Council found that the respondent accepted the rules of the IDA
    when he applied and was accepted as a member, and that such acceptance by him
    was a valid and binding contractual obligation.  Further, the District Council
    concluded that By-law 20.7 provided the IDA with jurisdiction over former
    members for a five-year period from cessation of membership and was not <i>ultra
    vires</i> any statute.  The District Council reasoned that to allow a person to
    escape disciplinary sanctions by voluntarily ceasing to be a member was
    contrary to public policy, the preservation of confidence in the IDA, and the
    integrity of the securities industry and markets.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Ontario Securities Commission</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 21.7 of the <i>Securities Act</i> provides a right of
    application to the OSC for a hearing and review of the decision of a district
    council. On May 17, 2007, the OSC dismissed the respondent’s application,
    finding that the District Council made no error in law which would warrant its
    interference and concluding that the IDA was entitled to discipline former
    members under the terms of its by-laws.  In particular, the OSC found:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>section 21.1(3) of the Act requires the IDA to “regulate the
    operations and standards of practice and business conduct of its members and
    their representatives in accordance with  its  by-laws,   rules,  regulations,  policies, procedures, interpretations
    and practices”.  It does not in any way attempt to define or restrict the
    provisions of such by-laws, rules, regulations or other regulatory
    requirements; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>to interpret s. 21.1(3) as limiting the disciplinary jurisdiction
    of the IDA to current members would undermine the IDA’s ability to discipline
    its members and would be inconsistent with its obligations to protect the public
    interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent appealed the OSC decision to the Divisional Court.  The
    majority allowed the appeal.  Applying the factors enunciated by the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, the
    majority concluded that the appropriate standard of review to be applied to the
    OSC’s decision was the reasonableness standard.  However, applying that
    standard, it held that the OSC’s finding that the IDA could discipline former
    members was an unreasonable one.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority reasoned that although the IDA is a voluntary organization,
    its character changed when it was recognized under s. 21.1 of the Act, as did
    its contractual relationship with its members.  The majority found that s.
    21.1(3) limited the disciplinary jurisdiction of an SRO to current members, and
    that the provision could not be stretched to include the discipline of former
    members without doing violence to the meaning of the Act.  In dissenting
    reasons, Carnwath J. agreed with the majority’s conclusion that the standard of
    review was reasonableness, but concluded that the OSC’s finding that s.&nbsp;21.1(3)
    did not limit the IDA’s jurisdiction was both reasonable and correct.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=ParaNO> (1)       Is
    reasonableness the correct standard of review of the decision of the OSC?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)       If
    so, is the OSC decision that s. 21.1(3) of the <i>Securities Act</i> does not
    limit the disciplinary jurisdiction of the IDA to current members a reasonable
    one?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(3)      
    Did the Divisional Court err by ordering the OSC to issue a declaration?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p><b>(1)       Standard of review</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the respondent seeks to uphold the result reached by the
    majority of the Divisional Court, he submits that the court erred in its
    determination of the standard of review. He submits that the issue the OSC was
    determining was an issue of jurisdiction that must be reviewed on the
    correctness standard. He acknowledges that the issue was not, however, the
    OSC’s own jurisdiction, but rather the OSC’s determination of the jurisdiction
    of the IDA over its former members that was in issue. That acknowledgment is
    fatal to his argument. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the court made it clear that issues of “true
    jurisdiction” “arise where the tribunal must explicitly determine whether its
    statutory grant of power gives it the authority to decide a particular matter.”
    (para. 59) Here on the appeal to the OSC, the OSC had the authority to
    interpret and apply s. 21.1(3) of the <i>Securities Act</i> to determine
    whether that section limited the jurisdiction of the IDA, once it had become a
    recognized SRO, to discipline only current members. The issue on standard of
    review was whether the OSC’s interpretation had to be the correct one, or only
    a reasonable one.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Divisional Court that following the decision of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Dunsmuir,</i> <i>supra, </i>the standard of
    review of the decision of the OSC is one of reasonableness. In this case, the
    issue that was determined by the OSC was the interpretation of its home
    statute, the <i>Securities Act</i>, a subject that falls squarely within its
    expertise. The majority of the Divisional Court described it this way at para.
    28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question before the Securities Commission was a
    question it was entitled to decide in fulfilling the mandate given to it by the
    Legislature. The answer to the question invokes the Commission’s expertise as a
    regulator. We therefore conclude that the standard of review on this appeal is
    one of reasonableness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir,</i> after stating that it was simplifying the standard
    of review analysis process by reducing the standards to two only, correctness
    and reasonableness, the Supreme Court then discussed the two standards and the
    process for determining which standard to apply in any particular case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court explained that reasonableness is a deferential standard. The
    reviewing court defers to the decision-making process of the tribunal and to
    the reasonableness of the outcome. I observe that this is not deference to a
    discretionary decision which is accorded because the decision-maker is in the
    best position to make the decision and for reasons of judicial economy. Rather,
    deference is accorded out of respect for the expertise and experience of the
    decision-making tribunal where the process it used is justified, transparent
    and intelligible, and where the decision “falls within a range of possible,
    acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.”
    (para. 47).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has been said that where the standard of review is not correctness,
    on issues within its expertise an administrative tribunal has “the right to be
    wrong”: e.g. <i>Air Canada v. International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace
    Workers</i>, [1978] O.J. No. 1053 (Div. Ct.), at para. 11. In my view, <i>Dunsmuir</i> has made it clear that if this was ever true, it no longer is. Where there is a
    question that is reviewable on the reasonableness standard, a decision that is found
    to be unreasonable will in virtually every case for that reason be wrong. If a
    decision deserves deference because of the process by which it was reached and
    because the result is a reasonable one, then it will not be wrong. As I stated
    above, the administrative law concept of deference is not accorded on the basis
    of deference to an exercise of quasi-judicial discretion, but on the basis of
    respect for an experienced decision-maker with particular expertise who has
    engaged in a process and reached an outcome that has been demonstrated to
    warrant that deference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, there is no deference when applying the correctness
    standard. In that case, the court conducts its own analysis of the issue and
    determines the correct answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the court also explained the process for determining
    which of the two standards to apply. There are three factors for consideration that
    lead to the application of the reasonableness standard (para. 55):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(a)       a
    privative clause;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(b)      a
    discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision-maker has
    special expertise e.g. labour relations;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(c)       the
    nature of the question of law – one that is of “central importance to the legal
    system…and outside the …specialized area of expertise” of the administrative
    decision-maker “will always attract a correctness standard.” (reference to <i>Toronto
    (City) v. C.U.P.E., </i>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 at para. 62) In contrast, other
    questions of law may still be “compatible with a reasonableness standard where
    the two above factors so indicate.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court recognized the difficulty that courts may have in
    applying the reasonableness standard of review to a question of law, since
    traditionally courts are used to deciding questions of law and statutory
    interpretation on the basis that the interpretation must be correct. Referring
    to the three factors listed above, the court stated (at para. 56):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If these factors, considered together, point to a
    standard of reasonableness, the decision maker’s decision must be approached
    with deference in the sense of respect discussed earlier in these reasons.
    There is nothing unprincipled in the fact that some questions of law will be
    decided on the basis of reasonableness. It simply means giving the adjudicator’s
    decision appropriate deference in deciding whether a decision should be upheld,
    bearing in mind the factors indicated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the court discussed the three narrow categories of cases where
    the correctness standard of review will apply. The first is a true question of
    the jurisdiction of the tribunal, i.e., “where the tribunal must explicitly
    determine whether its statutory grant of power gives it the authority to decide
    a particular matter” (para. 59).  The second is where there is a question of general
    law “that is both of central importance to the legal system as a whole and
    outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise” (para. 60). The third is
    where there is a determination of jurisdiction between two competing tribunals
    (para. 61).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir</i>, because the question before the tribunal was a
    question of law within its expertise, the reasonableness standard of review
    applied. However, as did the majority in this case, the Supreme Court held that
    the tribunal’s decision was unreasonable. It did so by finding that the
    adjudicator’s reasoning process was “deeply flawed.” The court held that the
    adjudicator’s decision regarding discharge, which treated a non-unionized
    employee as a unionized employee, effectively ignored the private law context
    in which the dispute arose.  Furthermore, the adjudicator “adopted a reasoning
    process that was fundamentally inconsistent with the employment contract, and
    thus, fatally flawed” (para.&nbsp;74). As a result, the decision was not one
    that fell within “the range of acceptable outcomes that are defensible in
    respect of the facts and the law” (para. 74), and was therefore “simply
    unreasonable in the context of the legislative wording and the larger labour
    context in which it is embedded” (para. 76).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the majority of the Divisional Court, having concluded
    that the issue of statutory interpretation before the tribunal was a question
    of law within the unique expertise of the OSC and was therefore reviewable on
    the standard of reasonableness, concluded that the OSC’s interpretation was
    unreasonable. However, it did so neither by assessing the process of reasoning
    used by the OSC to reach its decision, nor by considering whether its
    interpretation was within a range of reasonable interpretations of the statutory
    provision in issue. Instead, the majority conducted its own analysis of the provision
    and came to its own conclusion about its correct interpretation. Some examples
    of the language used by the majority demonstrate its approach. For example, at
    para. 35 the majority states: “<i>The court must decide</i> whether the wording
    of s.&nbsp;21.1(3) of the <i>Securities Act</i> is limiting, in the sense that
    it prescribes whom a self-regulated organization may regulate (emphasis added).”
    And at para. 47 it states: “In view of <i>our conclusion</i> that the <i>Securities
    Act</i> does not authorize self-regulatory bodies recognized under the Act to
    discipline former members….” (Emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, the majority employed the approach that the Supreme
    Court described in <i>Dunsmuir</i> is only to be used when reviewing an
    administrative decision on the standard of correctness, where no deference is
    accorded and where the court conducts its own analysis of the issue in order to
    come to the correct decision.  In taking this approach, the majority erred in
    law.</p>
  <h3>(2)       Is the OSC decision
    that s. 21.1(3) of the <i>Securities Act</i> does not limit the disciplinary
    jurisdiction of the IDA to current members a reasonable one?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed above, in order to determine whether the decision of the
    OSC in this case was reasonable, the first step is to consider the process the
    tribunal followed to reach its decision.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><i>The OSC’s reasoning process</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC began its reasons with an overview, followed by a history of the
    respondent’s employment, the disciplinary proceedings, the decisions under
    review and the issues to be determined on the review. The first issue was the
    standard of review. The OSC discussed its authority under s. 21.7 of the Act to
    conduct a “hearing and review” of a decision of a self-regulatory organization,
    and under s. 8(3) to make any decision it considers proper, <i>i.e</i>. to
    substitute its judgment for that of the SRO. However, the OSC noted that its
    practice when reviewing decisions of an SRO is to accord deference to factual
    determinations that are “central to the SRO’s specialized competence”, and only
    to interfere on one of the following grounds:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the SRO proceeded on an incorrect principle;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the SRO erred in law;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the SRO overlooked some material evidence;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       new and compelling evidence is presented;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)      the
    SRO’s perception of the public interest conflicts with the OSC’s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, the OSC stated that it would not substitute its own view
    just because it would have reached a different conclusion in the circumstances.
    In this case, the appeal was based on an alleged error of law in the District
    Council’s interpretation of s. 21.1. The Commission concluded that it would
    interfere only if it determined that the District Council of the IDA had made
    an error of law.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Reasonableness of the outcome</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second step in reviewing a decision on the reasonableness standard
    is to consider the reasons of the tribunal to see whether they are “justified,
    transparent and intelligible”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After deciding its standard of review, the OSC then turned to the merits
    of the legal question in dispute, first setting out the positions of the
    parties followed by legal analysis.  The respondent acknowledged that the IDA
    is not a statutory body but rather a voluntary association that derives its
    authority from its contract with its members and their agreement to abide by
    its by-laws, rules, regulations and other requirements.  However, when the OSC
    recognized the IDA as an SRO, that recognition limited and restricted the IDA’s
    pre-existing contractual jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, the respondent argues that s. 21.1(3) of the Act limits
    the jurisdiction of a recognized SRO to its members, meaning current members,
    not former members. Therefore, because s. 21.6 allows a recognized SRO to enact
    by-laws or other requirements, but only “within its jurisdiction”, by-law 20.07,
    which allows the IDA to discipline former members, is <i>ultra vires</i> and
    therefore unenforceable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the positions of the parties, the OSC then began its
    analysis with a discussion of the voluntary, non-statutory authority of the
    IDA. The OSC quoted from a decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, <i>Ripley
    v. Investment Dealers Assn. (Business Conduct Committee)</i> (1991), 108 N.S.R.
    (2d) (C.A.) at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Investment Dealers Association (IDA), as
    explained at some length in the appellant’s factum, is an unincorporated
    association which oversees the investment and brokerage business in Canada,
    serving as the professional organization of, and regulating, member brokerage
    houses and their employees. It is not specifically empowered under any statute,
    although its existence is recognized in some securities legislation. It has its
    own constitution, by-laws and regulations to which its members bind themselves
    by contract to comply. The IDA establishes requirements for capitalization, procedures
    for purchase, sale and registration of securities for clients, audit procedures
    and other matters that govern the internal and external operations of national
    and local investment firms. The IDA also sets standards of qualifications for,
    and for the discipline of, persons engaged in the industry. Its authority does
    not extend to regulating the actual issuance of securities: that is vested in
    provincial securities commissions and the various stock exchanges sold. The
    sale of securities is regulated by statute in all Provinces. It is the persons
    and the firms who sell the securities that are regulated by the IDA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC then referred to s. 21.1(1). of the Act which empowers the OSC to
    recognize an SRO if it is satisfied that to do so would be in the public
    interest, and to s.&nbsp;21.1(3) which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A recognized self-regulatory organization shall regulate the operations
    and the standards of practice and business conduct of its members and their
    representatives in accordance with its by-laws, rules, regulations, policies,
    procedures, interpretations and practices.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC noted that the IDA was recognized pursuant to those provisions
    on December&nbsp;14, 1994 and was renewed up to and after October 31, 1995. The
    OSC referred to the decision of this court in <i>Morgis v. Thomson Kernaghan
    &amp; Co.</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) at para. 12, where the court held
    that the terms and conditions of recognition “require the IDA to enforce
    compliance by its members with the rules of the IDA, as a matter of contract
    and without prejudice to any discipline by the Commission under Ontario
    securities law.”  The court also pointed out that recognition of the IDA is
    part of a statutory securities scheme designed to protect investors and to
    foster fair and efficient capital markets (para. 32).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC referred to the constitution of the IDA and to its public
    interest mandate including adopting and enforcing high standards of business
    conduct among its members. In particular, ss. 2(b) and (c) of the constitution
    provide as among the IDA’s objectives:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)      To
    encourage through self-discipline and self-regulation a high standard of
    business conduct among Members and their partners, directors, officers and
    employers and to adopt, and enforce compliance with, such practices and
    requirements as may be necessary and desirable to guard against conduct
    contrary to the interests of Members, their clients or the public;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       To
    establish, and enforce compliance with, standards and requirements relating to
    capital market participants for the protection of Members, their clients and
    the public;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC found that in enacting by-law 20.7 extending its disciplinary jurisdiction
    to former members for 5 years after they ceased to be members for misconduct committed
    while they were members, the IDA was fully within the authority granted to a recognized
    SRO under s. 21.6 of the Act, <i>i.e</i>., to “impose additional requirements
    within its jurisdiction.” Accordingly, the OSC found that the by-law was
    neither in contravention of s. 21.1(3), nor beyond the jurisdiction of the IDA.
    Specifically, the OSC found that s. 21.1(3) neither defines nor restricts the
    by-laws that a recognized SRO may enact in order to fulfill its mandate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC distinguished this court’s decision in <i>Chalmers v. Toronto
    Stock Exchange </i>(1989), 70 O.R. (2d) 532 (C.A.), which held that it was
    beyond the jurisdiction of the Toronto Stock Exchange to enact a by-law that
    allowed it to discipline former members. The court held that the Toronto Stock
    Exchange was a creature of statute that depended on the <i>Toronto Stock
    Exchange Act</i>, 1982, S.O. 1982, c. 27, for its existence and powers. In
    contrast, the OSC noted that the IDA is a voluntary association not created by
    statute and not dependent on a statute for its powers or existence. Instead, it
    regulates its members by contractual agreement whereby they agree to be bound
    by its by-laws and other rules and regulations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the OSC concluded that as a matter of policy, because the by-laws
    and other rules of the IDA constitute “part of the fabric of securities
    regulation” in Ontario, “it would be contrary to the public interest to allow
    the applicant to avoid such regulation by simply resigning his membership in
    the IDA.” The OSC agreed with the submission of IDA staff that the respondent’s
    interpretation would undermine the IDA’s ability to discipline its members and
    in that way would be inconsistent with its duty to protect the public interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC therefore concluded that the District Council made no error of
    law, <i>i.e</i>., its interpretation of the Act was correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the OSC’s reasons for decision are clear, they are
    understandable, and they justify the result reached. The reasons focus on the
    issues raised and address the reasons why the OSC agreed with the decision of
    the District Council, namely, that s.&nbsp;21.1(3) of the Act authorizing a
    recognized SRO to regulate the conduct of its “members” does not limit a
    recognized SRO’s jurisdiction to current members only.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Is the decision of the OSC within a range of acceptable
    outcomes?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final step for a court in reviewing a decision of a tribunal on the
    reasonableness standard is to decide whether the result reached falls within a
    range of acceptable, defensible outcomes.  I now turn to that analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essential argument of the respondent is that s. 21.1(3) of the Act,
    which refers to the obligation of the IDA to regulate the business conduct of
    its members, effectively limits the jurisdiction of the IDA to discipline
    members for such misconduct only while they continue to be members, but not
    after they have resigned. In my view, this argument does not withstand
    scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as both the District Council and the OSC have said, the language
    of s.&nbsp;21.1(3) is not jurisdictionally-limiting.  The provision sets out the
    statutory obligations of a recognized SRO, but does not state that those are its
    only obligations or powers. In <i>Dass v. Investment Dealers Assn. of Canada </i>(2008),
    85 B.C.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 53 (C.A.),  the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    was faced with the same issue pursuant to the <i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.B.C.
    1996, c. 418, regarding the jurisdiction of the IDA to discipline former
    members.  The court pointed to the error in the reasoning of the majority of
    the Divisional Court in the instant case that recognition of an SRO under the
    Act somehow transforms the character of the association and affects its
    contractual relationship with its members. The British Columbia Court of Appeal
    attributed this error to a misunderstanding of this court’s decision in <i>Morgis,
    supra</i>. In particular, in <i>Dass</i>, the court referred to paras. 31-32 of <i>Morgis</i>, where this court affirmed that the IDA’s duties are not
    determined by statute and that recognition by the OSC does not transform the
    IDA into a government actor. The British Columbia Court of Appeal concluded
    that the decision of the British Columbia Securities Commission that the IDA
    could discipline former members was a reasonable one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, s. 21.6 of the Act specifically provides that a recognized SRO
    may “impose additional requirements within its jurisdiction.”  Because s.
    21.1(3) does not limit the jurisdiction of the SRO to regulate only current
    members, s. 21.6 effectively enlarges the power of the SRO to enact rules to
    fulfill its regulatory mandate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also raise a third consideration, but only as an alternative. Even if s.
    21.1(3) did limit the IDA’s jurisdiction to regulate and discipline only current
    members, it is not clear that such a limitation refers to the timing of
    discipline, as opposed to the timing of the misconduct. In other words, as long
    as the discipline relates to misconduct that occurred while the person was a
    member, that may be sufficient to comply with any limits that could be said to
    be imposed by the provision. The timing of instituting disciplinary proceedings
    is a procedural rather than a substantive matter that is not addressed in the
    language of the section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in making its decision on the proper interpretation of s.
    21.1(3), the OSC applied its expertise in the securities industry and
    considered whether it was consistent with the purposes and objects of the
    legislative and regulatory scheme for SROs to have the authority to discipline
    former members for misconduct they are alleged to have engaged in while they
    were members. The OSC concluded that not only did its interpretation serve the
    interests of protecting the public, but also that it would be contrary to those
    interests if former members were allowed to resign from the association in
    order to avoid discipline.</p>
  <h3>The Mootness Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC’s analysis and conclusion are certainly <i>prima facie</i> reasonable.
    However, it would have been helpful had the OSC considered and addressed the issue
    of mootness, i.e. that once the member resigns, he or she has pre-empted the
    ultimate penalty, expulsion, and made the discipline proceeding effectively
    moot. This issue was raised by the parties and had been discussed by Finlayson
    J.A. in <i>Chalmers, supra</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Chalmers</i>, as discussed earlier, this court held that the
    Toronto Stock Exchange derived its authority from statute and that the
    authority was over current members only. Although the court’s decision was made
    based on statutory interpretation and jurisdiction, the court believed the
    result was appropriate because of the mootness problem. Finlayson J.A. concluded
    that without statutory enforcement authority, membership and therefore
    subjection to the authority of the Exchange was voluntary, and therefore, the
    ultimate and only sanction for which the Exchange had unilateral recourse was
    expulsion. However, once a member resigned, the member could no longer be
    expelled as a sanction. Consequently, any further disciplinary proceeding was
    essentially moot. The court noted that although fines could be imposed, they could
    not be recovered without a civil suit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the efficacy of any potential sanction is an important factor
    in the  discussion of disciplinary jurisdiction over former members of an SRO.
    It addresses the somewhat anomalous circumstance created where both members and
    former members are subject to the same discipline process, but not the same
    sanctions if found guilty of professional misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One positive factor raised in oral argument is that along with the
    penalty of non-membership, the former member who is found guilty of misconduct
    will also bear the stigma of that finding and the SRO will be seen in the
    investment community as having acted to protect the public interest.  However,
    if a former member has nothing tangible or financial at stake, such a person may
    choose not to participate in a discipline hearing, <i>e.g.,</i> for financial
    reasons. In such a case, a finding of misconduct may not carry the same weight
    as it would where the former member had participated in the hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another factor raised in oral argument as a benefit of discipline of former
    members was that if a person can resign as a member in order to avoid
    discipline, then the person could later reapply to become a member unimpaired
    with any finding of misconduct on his or her record. In my view, this argument
    is weak at best. An application to become an Approved Person could ask whether
    a person was previously a member, the circumstances of the person’s resignation
    and whether there were any allegations of professional misconduct against the
    person. If in the face of that information, the person were to be readmitted to
    membership, the IDA could reassert its jurisdiction over the person for the
    past misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To me the most significant issue is whether there is any legal
    impediment on the IDA preventing it from imposing fines on non-members who are
    found guilty of professional misconduct, as it can on members. The IDA’s
    by-laws provide for significant fines which a discipline panel may impose upon
    a finding of misconduct. Whether the fines can be enforced by civil action is, however,
    another matter.  Clearly the imposition of a fine is a penalty.  However, it is
    a penalty that each member voluntarily agrees to in applying for membership in
    the association.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In <i>Birch v. Union of Taxation Employees</i> (2008) 93 O.R. (3d) 1
    (C.A.), (leave to appeal dismissed, [2009] S.C.C.A. No. 29), this court
    recently considered the enforceability of such fines.  The issue was whether a
    union could enforce a provision in its constitution that authorized the
    imposition of fines against its members for crossing a picket line. The court
    was asked to revisit the common law rule against the enforcement of penalty
    clauses. The court determined that it was not necessary to do so, however,
    because the amount imposed was unconscionable and therefore relief from forfeiture
    was the appropriate remedy. However, the court referred to an earlier decision, <i>Peachtree II Associates – Dallas L.P. v. 857486 Ontario Ltd. </i>(2005), 76
    O.R. (3d) 362 (C.A.), where the court made <i>obiter </i>comment in favour of
    merging the two concepts of penalty clause and relief from forfeiture.  The
    idea was to treat penalty clauses on the basis that relief can be granted where
    the penalty is unconscionable, but that otherwise, the penalty that had been
    agreed to by contract would be enforced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the IDA is able to impose the same significant fines when
    disciplining former members as it can when disciplining members and if those
    fines are legally collectable, then expulsion or removal of a person from
    membership in an SRO would not be the ultimate or necessarily the only
    significant disciplinary penalty that could be imposed on former members.  This
    would make discipline proceedings against a former member as effective and relevant
    as proceedings against a current member and would address the mootness issue
    and the concern that Finlayson J.A. raised in <i>Chalmers</i> about the
    efficacy of disciplining former members.</p>
  <h3>(4)       Conclusion and the Effect of the
    Decision of the Commission for the Future</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the conclusion of the OSC is reasonable and should be upheld.
    I would therefore set aside the decision of the majority of the Divisional Court and affirm the decision of the minority. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that, in his dissenting reasons in the Divisional Court, Carnwath
    J. found that the decision of the OSC was not only reasonable, it was correct.
    Carnwath J. may have had two purposes for making this comment, which was
    clearly beyond the scope of the question before the court on appeal. The first
    may have been to praise the OSC by saying that although the standard of review
    is only reasonableness, it did better than come to a reasonable conclusion, it
    came to the right conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second reason is potentially more jurisprudentially significant. If
    the decision of the OSC is correct, it means that it is precedential, binding
    on the OSC in future cases, subject to the OSC’s own jurisprudence on <i>stare
    decisis</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having said that, the issue of whether the effect of the OSC’s decision
    when it is interpreting its home statute as a matter of law is precedential is
    an important one. Although the court reviews the decision on the reasonableness
    standard, the OSC has determined as a matter of law the correct interpretation
    of a provision of its home statute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue was recently raised in this court by Juriansz J.A. in <i>Abdoulrab
    v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board)</i>, 2009 ONCA 491, where it was argued
    that the OLRB had developed two conflicting lines of authority interpreting the
    same statutory provision. It was argued that even if each on its own could be
    found to be reasonable, it would not be reasonable for a court to uphold both.
    Juriansz J.A. stated the problem this way at para. 48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From a common sense perspective, it is difficult to
    accept that two truly contradictory interpretations of the same statutory
    provision can both be upheld as reasonable. If two interpretations of the same
    statutory provision are truly contradictory, it is difficult to envisage that
    both would fall within the range of acceptable outcomes. More importantly, it
    seems incompatible with the rule of law that two contradictory interpretations
    of the same provision of a public statute, by which citizens order their lives,
    could both be accepted as reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, Juriansz J.A. found it unnecessary to resolve the issue
    because he found there were not two conflicting lines of authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Juriansz J.A. that it accords with the rule of law that a
    public statute that applies equally to all affected citizens should have a
    universally accepted interpretation. It follows that where a statutory tribunal
    has interpreted its home statute as a matter of law, the fact that on appeal or
    judicial review the standard of review is reasonableness does not change the
    precedential effect of the decision for the tribunal. Whether a court has had
    the opportunity to declare the decision to be correct according to judicially
    applicable principles should not affect its precedential status. As in <i>Abdoulrab</i>,
    it is not necessary to decide the issue in this case. However, I note that the
    Intervenor, the Mutual Fund Dealers Association, another SRO recognized under
    the Act, supported the appeal on the basis that the result would apply to it as
    well.</p>
  <h3>(3)         Ordering the OSC to make a Declaration</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the result, it is not necessary to address this issue.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Divisional Court
    and affirm the decision of the Ontario Securities Commission. Costs of the
    appeal to the IDA. The OSC does not seek costs. If the parties are unable to
    agree on the amount payable by the respondent, they may make brief written
    submissions, the appellant’s within 10 days of release of these reasons and the
    respondent’s within seven days thereafter.</p>
