style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals an order that it pay costs to the respondents, nine
    individuals arrested in what is described as a major gang takedown involving
    the arrest and detention of approximately one hundred persons.  The Crown had
    made no arrangement to ensure that the arrested gang members would be brought
    before a judge within twenty-four hours of their arrest or to ensure that bail
    hearings would be heard within the time prescribed by law.  More than twenty-four hours after the takedown, eighty-six detainees were brought before a
    single bail court.  Predictably, the bail hearings were adjourned for weeks
    rather than the statutorily prescribed period of three days.  The respondents
    applied for <i>habeas corpus</i> to secure their legal rights, and earlier
    dates were eventually arranged.  The judge hearing the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications
    found that “what has occurred to date in this case is improper and it is
    unacceptable” and ordered the Crown to pay the respondents’ costs of the <i>habeas
    corpus</i> applications.  For the following reasons, I would dismiss the Crown’s
    appeal. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 13, 2007, approximately 1200 officers from the Toronto Police
    Service conducted a major police takedown of the Driftwood Crips gang. 
    Approximately 100 gang affiliates were arrested.  The gang had allegedly been
    involved in trafficking firearms and drugs, as well as acts of extreme
    violence.  The takedown followed a lengthy police investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 14, 2007, more than 80 arrested persons, including the
    respondents, were brought before the Metro West bail court for their first
    appearance.  As the takedown had occurred early on the morning of June 13, the
    detainees had thus not been brought before a justice within 24 hours, as
    required by s. 503(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  No arrangements had been
    made by the police or by the Crown before the takedown to ensure that there
    would be adequate time and resources in the bail court to accommodate such an
    unusually large number of accused in a single day.  The Crown was granted an
    adjournment on all matters to review the files, and a hearing was held on June
    18 to set dates for the bail hearings.  Some of the bail hearings were set for
    the earliest available dates in June and July, well beyond the three-day
    adjournment permitted by s. 516(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  One of the
    respondents received a hearing date of June 20, while the others all received
    dates between the days of July 4 and July 12, which were 21 to 29 days after
    the arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 15, eight of the respondents and three other detainees, all
    represented by the same counsel, brought applications for <i>habeas corpus</i> to secure either their immediate release or earlier dates for their bail
    hearings.  The <i>habeas corpus</i> applications were returnable on June 19. 
    The ninth respondent, represented by another counsel, filed an identical
    application for <i>habeas corpus</i>, also returnable June 19. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 19, the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications were adjourned at the
    request of the Crown.  At the urging of the judge dealing with the matter, the
    Crown arranged for earlier dates for the bail hearings.  Several bail hearings
    were scheduled for the next day, although the nine respondents received dates
    ranging from June 22 to June 29.  These arrangements required the opening of a
    weekend bail court.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>habeas corpus</i> applications were heard and decided on June 21. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the respondents’ rights under s. 503(1)(a)
    to be brought before a court no later that 24 hours after their arrest had been
    violated: “…the accused should have been brought before the court on June 13.  No
    defensible reason is given for why that did not occur.  The sheer number of
    persons arrested does not provide a justification for failure to abide by the
    requirements of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the more serious breach of the
    respondents’ rights was the violation of s. 516(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which stipulates that a person is not be remanded in custody for a period of
    more than three days pending a bail hearing, unless that person consents to a
    longer period.  The application judge noted that both the letter and the spirit
    of ss. 503(1)(a) and 516(1) were to ensure that any person who is arrested has
    an early opportunity to have a judge review the detention and determine whether
    its continuation is warranted.  The application judge described these rights as
    “among the most important provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i>”, observed
    that they protect the detainee’s right to liberty, and noted that they are fortified
    by both ss. 10(c) and 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>, which guarantee the right to <i>habeas corpus</i> and the right not to be denied reasonable bail without
    just cause, respectively.  As noted above, the application judge found that “what
    has occurred to date in this case is improper and it is unacceptable.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the Crown’s submission that the failure
    to comply with ss. 503(1)(a) and 516(1) could be explained on the basis that
    those provisions were not designed to handle large scale investigations
    involving a major takedown of this kind.  He observed that if that is the case,
    the <i>Criminal Code </i>should be amended, just as it had been amended to
    create the criminal organization offences: “[u]ntil that happens, however, the
    requirements of those sections must be respected.”  The application judge added
    that, given the widespread media coverage that often accompanied police
    operations of this kind, it was “especially important that the judicial system
    be seen as dealing fairly and impartially” with such matters.  He observed that
    this was a carefully planned operation many months in the making:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is simply no excuse for the court system not
    to be ready to properly process these people and in a manner that ensures that
    their fundamental rights are respected.  All that is required is a reasonable
    amount of attention and planning, along with a degree of advance notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the Crown’s contention that the failure
    to plan for the inevitable influx of a large number of arrested persons could
    be excused because of security concerns arising from any disclosure that a
    large-scale arrest was expected. There was no evidence on that point and, as a
    practical matter, sufficient court resources could be arranged without
    compromising police operations.  In any event, “if there are security issues
    within the court system, then those issues should be addressed directly.  Such
    concerns cannot be used as an excuse for treading on the constitutional rights
    of accused persons.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the problem arose due to a lack of resources, the
    application judge held that that “cannot be relied upon as a reason not to
    respect constitutional rights.”  If a decision is made to apply resources to
    the “front end” of the criminal justice process, which involves the
    investigation of crimes and the arrest of suspected individuals, “they must
    equally be applied to the back end of that process, otherwise the system will
    not function properly.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied there has been a failure to respect
    the rights of these applicants through the failure of the Crown to ensure that
    they were able to have a bail hearing at the first opportunity that the accused
    were prepared to conduct such a hearing. Those rights include the right to
    liberty under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, the right against arbitrary detention
    under s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>, and the right to bail under s. 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the remedy of ordering the respondents’
    immediate release was not appropriate.  However, he did make an order requiring
    the Crown to ensure that the bail hearings were held on the earliest available
    date.  He also made the order which is at issue on this appeal, finding that
    the remedy of costs against the Crown was appropriate in the circumstances.  He
    found that the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications should not have been required,
    and that the situation that had ensued and the violation of the rights of the
    respondents, was entirely predictable:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown has had ample opportunity to develop a
    procedure to deal with the consequences of such investigations, and, more
    specifically, to ensure that the necessary courtrooms and judicial officers are
    available when needed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Such a procedure was not properly in place for this
    project. Whatever the reason for that failure, it cannot be blamed on a new or
    novel situation. The seriousness of that failure for these accused cannot be
    understated. It is also apparent that but for these applications, the bail
    hearings for these accused would have been even further delayed than they
    already are.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge accordingly ordered costs pursuant to s. 24(1) of
    the <i>Charter</i>,<i> </i>initially set at $3000 to each applicant.  This was
    subsequently varied after further submissions to $2000 per applicant for a
    total of $18,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s. 676.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, and raises two issues:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the application judge err by ordering the Crown to pay costs?</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the application judge err in the amount of costs he awarded?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>1.  Did
    the application judge err by ordering the Crown to pay costs?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The traditional rule is that an accused person in a criminal case,
    whether successful or unsuccessful, ordinarily is not entitled to costs: <i>R.
    v. M.(C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 97.  It is only where the
    accused can show at a minimum “a marked and unacceptable departure from the reasonable
    standards expected of the prosecution” that a costs order will be made: <i>R.
    v. 974649 Ontario Inc</i>., [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575 (“<i>974649</i>”), at para. 87. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has been recognized in many cases that while costs awards in favour
    of the winning party are a familiar feature of civil proceedings, they are rare
    in criminal cases: see recent decisions by this court in <i>R. v. Ciarniello</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 561 (“<i>Ciarniello</i>”), at paras. 32-33; <i>Canada</i><i> (Attorney General) v. Foster</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 59, at paras. 62-69;
    and <i>R. v. Tiffin </i>(2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 575, at paras. 94-98.  This
    difference derives from the different purposes of civil and criminal
    proceedings.  Civil cases are concerned with compensation and the efficient
    resolution of disputes.  Costs awards compensate the successful litigant, at
    least partially, for the expense of litigation.  Costs awards also serve as an
    important judicial tool to control proceedings, discourage unreasonable or
    inappropriate behaviour, and encourage out of court settlements.  The threat of
    adverse costs awards discourages unnecessary or frivolous litigation and
    encourages parties to settle their disputes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal proceedings are not brought by one party to vindicate a private
    interest but in the interest of the public at large: see <i>Berry v. British
    Transport Commission</i>, [1962] 1 Q.B. 306 (Eng. C.A.), at p. 327: “[a] plaintiff
    brings an action for his own ends and to benefit himself; it is therefore just
    that if he loses he should pay the costs.  A prosecutor brings proceedings in
    the public interest, and so should be treated more tenderly.”  There is a
    concern that if costs awards were routine, the discretion of the Crown when
    acting in the public interest would be unduly influenced or fettered: see <i>R.
    v. Robinson</i> (1999), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Alta. C.A.), at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reasons for limiting costs are that the Crown
    is not an ordinary litigant, does not win or lose criminal cases, and conducts
    prosecutions and makes decisions respecting prosecutions in the public
    interest. In the absence of proof of misconduct, an award of costs against the
    Crown would be a harsh penalty for a Crown officer carrying out such public
    duties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here the respondents seek costs as a remedy for the breach of their <i>Charter</i> rights pursuant to s. 24(1), and submit that costs are “appropriate and just in
    the circumstances” within the meaning of that section.  In <i>Ciarniello, </i>we
    summarized the jurisprudence relating to costs as a <i>Charter</i> remedy at
    paras. 35-6:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The traditional aversion to costs in criminal cases
    is a product of the pre-<i>Charter</i> era.  <i>Because of their constitutional
    status, Charter rights have a higher claim to judicial protection than non-Charter
    rights and s. 24(1) entitles the victim of a Charter breach to an appropriate
    remedy</i>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the other hand, the authorities are clear that
    this does not mean that costs will be routinely ordered in favour of accused
    persons who establish <i>Charter</i> violations. Galligan J.A. cautioned in <i>R.
    v. Pawlowski</i> that costs awards in favour of an accused will be “rare”.  As
    a general rule, when claimed by an accused, absent Crown misconduct, costs will
    not be an “appropriate and just” <i>Charter</i> remedy: see <i>R. v. 974649
    Ontario Inc., supra,</i> at para. 87; <i>R. v. Leduc</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 2974,
    176 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para. 161; <i>R. v. Robinson, supra.</i>  In <i>R.
    v. Hallstone Products Ltd.,</i> [2000] O.J. No. 1051 (S.C.J.), at para. 33,
    LaForme J. suggested that the expanded jurisdiction to award costs against the
    Crown as a s. 24(1) remedy for a <i>Charter</i> breach in cases not involving
    Crown misconduct requires something that is “rare” or “unique” that “must at
    least result in something akin to an extreme hardship on the defendant.” [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Supreme Court observed in <i>974649</i>, at paras. 80-81, “[i]n
    recent years, costs awards have attained more prominence as an effective remedy
    in criminal cases” for breaches of the <i>Charter</i>, especially in relation
    to disclosure obligations.  Costs awards “are integrally connected to the court’s
    control of its trial process” and, in disclosure cases, may allow the court to
    avoid the extremes of either a stay of proceedings or a mere adjournment.  Costs
    may be “the only effective remedy to control [the court’s] process and
    recognize the harm incurred, even in cases involving unjustified and flagrant
    disregard for the accused’s rights” and such awards are “a quintessential
    example” of the development of appropriate remedies “essential to the
    meaningful enforcement of <i>Charter</i> rights through the s. 24 guarantee”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept the appellant’s central submission before us that the
    application judge failed to make the findings required to bring the Crown’s
    conduct within the category of “a marked and unacceptable departure from the reasonable
    standards expected of the prosecution”.  In my view, the findings by the
    application judge bring this case within that standard as it applies to cases
    involving the violation of <i>Charter</i> rights, as been in the authorities that
    I have discussed above.  The application judge rested his decision to award
    costs on the basis of a systemic failure on the part of the prosecution to
    respect both the statutory and <i>Charter</i> rights of the respondents.  Those
    findings were fully supported by the record.  He aptly described the conduct of
    the Crown and the situation it produced as “improper and unacceptable.”  The
    cause of that improper and unacceptable situation was the failure of the Crown
    to make the necessary arrangements to have sufficient court resources available
    to deal with the known fact that there would be a massive intake of detained
    persons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the application judge observed, the arrest of the respondents was
    part of an operation that involved careful and detailed planning.  The central
    element of that careful and detailed plan was the sudden and sweeping arrest of
    a large number of suspects.  The execution of such a plan was bound to
    overwhelm the ordinary capacity of the bail court to handle those arrested in a
    timely fashion.  Regrettably, however, the otherwise careful and detailed plan
    entirely ignored the obvious fact that unless something was done to ensure that
    adequate court resources would be available on the morning of the sweeping
    arrests, chaos and the denial of the statutory and <i>Charter</i> rights of
    those arrested was inevitable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents should not have been required to bring <i>habeas corpus</i> applications to secure their statutory and <i>Charter</i> rights.  The
    situation that produced their need to resort to this remedy was entirely predictable. 
    It could and should have been avoided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge was quite rightly alarmed by what had occurred.  His
    response to the situation was measured and very much in the spirit of the
    rationale for costs awards in criminal matters identified in <i>974649</i> as
    an appropriate remedy to avoid extremes.  He denied the remedy of release and
    did what he could to have the bail hearings expedited.  However, he had
    identified a systemic failure in the processing of the respondents post-arrest
    which resulted in a serious violation of their rights, and he was entitled to
    mark his disapproval of what had occurred by ordering the Crown the pay the
    costs of proceedings that should never have been required.  While the
    appropriate remedy in most cases involving delayed bail hearings will be to direct
    or conduct an expedited hearing, the application judge found this to be an
    exceptional case calling for an exceptional remedy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In argument before us, the Crown laid great emphasis on the fact that
    this was a prosecution that involved serious charges against dangerous
    individuals.  That, however, cannot justify any departure from the rights
    secured by the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the by the <i>Charter</i>.  Quite apart
    from the need to respect the rights of those eventually found to be guilty,
    sweeps of this kind will often bring before the court bystanders who were
    simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add that I have no doubt that, as was submitted on this appeal,
    the unfortunate Crown attorney who found himself in the bail court on the day
    the predictable storm hit did his best to cope with an impossible situation.  Likewise,
    the Crown attorney faced with the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications made
    commendable efforts to arrange earlier dates for the bail hearings, albeit
    dates outside the statutorily prescribed period.  However, it is not the
    conduct of those Crown attorneys that formed the basis for the costs order.  The
    submission made before us that that no costs should be awarded because the
    Crown attorneys in bail court and at the hearing of the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications made best efforts to deal with a bad situation simply misses the point
    of both the application judge’s findings and the rationale for his award of
    costs.  While it may not be possible to lay responsibility for the violation of
    constitutional rights at the feet of any particular prosecutor, that does not
    preclude a costs award to sanction the failure of the Crown to take any steps
    to avoid the entirely predictable violation of the statutory and <i>Charter</i> rights of the respondents that occurred in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs in criminal cases have always been and still remain an exceptional
    remedy to be awarded only in “rare” cases.  I am not persuaded that the trial
    judge erred in finding that the most unusual circumstances of this case brought
    it within the exceptional category calling for an award of costs.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>2.  Did
    the application judge err in the amount of costs he awarded?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that the amount eventually fixed by the application judge
    for costs in the amount of $2,000 per applicant was unreasonable.  While there
    was obvious duplication in much of the work involved, counsel were required on
    very short notice to prepare, serve and file nine applications and to prepare
    for and attend three separate hearings.</p>
