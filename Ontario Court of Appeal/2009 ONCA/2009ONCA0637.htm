  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party, Broadview Networks Inc. (Broadview), seeks relief that
    will allow PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the interim receiver, to sell the
    assets of Natural Convergence Inc. (NCI) to Broadview.  The respondent, BluArc
    Communications Inc. (BluArc) opposes that relief.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In separate orders on July 31, 2009, the application judge appointed the
    receiver (the Receivership Order) and ordered the asset sale to Broadview (the
    Sale Order).  BluArc appealed from these orders.  On appeal, the Orders were
    stayed automatically pursuant to s. 195 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (BIA).  Broadview moves to cancel the stay.  MMV Financial Inc.
    (MMV), a secured creditor, supports Broadview’s motion.  PwC also filed
    materials and made submissions on this motion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All parties agreed during argument that the appeal should be expedited. 
    Accordingly, the appeal is expedited to be heard by this court on September 10,
    2009.  Forty-five minutes are allotted to the appellant BluArc and 40 minutes are
    allotted to the respondent Broadview.  The parties agree they will be able to
    perfect the appeal in a timely manner because their facta for this motion can
    be readily adapted for the purposes of the appeal.  However, no party to this
    motion filed the material that was before the application judge or the
    application judge’s reasons for granting the Orders.  These materials must be
    included in the appeal book.  Subject to any other order, I also note that the
    September 10 date may, if appropriate, allow for a panel review of this decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am advised that BluArc is seeking a variation of the Orders pursuant
    to s. 187(5) of the BIA<i> </i>and the parties are scheduled to appear before
    the application judge tomorrow, September 3, 2009. BluArc advises that it will
    deliver its material for that motion today.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although BluArc appealed both the Receivership and Sale Orders, it
    became clear during argument that it did not object to PwC’s appointment as
    receiver; it merely challenged PwC’s right to proceed with the asset sale. 
    Thus, the real issue is not about the appointment of the receiver but about whether
    the sale proceeds pending the appeal.  Broadview primarily seeks cancellation
    of the automatic stay of all appealed proceedings pursuant to s. 195 of the BIA. 
    This court has a broad discretion to vary or cancel the automatic stay if “the
    appeal is not being prosecuted diligently, or for such other reason as the
    [court] may deem proper”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the moving party did not abandon its secondary “abuse of process” stay
    argument definitively, nor its argument for a stay of the appeal, neither did
    it pursue these issues in oral argument.  In any event, I see no abuse of
    process arising from BluArc’s stated intention to also bring a variation motion
    before the application judge.  Accordingly, these reasons focus on whether the
    s. 195 automatic stay should be cancelled in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the need to deliver a decision on this motion expeditiously,
    these reasons refer only to facts essential to the disposition.  However, a
    brief overview will provide some context.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NCI developed software that enabled its licensees, including Broadview
    and BluArc, to sell voice-over-internet-protocol telephone support services to
    customers.  As early as March 2008, NCI was in financial straits and began attempting
    to market its business or to secure financing.  As a way of providing financial
    assistance to NCI, Broadview purchased software licences from NCI in March 2009
    for approximately $444,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With financial problems continuing, on July 16, 2009, Broadview offered
    to purchase NCI’s assets.  NCI agreed with the terms.  The offer included a “no
    shop” provision that prohibited NCI from seeking other purchasers.  The offer
    was also said to include a premium on the purchase price.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 22, 2009, BDC Capital Inc. (BDC), a secured creditor, served a
    Notice of Intention to Enforce Security on NCI pursuant to s. 244 of the BIA.  On
    July 24, 2009, Broadview provided NCI with an unsecured loan to pay its
    remaining employees.  The remaining employees were said to be necessary to maintain
    the software’s source code.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although PwC initially asked for approval of the sale to Broadview, it
    apparently delivered an amended notice later on July 31 that simply asked the
    court for directions regarding the sale.  In its accompanying report to the
    application judge about Broadview’s offer, PwC stated that it was “uncertain as
    to the level of interest” that other parties expressed in buying NCI’s assets
    and that in the “absence of contacting” other interested parties, the receiver
    “cannot comment on the commercial reasonableness of the Agreement”.  PwC sought
    “the Court’s direction with respect to the completion of the Agreement”.  The
    application judge granted both orders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I do not have the benefit of any of the materials filed before the
    application judge, or the application judge’s reasons, the material before me
    indicates that all NCI’s senior secured creditors, including BDC and MMV and
    Comerica, agreed to the asset sale, even though the proceeds of sale would be less
    than NCI’s total indebtedness to those creditors.  No one opposed the sale. 
    While PwC’s second report, filed in this court, suggests that BDC is now
    amenable to a more open sale process, BDC did not appear on this motion.  MMV,
    the only secured creditor who did appear, continues to support the Sale Order
    made by the application judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, Broadview argues that the stay should be cancelled because
    BluArc has no standing to challenge the Orders that it has appealed.  Broadview
    describes BluArc as a “bitter bidder” and argues that the test for cancellation
    of the stay should be based on the following discussion in <i>Skyepharma PLC v.
    Hyal Pharmaceutical Corporation</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 467 (C.A.):  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[14] Although the issues considered in these cases
    are not identical to the case at bar, the reasoning applies to the issue raised
    on this appeal. If an unsuccessful prospective purchaser does not acquire an
    interest sufficient to warrant being added as a party to a motion to approve a
    sale, it follows that it does not have a right that is finally disposed of by
    an order made on that motion.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[15]     There are two main reasons why an
    unsuccessful prospective purchaser does not have a right or interest that is
    affected by a sale approval order. First, a prospective purchaser has no legal
    or proprietary right in the property being sold. Offers are submitted in a
    process in which there is no requirement that a particular offer be accepted. Orders
    appointing receivers commonly give the receiver a discretion as to which offers
    to accept and to recommend to the court for approval. The duties of the
    receiver and the court are to ensure that the sales are in the best interests
    of those with an interest in the proceeds of the sale. There is no right in a
    party who submits an offer to have the offer, even if the highest, accepted by
    either the receiver or the court: Crown Trust v. Rosenberg, supra.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[16]     Moreover, the fundamental purpose of the
    sale approval motion is to consider the best interests of the parties with a
    direct interest in the proceeds of the sale, primarily the creditors. The
    unsuccessful would be purchaser has no interest in this issue. Indeed, the
    involvement of unsuccessful prospective purchasers could seriously distract
    from this fundamental purpose by including in the motion other issues with the
    potential for delay and additional expense.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[17]&nbsp;    In making these comments, I recognize
    that a court conducting a sale approval motion is required to consider the
    integrity of the process by which the offers have been obtained and to consider
    whether there has been unfairness in the working out of that process. <i>Crown
    Trust v. Rosenberg</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Soundair Corp.</i> (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.). The examination of the sale process will in
    normal circumstances be focussed on the integrity of that process from the
    perspective of those for whose benefit it has been conducted. The inquiry into
    the integrity of the process may incidentally address the fairness of the
    process to prospective purchasers, but that in itself does not create a right
    or interest in a prospective purchaser that is affected by a sale approval
    order.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
class=bold1><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black;
font-weight:normal'>…</span></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=bold1><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
font-weight:normal'>[19]</span></span><span class=bold1><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>     </span></span>In limited circumstances, a
    prospective purchaser may become entitled to participate in a sale approval
    motion. For that to happen, it must be shown that the prospective purchaser
    acquired a legal right or interest from the circumstances of a particular sale
    process and that the nature of the right or interest is such that it could be
    adversely affected by the approval order. A commercial interest is not
    sufficient.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[20]     There is a sound policy reason for
    restricting, to the extent possible, the involvement of prospective purchasers
    in sale approval motions. There is often a measure of urgency to complete court
    approved sales. This case is a good example. When unsuccessful purchasers
    become involved, there is a potential for greater delay and additional
    uncertainty. This potential may, in some situations, create commercial leverage
    in the hands a disappointed would be purchaser which could be counterproductive
    to the best interests of those for whose benefit the sale is intended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in <i>Consumers Packaging Inc. (Re)</i> (2001), 150 O.A.C.
    384 (C.A.) this court stated at para. 7:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Further, despite its protestations to the contrary,
    it is evident that Ardagh is a disappointed bidder that obtained its security
    interest in the assets of Consumers in order to participate in their
    restructuring and obtain a controlling equity position in the restructured
    entity. There is authority from this court that an unsuccessful bidder has no
    standing to appeal or to seek leave to appeal. As a general rule, unsuccessful
    bidders do not have standing to challenge a motion to approve a sale to another
    bidder (or to appeal from an order approving the sale) because the unsuccessful
    bidders &quot;have no legal or proprietary right as technically they are not
    affected by the order&quot;: see the statement of Farley J., dealing with a
    receiver's motion to approve a sale, that is quoted with approval by O'Connor
    J.A. of this court in <i><span style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif"'>Skyepharma
    plc v. Hyal Pharmaceutical Corp.</span></i><span style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif"'> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 234 at 238 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of these authorities, Broadview asks me to conclude that
    BluArc is without standing to bring its appeal and that the appeal should be
    stayed and the s. 195 stay lifted.  Both <i>Skyepharma</i> and <i>Consumers
    Packaging</i> were heard by a panel of this court and not by a single judge
    sitting in chambers.  In my view, a single judge does not have the jurisdiction
    in the circumstances of this case to decide that an appellant lacks standing to
    bring an appeal and to stay the appeal.  To do so would be tantamount to
    quashing the appeal.  A motion to quash an appeal, which may result in the
    final disposition of the appeal, is heard by a panel of the court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An analogous situation arose in <i>1730960 Ontario Ltd</i>.<i> (Re)</i>,
    August 6, 2009, unreported (Ont. C.A. [In Chambers]).  Based on <i>Skyepharma</i>,
    Juriansz J.A. was not satisfied in that case that the “prospective purchaser [who
    moved to stay a sale order] has any standing to bring this appeal”.  Since “the
    appeal is destined to be quashed”, he dismissed the motion on the basis there
    was “no serious issue to be decided on the appeal”.  Juriansz J.A. would also have
    dismissed the motion on the basis of the merits of the appeal, irreparable harm
    and the balance of convenience.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BluArc argues that the stay should not be lifted based on the relevant
    criteria referenced by Juriansz J.A. in <i>1730960 Ontario Ltd</i>. and discussed
    in <i>After Eight Interiors Inc. v. Glenwood Homes Inc. </i>(2006), 391 A.R.
    202 (C.A.) at paras. 5-6, which provides for a variation of the test set out in <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (A.G.), </i>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 311.  The criteria
    include whether there is a serious issue to be appealed, whether the moving
    party would suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not lifted, and whether the
    moving party would suffer greater harm than the responding party if the stay is
    not lifted.  At the same time, in view of the broad discretion provided in s.
    195 of the BIA, <i>After Eight</i> adopts a contextual approach. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A consideration of these criteria necessarily includes consideration of
    whether the particular appellant can succeed on the appeal.  Broadview has
    persuaded me that, whatever the merits of the underlying issues, it is highly unlikely
    that BluArc has the requisite standing.  BluArc is neither a creditor nor a
    contingent creditor.  At most, BluArc is a licensee of software.  As such, it is
    entitled to the remedies set out in its licence.  That licence requires NCI to
    provide the software’s source code for the software to an Escrow Agent (the
    Agent) and for the Agent to provide the source code to BluArc in certain
    circumstances, which may well include the circumstances that have occurred in
    the past month.  BluArc sought the source code from the Escrow Agent.  The
    Agent declined to provide it on the basis of an e-mail from PwC that its consent
    was required to any such release.  Apparently, BluArc has not sought PwC’s
    consent, which may simply be because the Receivership Order is currently
    stayed.  In any event, both in its material and in its submissions, Broadview
    has taken the position that it would not interfere with the Escrow Agent’s
    obligation to comply with the licences because the licences are not part of the
    assets that Broadview has agreed to purchase. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that at its highest, BluArc has a licence agreement with NCI that,
    if breached, will give BluArc a potential cause of action against NCI.  In my
    view, such a potential cause of action would not appear to warrant BluArc being
    added as a party to a motion to approve a sale of NCI’s assets.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, on the material before me, BluArc’s main interest in the
    sale appears to be that of a belated and disappointed potential purchaser.  It
    does not appear to have a legal or proprietary right to either participate in
    the sale process or attack that process.  In coming to this conclusion, I
    observe that the Sale Order proceeded with the consent of all secured creditors
    and without opposition from any entity entitled to notice of the application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of BluArc’s agreement to fund the costs of a continuing stay
    pending appeal, Broadview has not persuaded me that it will suffer irreparable
    harm if the stay remains in force for the next eight days.  However, Broadview
    has persuaded me that it does not appear that BluArc will suffer any undue harm
    if the stay is lifted.  Indeed, it appears that BluArc will continue to have its
    contractual recourse to obtain the source codes that it claims are its primary
    interest.  In any event, if I am wrong, it may well be that BluArc will be able
    to “unscramble the egg” if a panel of the court so decides next Thursday.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I dismiss the responding party’s cross-motion and
    grant the moving party’s motion to cancel the stay under s. 195 of the BIA. 
    This disposition, of course, does not preclude the application judge from
    proceeding with the scheduled variation motion tomorrow.  As well, since these
    reasons provide only a preliminary view of the matter, it does not dispose of
    the underlying appeal scheduled to be heard in eight days. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of the appearance in this court on September 10, 2009, counsel
    are directed to file the appeal book and appellant’s factum by 4:30 pm on
    Friday, September 4, 2009 and the respondent’s factum by noon on Tuesday,
    September 8, 2009.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of this motion are awarded to Broadview fixed in the amount of
    $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
