  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, the St. Clair Region Conservation
    Authority, appeals from the judgment of <span class=SpellE>Tausendfreund</span> J.  The appellant was held liable under
    s. 3(1) of the <i>Occupiers’ Liability Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2 (the “Act”) for damages suffered by the respondent,
    &nbsp;Jo-Anne Schneider, in an accident she sustained while cross-country
    skiing at <span class=SpellE>Coldstream</span> Park.  The trial judge held Ms. Schneider to be 20
    percent <span class=SpellE>contributorily</span> negligent and reduced the
    damages award against the appellant accordingly.  The trial judge also awarded damages to Robert
    Butcher, Ms. Schneider’s husband and also a respondent on this appeal, for his derivative
    claim brought pursuant to the <i>Family Law
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1) of the Act imposes on the occupier of
    premises a duty to take reasonable care to see that persons and their property
    are reasonably safe while on the occupier’s premises.  Where a person willingly assumes the risks of
    entering premises, s.&nbsp;4(1) of the Act replaces the duty established by s.
    3(1) and substitutes a lesser duty on the occupier “to not create a danger with
    the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage” and “to not act with reckless
    disregard” with respect to the person or his/her property. Subsection 4(3) of
    the Act is a deeming provision such that in certain listed circumstances, a
    person who enters the types of premises outlined in s. 4(4) is deemed to have
    willingly assumed the associated risks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central question in this appeal is whether the
    trial judge erred in concluding that the premises where the accident occurred did
    not fall within the types of premises outlined in s. 4(4).  If so, the next question is whether the trial
    judge also erred in finding that the appellant nonetheless failed to meet the
    lesser duty established in s. 4(1) because it had “displayed a reckless
    disregard for the safety of the users of the park”.  For their part, the respondents bring a
    cross-appeal, challenging the trial judge’s finding that Ms. Schneider was <span
class=SpellE>contributorily</span> negligent and the trial judge’s failure to
    award damages for lost wages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the trial judgment and dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <h3><span class=SpellE>Coldstream</span> Conservation Area</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the owner of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <span
 class=SpellE>Coldstream</span>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park
    (the “Park”), located in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Township
    of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Middlesex Centre (the
    “Township”). The Park is approximately 67 acres in size and forms part of the <span
class=SpellE>Coldstream</span> Conservation Area.
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <span
 class=SpellE>Coldstream</span>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake
    (the “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lake”) is situated within the boundaries
    of the Park. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Park is bounded by Quaker Lane on one side and <span
class=SpellE>Ilderton</span> Road on the other.  The trial judge found that several houses are located on these roads.  Although there is some dispute between the
    parties as to the level of residential and commercial development surrounding
    the Park, it is sufficient for the purposes of these reasons to state that the
    surrounding community is not urban and there is no residential or commercial
    development within the borders of the Park.  The Park includes a trail system, marked by signs and maps.  Part of the trail system is a wooden
    boardwalk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has encouraged the use of the Park by the
    general public, free of charge, for recreational purposes.  It is maintained by the Township and, during
    the summer months, the public makes use of its pavilion, picnic grounds,
    playground area, designated walking trails, soccer fields, and toilet
    facilities.  Recreational programs, such
    as camping and a children’s summer program, are also offered by a group of
    local residents who use the Park for these purposes.  From May to October, the Township facilitates
    these recreational uses by cutting the grass, laying out the soccer pitches,
    removing the garbage and maintaining the washroom facilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the winter months, the Park is used by local
    residents for other recreational activities, including hiking, tobogganing,
    skating, hockey and cross-country skiing.  The Township does not perform any maintenance activities in the Park
    from November to April and the toilet facilities are closed.  During these months, none of the trails are
    groomed for skiing and the ice surface on the lake is not maintained.</p>
  <h3>The Accident</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Schneider is a professor of kinesiology and women’s
    studies at the
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University of
    <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">
    Western Ontario in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    and a former Olympic athlete. On January 30, 2005 she and her husband took
    their three sons cross-country skiing in the Park.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A five foot <span class=SpellE>berm</span> sits along
    the shoreline of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lake.  While following ski tracks and footprints
    along the wooden boardwalk, Ms. Schneider and her family came to the foot of
    the <span class=SpellE>berm</span>.  When
    they reached this point, Ms. Schneider left the trail and followed ski marks leading
    to the top of the <span class=SpellE>berm</span>.  For safety reasons, she told her sons to wait
    while she skied down the <span class=SpellE>berm</span> to the ice surface,
    with them to follow.  Ms. Schneider did
    so and, before she was able to stop, struck her ski on a concrete wall hidden
    below the snow. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concrete wall was built by the appellant with a
    metal slide gate which, when manually lifted, permits water to flow into an
    underground pipe for the purpose of powering a decorative water wheel.  The metal slide gate and water wheel had been
    inoperable for several years.  The
    concrete wall rises approximately six inches above water level but was not
    visible at the time of the accident due to snow cover. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the accident, Ms. Schneider sustained a
    compound fracture of three bones in her right ankle.  She was unable to walk or stand for very long,
    and could not return to work until mid-October 2005.  In 2006, Ms. Schneider was able to re-engage
    in some, but not all, of her sporting activities.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that the appellant was bound by
    the duty of care established in s. 3(1) of the Act.  The lesser duty of care established by s. 4(1)
    did not apply because the Park did not come within the categories of premises
    listed in s. 4(4). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge first considered
    whether the Park, including the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lake, were
    rural premises as defined in ss. 4(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the
    Act.  Using a common sense approach to
    the meaning of “rural premises”, he concluded that it was not.  It was apparent that the Park had been
    developed into a recreational park. Based on the evidence, he concluded that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lake was not a farm pond, that the Park was
    not used for agricultural purposes, and that it was not a vacant, undeveloped
    or wilderness area. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on this court’s decision in <span class=SpellE><i>Moloney</i></span><i> v. Parry Sound (Town) </i>(2000), 184 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 121, the
    trial judge further found that the Park was “much more than a recreational
    trail” and thus did not fall within s. 4(4)(f) of the Act: <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    28.  Specifically, he noted that while
    the Park did contain marked recreational trails, the concrete wall with which Ms.
    Schneider collided was not situated on one of these trails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge went on to find that, in the
    event that he was wrong and the Park did fall within s. 4(4) of the Act, the
    appellant had “displayed a reckless disregard for the safety of the users of
    the park” by not marking the concrete wall with “some form of signage”: <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 31.  Therefore,
    he held that “s. 4(1) does not apply to dislodge from application to these
    facts the duty of care imposed by s.&nbsp;3(1)”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    21. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the appellant breached
    its duty under s. 3(1) of the Act by failing “to exercise care against dangers
    that were sufficiently and normally <span class=SpellE>forseeable</span>”: <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 33.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Damages were assessed against the appellant in the
    amount of $115,170.58, less 20 percent to take account of the contributory
    negligence on the part of Ms. Schneider.  The contributory negligence finding was based on the trial judge’s
    assessment that cross-country skiing has possible dangerous consequences.</p>

    common law, persons entering an occupier’s premises were traditionally defined
    as invitees, licensees or trespassers, and the duty of care owed by the
    occupier to such persons was determined on this basis.  In 1980, the legislature enacted the <i>Occupier’s Liability Act</i>, S.O. 1980, c.
    14,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    specifically, was intended to encourage occupiers to make their lands available
    to the public for recreational use. I agree. In a discussion paper published by
    the Ministry of the Attorney General prior to the enactment of the Act in 1980, <i>Discussion Paper on Occupiers’ Liability
    and Trespass to Property </i>(Toronto: Policy Development Division, 1979), the
    Attorney General highlighted the tension between the growing participation of
    urban residents in outdoor recreational activities and the outdated scheme
    governing occupiers’ liability, at p. 7:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    desirable growth of outdoor recreational activities has had some undesirable
    effects.  Urban residents have flocked in
    ever increasing numbers to the countryside. In the countryside, farmers and
    other occupiers of land have become fearful of being sued for damages by
    persons who might be injured while engaged in recreational activities on their
    land.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Attorney General also expressed the concern that the prevailing common law
    approach to occupiers’ liability penalized the benevolent occupier, by imposing
    a greater duty of care in relation to persons permitted to use the land than to
    trespassers. At p. 7 of the <i>Discussion
    Paper</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[A]n
    occupier owes a greater duty to persons he permits to use his land for
    recreational activities than he does to trespassers.  This penalizes the occupier who is willing to
    permit recreational activities on his land. It discourages benevolence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Attorney General circulated a draft of the proposed Act as Appendix B to the <i>Discussion Paper</i>.  Much like s. 4 of the current Act now does, the
    proposed legislation suggested imposing a lesser duty of care on occupiers of
    certain types of premises, including “marked recreational trails”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Imposing
    a lesser duty of care on occupiers of recreational trails of all kinds appears
    to have been justified on the basis that the existence and availability of
    these trails was heavily dependent on the use of private lands: see <i>Discussion Paper</i>, at p. 7.  As a result, changes to the law limiting occupiers’
    liability were warranted to encourage occupiers to make their land available
    for recreational activities.  This
    approach was considered reasonable because, as explained in the <i>Discussion Paper</i>, at p. 10:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[P]<span
class=SpellE>ersons</span> permitted to use the land, without <span
class=GramE>charge,</span> for recreational activities…have usually assumed
    that they are responsible for their own injuries, though the existing law would
    technically consider them as licensees. They are grateful for the privilege
    being extended to them. The proposal that such entrants would assume their own
    risks seems to accord with usual expectations of those who pursue recreational
    activities on private lands.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    their current iteration, ss. 4(1), 4(3)(c) and 4(4)(f) of the Act work together
    such that a person who enters recreational trails, reasonably marked by notice
    as such, for the purpose of a recreational activity and without payment of any fee
    is deemed to have willingly assumed the risks associated with the activity. In
    such cases, the duty of the occupier to the person is “to not create a danger
    with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to the person or his or her
    property and to not act with reckless disregard of the presence of the person
    or his or her property.” </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, it is clear that the legislature intended that s. 4 of the Act encourage
    occupiers to promote the use of recreational trails on their land by members of
    the public. Against this backdrop, the central question on this appeal is
    whether the trial judge erred in finding that the Park was not a recreational
    trail for the purposes of s. 4(4)(f) and that the lesser duty of care
    established by s. 4(1) did not apply.</span></p>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Decision of the trial judge</span></u><u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the Park had a network of
    marked trails and that, on the day that Ms. Schneider was injured, she and her
    family were cross-country skiing along the wooden boardwalk situated on one of
    these trails.  He found, however, that
    the injury occurred when Ms. Schneider left the trail to ski down a <span
class=SpellE>berm</span> and onto a frozen pond.  According to the trial judge, s. 4(4<span
class=GramE>)(</span>f) of the Act did not apply to the facts of this case for
    two reasons.  First, the concrete wall
    that Ms. Schneider collided with “was in the lake and not on a recreational
    trail”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 28.  Second, in reliance on this court’s decision in <span class=SpellE><i>Moloney</i></span>, he determined that “
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Coldstream
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Park was, in fact, much more than a
    recreational trail”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 28.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in so concluding.  As I have stated, the objective of s. 4(4<span
class=GramE>)(</span>f) of the Act is to encourage landowners to allow
    recreational use of marked trails on their lands by imposing on them a lesser
    duty of care.  It would make little sense
    to limit this lesser duty of care to users when they remain on the marked trail,
    only to impose a greater duty of care when they venture off the trail.  As the occupier has no effective way of
    policing the use of these trails, this would, in effect, impose a duty on the occupier
    to make the off-trail portions of his or her property safer than the trail
    itself.  This would defeat the purpose of
    the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I do not view <span class=SpellE><i>Moloney</i></span> as having any application
    to the facts of this case.  The situation
    in <span class=SpellE><i>Moloney</i></span> was quite different.  In that case, the
    injury occurred on a portion of a fitness path that was also a paved roadway
    used regularly by cars for access to and egress from a parking lot.  In those circumstances it was reasonable for
    the court to conclude, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 2, that “the regular
    use of the roadway by vehicles precluded the application of s. 4 of the Act to this
    part of the fitness path.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record before us suggests that the
    recreational trail being used by Ms. Schneider was used for any purpose other
    than recreation.  For that matter, there
    is nothing in the record to indicate that the area of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lake
    where the injury occurred was used at that time of year for any purpose at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also do not consider it of any relevance that, during
    the summer months, other portions of the Park were used for various
    recreational activities such as soccer and picnicking.  In the winter the Park was essentially closed,
    in the sense that the appellant and the Township did not carry out any
    maintenance activities or have any presence in the Park.  The fact that the appellant and the Township
    allowed, and in fact promoted, the use of the Park’s recreational trails in winter
    for cross-country skiing is precisely what s.&nbsp; 4(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>f)
    was intended to encourage.  Ms. Schneider
    acknowledged that the reason she was on the property was to cross-country ski
    and that she had begun her trip on one of the marked recreational trails.  It was when she ventured off the trail that
    she was injured.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no suggestion that, in the winter months, the
    area where the injury occurred was designed for any particular use other than being
    a general area within which the trails used by cross-country skiers are
    located.  The fact that other portions of
    the Park are the site for other types of activities, principally in the May to
    October period, does not change the nature of the area or the nature of the use
    where the injury occurred.  In my view,
    the trial judge erred in concluding that s. 4(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>f)
    did not apply in this case.</p>
  <h3>1. (<span
class=GramE>b</span>)   Did the trial
    judge err in finding that the appellant acted with reckless disregard for the
    safety of users of the park?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge found that the lesser duty
    imposed by s. 4(1) of the Act did not apply, he nonetheless went on to find
    that, “[s]<span class=SpellE>hould</span> my conclusion be incorrect, I
    nevertheless find that s. 4(1) does not apply to dislodge from application to
    these facts the duty of care imposed by s. 3(1) of the Act on the occupier of
    Coldstream Park”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not clear to me what the trial judge meant by s.
    4(1) not dislodging the duty of care imposed by s. 3(1) of the Act.  Where s. 4(1) applies, it does in fact
    dislodge the duty of care imposed by s. 3(1) and imposes on an occupier a
    lesser duty than the duty imposed in s. 3(1).  Based on the analysis that followed this statement, however, I take the
    trial judge to have meant that the appellant did not meet the lesser duty
    imposed by s.&nbsp;4(1) because it acted with reckless disregard of the
    presence of Ms. Schneider in the Park.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in his interpretation
    of s. 4(1) of the Act in two respects.  First, s. 4(1) provides that the lesser duty
    of care set out in s. 4(1) displaces the duty of care provided in s. 3(1) “in
    respect of risks willingly assumed by the person who enters on the
    premises.”  Where s. 4(3) and s. 4(4)
    apply, the person is “deemed” to have assumed the risks.  If, as found by the trial judge, the deeming
    sections do not apply, the court nonetheless must go on to determine, based on
    the evidence, whether the person has in fact willingly assumed the risks.  This was not addressed by the trial judge and
    he made no finding in that regard.  However, given my conclusion on the applicability of s. 4(4<span
class=GramE>)(</span>f), the failure to make the necessary finding is of no
    consequence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge based his conclusion that the
    appellant acted with reckless disregard on the fact that the appellant knew or
    ought to have known that the concrete wall “would likely be covered by a
    blanket of snow in the winter and thus either partially or entirely hidden from
    view” and that the Park, including the Lake, “was regularly used by skaters and
    cross-country skiers during the winter months”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    30.  Relying on <span class=SpellE><i>Onyschuk</i></span><i> v. Silver Harbour Acres Ltd.</i> (1984), 49 O.R. (2d) 762 (H.C.), the
    trial judge was of the view that the wall, hidden beneath snow, had become a
    “trap” and that the appellant “displayed a reckless disregard for the safety of
    the users of the park, in general and [Ms.] Schneider, in particular, in
    failing to provide some form of signage to mark the presence of the concrete
    wall”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the reasoning in <i>Whitney v. University College of the <span class=SpellE>Carriboo</span>,</i> 2004 BCSC 1110, <span class=GramE>the</span> trial judge concluded that “once a
    non-natural object, such as the concrete wall, was constructed and introduced
    into the park, the occupier had a duty to keep this object from interfering
    with the normal and promoted use of the park”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 32.
      He
    further reasoned that “to adequately fulfill its obligation under s. 3(1) of
    the Act, an occupier is expected to exercise care against dangers that were
    sufficiently and normally foreseeable: <span class=SpellE><i>Alchimowicz</i></span><i> v. <span
class=SpellE>Schram</span></i>, [1999] O.J. No. 115 at p. 3 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    and <i>Doyle v. Petrolia</i>, [2005] O.J.
    No. 1950 at p. 3 (Ont. C.A.)”: <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 33.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in his interpretation
    of the term “reckless disregard” as it is used in s. 4(1) of the Act.  The trial judge’s analysis of the appellant’s
    failure to meet its duty of care is relatively short and no separate analysis
    of the s. 3(1) and s. 4(1) duties was carried out.  His reference to s. 4(1) not dislodging the
    s. 3(1) duty of care and his reliance on the <i>Whitney</i>, <span class=SpellE><i>Alchimowicz</i></span> and <i>Doyle</i> decisions – all s. 3(1) cases
    – suggest that the trial judge may well have conflated the duties of care set
    out in s.&nbsp;3(1) and s. 4(1).<a href="#_ftn2"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As stated by this court in <i>Cormack v. Mara (Township) </i>(1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 716, at p. 724,
    acting with reckless disregard of the presence of a person means “doing or
    omitting to do something which he or she should recognize as likely to cause
    damage or injury to [the person] present on his or her premises, not caring
    whether such damage or injury results.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings that the appellant knew or
    ought to have known that the concrete wall would likely be covered in snow and
    thus be hidden from view and that the park was regularly used by cross-country
    skiers may well provide a sufficient basis for concluding a breach of the s.
    3(1) duty, however, they do not, in my view, provide a sufficient basis for
    concluding that the appellant acted “with reckless disregard” to the presence
    of users of the Park.  To reach the level
    of “reckless disregard”, more is required.  There is no suggestion in the record that the appellant had specific
    knowledge that the concrete wall, depending on the snow conditions, would be
    hidden from view of cross-country skiers and thus pose a risk of injury to a
    skier choosing to leave the trail.  The
    concrete wall had been in place for more than a decade, apparently without
    incident or suggestion that, in winter, it constituted a hazard or trap to
    users of the Park.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant knew that cross-country skiers
    used the Park – it in fact encouraged such use – this in no way constitutes
    proof that the appellant knew or ought to have known that cross-country skiers
    would occasionally travel off the marked trails to ski down the <span
class=SpellE>berm</span> to the Lake in the manner done by Ms. Schneider and
    that doing so could lead to injury.  In
    order to constitute recklessness, the court must find that the occupier knew or
    should have known that injury was likely.  That finding was not made in this case.  Further, there was no basis for making such a finding.  There simply was no evidence that the
    appellant knew or ought to have known that cross-country skiers were likely to
    collide with the partially snow covered wall in a manner such that a serious
    injury could or was likely to result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The situation in <span class=SpellE><i>Onyschuk</i></span> on which the trial judge
    relied is quite different.  In that case,
    the defendant placed a cable across a part of a roadway that the defendant knew
    was frequently used by snowmobilers.  The
    defendant also “knew the condition of [the] cable immediately prior to the
    accident, that it was approximately two feet from the ground at each end but it
    was covered by the snow in the center for at least two metres” and that it
    “must have been obvious to anyone that this very accident … was not only a
    distinct possibility, but a probability…”: p. 767.  In those circumstances, the trial judge
    properly concluded that the cable served no useful purpose and constituted a
    trap.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and set
    aside the trial judgment.  As a result, I
    would also dismiss the cross appeal and thus need not address the issues raised
    by the respondents in the cross appeal.  I would award costs on a partial indemnity basis to the appellant fixed
    at $18,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
