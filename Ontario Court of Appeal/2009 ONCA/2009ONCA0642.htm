  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the jurisdiction of an arbitrator
    to order security for costs and whether an application to set aside such an
    order lies to the Superior Court.  The
    respondent, Inforica Inc. (“Inforica”), commenced arbitral proceedings against
    the appellant, CGI Information Systems and Management Consultants Inc. (“CGI”),
    pursuant to an arbitration term in their agreement.  The arbitrator granted CGI’s motion for
    security for costs, ruling that he had jurisdiction to make such an order under
    the <i>ADR Chambers Rules </i>and under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17
    (the “Act”).  Inforica moved to set aside
    that order in the Superior Court.  The
    application judge allowed Inforica’s application on the ground that the
    arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to order security for costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CGI appeals that order to this court, arguing that the
    application judge erred in law in finding that she had jurisdiction to
    entertain Inforica’s application and, if she did have jurisdiction, that she
    erred in concluding that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to order security
    for costs.  Inforica moves to quash CGI’s
    appeal on the ground that pursuant to s. 17(9) of the Act, no appeal lies from
    an arbitral tribunal’s ruling “on its own jurisdiction to conduct the arbitration”,
    and that if an appeal lies pursuant to s. 49 of the Act, it is only by leave of
    this court and CGI has not sought leave.  CGI responds to the motion to quash, <i>inter alia</i>, with a motion for leave to
    appeal pursuant to s. 49 if leave is required. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CGI and Inforica entered a “Subcontractor Agreement” in
    July 2004 whereby Inforica agreed to provide certain specialized services in
    connection with an agreement for the development of an information management
    system undertaken by CGI for a third party.  The Subcontractor Agreement provided for the arbitration of all disputes
    under the Act.  In June 2007, Inforica
    asserted a claim under the Subcontractor Agreement by way of Notice of
    Arbitration for $14.4 million.  CGI
    counterclaimed for $9.3 million.  The
    parties entered an Arbitration Agreement on August 31, 2007, agreeing to a
    named arbitrator and a timetable for the conduct of the arbitration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2008, the arbitrator heard CGI’s motion for
    security for costs.  CGI submitted that
    Inforica was a corporation without the means to satisfy an order for costs.  Inforica is closely held by four principals,
    each of whom stood to gain significantly if Inforica’s claim succeeded and who
    did not dispute that they were in a position to provide security for costs.  As the arbitration had been undertaken on a
    contingency basis, it was being conducted without significant financial risk to
    Inforica or to the four principals, but at significant financial risk to CGI.  Inforica disputed the arbitrator’s jurisdiction
    to order security for costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator concluded that he had jurisdiction to
    order security for costs pursuant to the <i>ADR
    Chambers Rules</i>, and under the terms of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 8(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>h) of the <i>ADR Chambers Rules</i> provides that the
    arbitrator may “order any party to provide security for the legal or other
    costs of any other party by way of a deposit or bank guarantee or in any other
    manner the arbitrator(s) thinks fit”.  The arbitrator rejected Inforica’s position that the arbitration was not <span class=GramE>an ADR</span> Chambers arbitration.  Correspondence between <span class=GramE>counsel</span> to arrange the selection of the arbitrator referred to him as being “of ADR
    Chambers” and indicated that ADR Chambers had been contacted to determine the
    arbitrator’s availability.  ADR Chambers
    responded to that request with detailed information regarding the structure for
    the arbitration, the arbitrator’s availability, and the need for deposits to be
    paid to ADR Chambers.  The arbitration
    agreement itself referred to the payment of deposits to ADR Chambers and the
    deposits were paid by both parties.  ADR
    Chambers provided counsel with copies of the <i>ADR Chambers Rules</i>.  The
    arbitrator concluded on this evidence that the arbitration was being conducted
    as an ADR Chambers matter and that the <i>ADR
    Chambers Rules</i> accordingly applied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator also ruled that he had the authority to
    order security for costs pursuant to s. 20 of the Act, which provides that an
    arbitrator “may determine the procedure to be followed in the
    arbitration”.  The arbitrator ruled that
    as costs were a procedural matter, so too were orders made to ensure the
    ultimate payment of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator found that Inforica did not have the
    ability to satisfy an order for costs, and that an order for security for costs
    was justified from the perspective “of assuring the integrity of the arbitral
    process”.  He ruled that Inforica should
    be required to post $750,000 by way of an appropriate letter of credit as
    security for costs within 30 days, failing which CGI could move to have the
    arbitration dismissed.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>APPLICATION
    JUDGE’S RULING</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CGI argued that the application judge had no
    jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under the Act as the order for security
    for costs was a procedural matter from which no appeal lies.  The application judge did not deal with CGI’s
    submission as to her jurisdiction in her reasons, but added, in a handwritten
    endorsement accompanying the release of her reasons, that “as I have found that
    the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction in making the order, it must be set
    aside, whether under s. 46(1) of the Act, or otherwise”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that the arbitrator had no
    jurisdiction to order security for costs.  She concluded that an order for security for
    costs “may properly be placed in a specialized category of its own” and that
    such an order “is not merely a matter of procedure”.  Relying upon a line of authority starting with <i>Re Unione Stearinerie Lanza and Weiner</i>,
    [1917] 2 K.B. 558 (C.A.), she reasoned that as an order for security for costs
    “has nothing to do with the arbitrator ascertaining the true position between
    the parties in order to determine the case”, but rather puts “an obstacle in
    the way of proceeding” until the plaintiff has posted security. Such an order
    cannot be described as procedural in nature within the meaning of s. 20(1) of
    the Act.  The application judge also
    referred to several decisions, including <i>Toronto-Dominion
    Bank v. Szilagyi Farms Ltd</i>. (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 433 (C.A.), holding that
    there is no inherent jurisdiction to order security for costs. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i>Issue (1) <span class=GramE>Did</span> the application judge have jurisdiction to entertain the application to set
    aside the order for security for costs?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the structure and purpose of the Act
    in general, and from the wording of s. 6 in particular, that judicial
    intervention in the arbitral process is to be strictly limited to those
    situations contemplated by the Act.  This
    is in keeping with the modern approach that sees arbitration as an autonomous,
    self-contained, self-sufficient process pursuant to which the parties agree to
    have their disputes resolved by an arbitrator, not by the courts.  As Inforica states in its factum, “arbitral
    proceedings are presumptively immune from judicial review and oversight.”  The Act encourages parties to resort to
    arbitration, “require[s] them to hold to that course once they have agreed to
    do so”, and “entrenches the primacy of arbitration over judicial proceedings … by
    directing the court, generally, not to intervene”: <i>Ontario Hydro v. Denison Mines Ltd</i>., [1992] O.J. No. 2948 (Gen.
    Div.), <span class=GramE>Blair</span> J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inforica’s motion to set aside the arbitrator’s order
    for security for costs was brought under ss. 17(8), 46(1) and, in the
    alternative, for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 45(1) of the Act.  As I have noted, the application judge did
    not explicitly rule on CGI’s objection to her jurisdiction to entertain the
    application, but indicated by way of endorsement that she was granting the
    application  “whether under s. 46(1) of
    the Act, or otherwise”.  The application
    judge did not grant leave to appeal under s. 45(1).  Accordingly, I need only consider ss. 17(8)
    and 46(1) as possible sources for the application judge’s jurisdiction. </p>
  <h3><i>(<span
class=GramE>i</span>) Section 17(8)</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To establish the application judge’s jurisdiction to
    entertain Inforica’s application under ss. 17(5), (7) or (8) as an application
    to set aside the arbitrator’s ruling “as a preliminary question”, Inforica must
    bring the arbitrator’s ruling that he had jurisdiction to entertain the CGI’s application
    for security for costs within s. 17(1).  Section
    17(1) defines the parameters of s. 17, allowing an arbitrator to rule on his
    “own jurisdiction to conduct the arbitration”.  In my opinion, on a fair reading of that language in light of the modern
    approach that respects the autonomy of the arbitral process and discourages
    judicial intervention, s. 17(1) is concerned with only the arbitrator’s
    jurisdiction to entertain the subject matter of the dispute.  Asking an arbitrator to decide whether he has
    jurisdiction to order security for costs does not amount to asking him whether
    he has jurisdiction to conduct the arbitration.  The words “jurisdiction to conduct the arbitration” in s. 17(1) connote
    jurisdiction over the entire substance or subject matter of the case, not
    jurisdiction to make interlocutory or procedural orders that do not determine
    the merits of the dispute and that are made along the way to final resolution
    of the issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitration clause in the Subcontractor Agreement
    reinforces the point that by resorting to arbitration, the parties acknowledged
    that until there has been a final determination on the merits, there is to be
    no recourse to the courts.  The parties
    explicitly agreed to submit their disputes to arbitration and that: “Such
    dispute shall not be made the subject matter of an action in any court of law
    by any Party unless the dispute has been first submitted to arbitration <i>and finally determined by the arbitrator(s)</i>”
    (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A significant feature of the modern approach limiting
    access to the courts to review decisions of arbitrators is that there are no
    appeals from procedural or interlocutory orders.  In <i>Environmental
    Export International of Canada Inc. v. Success International Inc</i>., [1995]
    O.J. No. 453 (Gen. Div.), at para. 14, MacPherson J. held: “There is nothing in
    the <i>Arbitration Act</i> providing for
    appeals from, or applications to set aside, decisions of arbitrators on
    procedural points.  It would be wrong … for
    the courts to invent such a remedy and inject it into the arbitration process”.  This principle is reiterated in <i>Tescor Energy Services Inc. v. Toronto
    District School Board</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 74 (S.C.), at para. 30, where Lane
    J. held: “there is nothing in the Act to permit appeals from or the setting
    aside of decisions of arbitrators on procedural points”.  This is a deliberate policy, “not a lacuna in
    our law”, to protect the autonomy of the arbitral process.  The creation of a power by the courts to
    intervene on interlocutory rulings by arbitrators “would constitute a most
    serious reproach to the ability of our system of arbitration to serve the needs
    of users of the arbitral process”: <i>K/S
    A/S Biakh v. Hyundai Corp.</i>, [1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 187 (Q.B. Com. Ct.) at p.
    189, Steyn J..  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge accepted Inforica’s argument that
    an order for security for costs is not a procedural order and Inforica relies
    heavily on <i>Re Unione Stearinerie Lanza
    and Weiner</i>, <i>supra</i>, in support of
    that proposition.  In that case, the
    claimant challenged the arbitrator’s authority to make an order for security
    for costs under a general provision of the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1889 </i>(U.K.), 52 &amp; 53 Vict., c. 49 that required the parties,
    “subject to any legal objection” to “do all other things which during the
    proceedings … the arbitrators or umpire may require”.  The arbitrator doubted his authority to make
    an order for security for costs, but agreed to state a point of law for the
    court under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1889</i>,
    s. 19.  I pause to observe that the issue
    I am now considering, namely, whether the court had the jurisdiction to set
    aside an arbitrator’s order for security for costs, did not arise in that case.
     Section 19 of the 1889 Act provided an
    open-ended right of access “at any stage of the proceedings” on “any question
    of law”. This provision reflects a profoundly different approach to judicial
    intervention in the arbitral process than that prevailing in Ontario in 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The English Court of Appeal in <i>Re Unione Stearinerie Lanza and Weiner</i>, <i>supra</i>, held that the arbitrator’s general power to require the
    parties “to do all other things” that the arbitrator might require did not
    include the power to order security for costs.  Lord Reading C.J., at p. 562, considered it to
    be obvious that an arbitrator could not have all the powers of a judge and that
    the words of the 1889 Act had to be narrowly interpreted to limit the powers of
    the arbitrator to ordering the parties “to do all such things as he may require
    in order to assist him in arriving at a determination of the dispute”.  As the dispute could be resolved without an
    order for security for costs, the statutory power did not confer authority to
    order security for costs.  As “[t]he
    object of the application for security for costs is not to enable the
    proceedings to continue” towards resolution on the merits, but rather “to put
    an obstacle in the way” of the claimant proceeding until he has posted
    security, Lord Reading C.J. concluded, at p. 562, that the order “has nothing
    whatever to do with the arbitrator ascertaining the true position between the
    parties in order to determine the case”.  Likewise, Lord Reading C.J. rejected the
    argument the authority to order stay the arbitration at the outset for failure
    to post security for costs flowed from the power to award costs at the
    conclusion of the arbitration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inforica also relies on <i>Re <span class=SpellE>Ramot</span> Gil <span class=SpellE>Dev.Corp.Ltd</span>. <span class=GramE>and</span> Precision Homes Corp. Inc.</i> (1979), 27 O.R.
    (2d) 199 (Div. Ct.), a case arising under the <i>Arbitrations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 25.  Again, that case came to the court by way of
    stated case pursuant to s. 26 of the Act that required an arbitrator to state a
    case for determination by the Divisional Court on “any question of law arising
    in the course” of the arbitration.  Accordingly,
    there was no issue as to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain an
    application to challenge an arbitrator’s authority to order security for costs.
     Relying on <i>Re Unione Stearinerie Lanza and Weiner</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>the Divisional
    Court, held that an arbitrator lacked the inherent power to order security for
    costs and that the power could not be inferred from the general power to
    require the parties to submit to examination, produce documents, “and do all
    other things during the proceedings on the reference that the arbitrators …
    require”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither <i>Re Unione
    Stearinerie Lanza and Weiner</i> or <i>Re
    Ramot Gil Dev. Corp.Ltd. <span class=GramE>and</span> Precision Homes Corp. Inc</i>.
    are binding on this court.  Both cases
    rest on legislation reflecting an approach to judicial intervention on arbitral
    matters that is significantly at variance with the modern Act and the modern
    approach to the autonomy of the arbitral process.  They clearly do not stand for the proposition
    that a Superior Court judge has the jurisdiction to set aside an arbitrator’s
    order for security for costs under today’s very different statutory regime limiting
    recourse to the courts and respecting the autonomy of the arbitral process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have noted, the application judge did not deal
    with the issue of her jurisdiction to entertain the application in her reasons.
    It may perhaps be inferred that because she considered the order for security
    for costs to be not strictly procedural in nature, it was open to her to review
    it.  If that was her decision, I
    respectfully disagree.  The issue is not
    whether the order is, strictly speaking, procedural in nature – the issue is
    whether the order amounted to a ruling on the arbitrator’s “own jurisdiction to
    conduct the arbitration”.  In my view, it
    did not and s. 17(8) did not apply to confer jurisdiction on the application
    judge, even if the order for security for costs was not, strictly speaking, procedural
    in nature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add, however, that even if it can be said that
    orders for security for costs do fall into a special category, that category is
    much closer to procedure than to substance.  Such orders are made to protect the integrity of the dispute resolution
    process by preventing parties from structuring their affairs in a manner that
    immunizes them from the discipline of costs.  They do not decide rights, but rather serve to
    ensure that parties are governed by the rules of the game.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of analogy, for appeal purposes in ordinary
    civil proceedings, an order for security for costs is regarded as a procedural
    order from which there is no right of appeal.  Such an order is interlocutory in nature,
    incidental to the resolution of the subject matter of the dispute, and,
    accordingly, an appeal only lies to the Divisional Court with leave: see <i>Susin v. Chapman</i>, 1998 CanLII 3224 (ON
    C.A.); <i>Shuter v. Toronto</i>, <i>Dominion Bank</i>, 2007 CanLII 37475 (ON
    S.C.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that failure to satisfy an order for
    security for costs may lead to a dismissal of the claim, but the sanction for
    non-compliance with an order cannot alter the nature of the order itself.  Many procedural or interlocutory orders – for
    particulars, for production of documents, for the payment of costs ordered in
    interlocutory proceedings – may carry the ultimate sanction of dismissal of the
    non-complying party’s claim.  But if the
    claim is dismissed, the dismissal flows from the party’s failure to comply with
    the interlocutory or procedural order, not from the order itself, and does not
    alter the interlocutory or procedural nature of the order that led to
    dismissal: see <i>Laurentian Plaza Corp. v.
    Martin</i> (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 111 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept Inforica’s submission that finding the
    application judge’s order to have been made without jurisdiction violates the
    principle in administrative law, established in <i>Canadian</i>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Union</i><i> of Public Employees, <span class=GramE>Local
    963 v</span>. New Brunswick Liquor Corp</i>., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227, at p. 233,
    and repeated in <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 35, that courts should hesitate before branding
    administrative decisions as jurisdictional, thereby rendering them subject to
    curial review.  In my view, that
    injunction is more directly applicable to how we should interpret the reach of
    ss. 17(1) and (8).  It points towards a
    narrow construction of those provisions, limiting the scope for curial
    interference with the arbitral process, by limiting the reach of s. 17 to
    decisions as to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to entertain the subject matter
    of the dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude, therefore, that the arbitrator’s
    determination that he had the authority to order security for costs was not a
    ruling as to his “jurisdiction to conduct the arbitration” within the meaning
    of s. 17(1) and that therefore the application judge did not have jurisdiction
    to entertain the application to set aside the order pursuant to s. 17(8). </p>
  <h3><i>(ii)
    Section 46(1)</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the arbitrator’s order for security for
    costs was not an “award” within the meaning of s. 46(1).  The arbitrator aptly labelled his order as a
    “Procedural Order”and not as an “award”. The Act does not define the term
    “award”, but the term has been held to connote the judgment or order of an
    arbitral tribunal that “disposes of part or all of the dispute between the
    parties”:<i> Environmental Export
    International of Canada Inc. v. Success International Inc</i>.,<i> supr</i>a, at para. 13.  J. Kenneth McEwan &amp; Ludmila B. Herbst, <i>Commercial Arbitration in Canada</i>,
    (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2008) state at 9:30.10: “Only decisions
    determining the substantive issues should be termed ‘awards’.  Matters relating to the conduct of the
    arbitration are not awards but, rather, are procedural orders and directions”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude, accordingly, that the application judge did
    not have jurisdiction to entertain the application to set aside the order for
    security for costs pursuant to s. 46(1). </p>
  <h3><i>Issue (2) Does this court have
    jurisdiction to entertain CGI’s appeal? </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the application judge had no jurisdiction to
    entertain the application to set aside the order for security for costs, this
    court has jurisdiction pursuant to s. 6(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C-43 to entertain an appeal from her decision.  In <i>Huras
    v. Primerica Financial Services Ltd</i>. (2000), 137 O.A.C. 79, this Court dealt
    with s. 7(6), which provides that there “shall be no appeal” from a decision on
    a motion for a stay pursuant to s. 7(1).  Writing for the court, Finlayson J.A. held that if the motion court
    judge refuses to grant a stay on the ground that the matter was not subject to
    arbitration, s. 7(1) is not applicable and the prohibition against an appeal in
    s. 7(6) is equally not applicable.  As
    the appeal is not barred by s. 7, it lies to this court pursuant to s. 6(1)(b)
    of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> if it is
    final order: see also <i>Brown v. Murphy</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 404 (C.A.), at paras. 1-8, Charron J.A.; <i>Smith Estate v. National Money Mart</i> (2008),
    92 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at para. 29. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the same reasoning applies to s. 17(9). If
    the application judge did not have jurisdiction to entertain the application
    under s. 17 in the first place, s. 17(9) does not bar an appeal from her decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge’s order must be
    regarded as a final order for the purposes of s. 6(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).
     The application to set aside the
    arbitrator’s order was an originating proceeding.  It was the only matter before the court.  The application judge’s order finally disposed
    of the originating proceeding. It must, therefore, be regarded as a final order
    for the purposes of appeal, even though it did not finally resolve the matters
    in dispute in the other forum, namely the arbitration: <i>Buck Bros. Ltd. v. Frontenac Builders Ltd.</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 97
    (C.A.), Morden J.A. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I conclude that this court does have
    jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the application judge’s order.</p>
  <h3><i>Issue (3) If she had jurisdiction to
    entertain the application, and if this court has jurisdiction to entertain the
    appeal from her decision, did the application judge err in setting aside the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have concluded that the application judge did not
    have jurisdiction to entertain the application, and that the appeal should be
    allowed on that basis, it is not necessary for me to consider this issue.  I will not deal with the issue of whether s.
    20 of the Act conferred jurisdiction on the arbitrator to order security for costs
    but, as the matter was fully argued and for the sake of completeness, I will
    offer the following observations on the arbitrator’s ruling as to the

    Earthmovers v. Edmonton (City)</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 116, adopting the test set
    out in <i>Canadian Pacific Hotels Ltd. v.
    Bank of Montreal</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 711.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not see this as a case of the arbitrator
    “implying” a term into the contract.  Rather,
    the arbitrator found that through their actions and correspondence, the parties
    had in fact agreed to conduct the arbitration through ADR Chambers with an ADR
    Chambers arbitrator and they had thereby agreed to be bound by the terms set by
    ADR Chambers for arbitrations conducted under its umbrella.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for both parties made explicit reference to ADR
    Chambers in their correspondence when setting up the arbitration.  Counsel for CGI explained that they were
    “investigating the possibility of securing Mr. Thomas I.A. Allen, Q.C., of ADR
    Chambers as arbitrator” and that they had contacted ADR Chambers to enquire as
    to his availability.  Counsel for
    Inforica later inquired whether they had “heard from ADR Chambers with respect
    to” the arbitrator’s availability.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ADR Chambers then wrote to both <span class=GramE>counsel</span> providing information regarding the structure for the arbitration, the
    arbitrator’s availability, his rate, a release in his favour and in favour of
    ADR Chambers, and the need for deposits to be paid to ADR Chambers.  The letter enclosed detailed information
    regarding ADR Chambers including the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>ARBITRATION
    RULES AND ARBITRATION AGEEMENTS: </b>The arbitration rules of ADR Chambers and
    any amendments thereto shall be deemed to have been made a part of any
    Arbitration Agreement which provides for arbitration by ADR Chambers and any
    arbitration which takes place with ADR Chambers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties paid deposits to ADR Chambers and the
    Arbitration Agreement itself referred to ADR Chambers.  The parties subsequently met with the
    arbitrator at ADR Chambers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was clearly open to the arbitrator to
    conclude on this record that the arbitration was “tak[ing] place with ADR
    Chambers” and it was, therefore, subject to the <i>ADR Chambers Rules</i>.  The
    arbitrator was well placed to determine this issue.  He was familiar with the steps taken to set up
    the arbitration and he was familiar with the workings of ADR Chambers.  There was a strong evidentiary basis to
    support his finding that the ADR Chambers Rules applied.  This was either a finding of fact or a finding
    close to the fact end of the mixed fact and law spectrum with which a court
    should be reluctant to interfere.  I find
    Inforica’s submission that the application judge properly rejected it to be
    entirely unpersuasive.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss Inforica’s motion to quash
    the appeal, allow the appeal, and restore the arbitrator’s order for security
    for costs. CGI is entitled to its costs in the amounts agreed to by the
    parties, namely, $15,000 for the appeal and $25,000 for the motion in the
    superior court. </p>
