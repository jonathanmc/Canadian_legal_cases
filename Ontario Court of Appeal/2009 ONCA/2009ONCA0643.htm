  <h3>1.         The Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the early evening of
    December 6, 2006, Mr. Winlow was driving north on Highway 400.  The posted speed limit on the highway is 100
    km per hour.  A police officer stopped
    Mr. Winlow and charged him with speeding, contrary to s. 128 of the <i>HTA</i>.  On the offence notice given to Mr. Winlow, the officer noted the speed
    at 115 km per hour in a 100 km per hour zone.  The offence notice provided that Mr. Winlow could dispose of the charge
    by paying a set fine of $37.50 plus $5.00 for costs and a $10 victim fine
    surcharge – a total of $52.50.  Mr.
    Winlow chose not to pay the fine; instead he asked for a trial.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>2.         The Trial <span class=GramE>Before</span> the Justice of the Peace</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial took place on August
    16, 2007 before Justice of the Peace <span class=SpellE>Hodson</span>-Walker.  Mr. Winlow represented himself.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before the trial began, the
    prosecutor told Mr. Winlow that the police officer would likely testify Mr.
    Winlow was driving faster than 115 km per hour.  The prosecutor also told Mr. Winlow that if that was the officer’s
    evidence, the prosecutor would ask the court to amend the charge to conform to
    the higher rate of speed.  Because a
    conviction at a higher rate of speed would mean a higher fine and, perhaps,
    other serious consequences, the prosecutor offered Mr. Winlow an adjournment to
    speak to a <span class=SpellE>counsel or</span> an agent.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Winlow refused an
    adjournment.  He said that he wanted the
    trial to go ahead.  Before the justice of
    the peace, the prosecutor asked Mr. Winlow if he was aware of the possibility
    that the charge could go up, to which he responded “I am”.  Mr. Winlow was arraigned on the certificate
    of offence – he was charged with the offence of speeding, 115 km per hour in a
    100 km per hour zone.  He pleaded not
    guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The officer who had stopped Mr.
    Winlow on Highway 400 testified for the prosecution.  He gave evidence that he followed Mr. Winlow
    and “paced” him.  The officer was driving
    at a speed of 130 km per hour, and yet Mr. Winlow was pulling away from
    him.  The officer used his discretion to
    write the offence notice at 115 km per hour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the officer’s
    examination-in-chief, the prosecutor asked to amend the certificate of offence
    under s. 34(2) of the <i>POA</i> to conform <span
class=GramE>with</span> the evidence that Mr. Winlow was driving at 130 km per
    hour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The justice of the peace
    refused to permit the amendment.  She
    gave two reasons: if the certificate was amended, Mr. Winlow who “was not
    expecting this turn of events might feel coerced in pleading guilty”; and “the
    motion to amend is not compatible with the philosophy” of the Act – which “is
    to deal with matters in a quick, efficient and fair manner”.  Significantly, in refusing the amendment, the
    justice of the peace did not make a finding that Mr. Winlow was driving at 130
    km per hour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial continued.  Mr. Winlow cross-examined the officer.  He then testified.  He said that he did not believe he was going
    any faster than the other traffic on the highway.  But he acknowledged that he did not look at
    his speedometer, and did not know at what rate of speed he was driving.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the conclusion of the trial
    the justice of the peace gave brief oral reasons.  She rejected Mr. <span class=SpellE>Winlow’s</span> evidence.  She convicted him of speeding,
    115 km per hour in a 100 km zone.  She
    imposed a total fine of $60 - $45, the “statutory requirement” for that rate of
    speed, plus $5 in court costs and a $10 surcharge.  </span></p>
  <h3>3.         The Appeal in the Ontario
    Court of Justice</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Regional Municipality of
    York appealed to the Ontario Court of Justice.  Mr. Winlow again represented himself.  The Regional Municipality contended that the justice of the peace erred
    in law by refusing to amend the certificate of offence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justice <span class=SpellE>Minard</span>,
    the appeal court judge, dismissed the appeal.  He said that the proposed amendment did not prejudice Mr. Winlow.  He also acknowledged that had he been
    exercising his discretion at the trial, he would have granted the
    amendment.  But he could not say that the
    justice of the peace had erred in law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Regional Municipality
    sought leave to appeal under s. 131 of the <i>POA</i>,
    which prescribes that leave may be granted on a question of law alone where it
    is essential in the public interest or for the due administration of justice
    that leave be granted.  On April 18, 2008,

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>First Issue: Is the
    particular rate of speed an essential element of the offence of speeding?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There appears to be a small
    debate among the justices of the peace and the Ontario Court of Justice judges
    over whether the particular rate of speed at which a defendant is charged with
    driving is an essential element of the offence of speeding or a particular
    relevant only to penalty.  In the vast
    majority of cases, justices of the peace and Ontario Court of Justice judges
    have concluded that the offence is speeding contrary to s. 128(1) of the <i>HTA</i>, and that the actual rate of speed matters
    only on penalty.  A few cases, however – see,
    for example, <i>R. v. Ali</i>, [1993] O.J.
    No. 4675 (Ct. J.) – suggest that the particular rate of speed is an essential
    element of the offence and thus, if the certificate is amended, the defendant
    is facing a different offence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the majority.  The offence provision for speeding is s.
    128(1) of the <i>HTA</i>: “no person shall
    drive a motor vehicle at a rate of speed greater than” the statutorily
    prescribed rate.  The actual rate of
    speed is a particular relevant to penalty under s. 128(14) of the <i>HTA</i>, because the amount of the fine
    increases as the rate of speed over the speed limit increases.  Thus, to obtain a higher fine in a case such
    as the present one, the prosecutor must seek an amendment, and the court must
    make a finding of fact on the actual rate of speed.  That fact must be proved beyond a reasonable
    doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the context of the court’s
    amendment power, this debate has little significance.  Even if an amendment to conform to the
    evidence disclosed at trial would mean that the defendant was facing a new
    offence, the court would still have the power to grant the amendment under s.
    34(2) of the <i>POA</i> so long as it was
    supported by the evidence, and would not cause prejudice or an injustice to the
    defendant: see <i>R. v. Irwin</i> (1998), 38
    O.R. (3d) 689 (C.A.).<a href="#_ftn1"

    caused a much larger debate among justices of the peace and Ontario Court of
    Justice judges.  This debate raises an
    important and difficult question.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>Second Issue: Depending on
    the rate of speed, is the fine for speeding fixed or does the court have
    discretion to reduce the fine?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    128(14) of the <i>HTA</i>, which sets out
    the fines for speeding:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(14) </span>Every person who contravenes this section or any by-law or regulation
    made under this section is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable,
    where the rate of speed at which the motor vehicle was driven,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=GramE>a</span>)       is less than 20 kilometres per hour over
    the speed limit, to a fine of $3 for each kilometre per hour that the motor
    vehicle was driven over the speed limit;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       <span
class=GramE>is</span> 20 kilometres per hour or more but less than 30
    kilometres per hour over the speed limit, to a fine of $4.50 for each kilometre
    that the motor vehicle was driven over the speed limit;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       is
    30 kilometres per hour or more but less than 50 kilometres per hour over the
    speed limit, to a fine of $7 for each kilometre that the motor vehicle was
    driven over the speed limit; and </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)       <span

    fine of $9.75 for each kilometre per hour that the motor vehicle was driven
    over the speed limit.</p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Winlow was found to have
    been driving at 115 km per hour in a 100 km per hour zone and was therefore fined
    under s. 128(14)(a).  Was the justice of
    the peace required to impose a fine of $45 ($3 X 15) or did she have discretion
    to reduce the fine?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The justice of the peace
    imposed a fine of $45 (plus costs and a surcharge).  She did not suggest that she had <span
class=GramE>a discretion</span> to do otherwise.  The majority of justices of the peace and
    judges who have considered this issue agree that she did not have discretion to
    reduce the fine: see for example, <i>R. v.
    Weber</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 126 (Ct. J.), <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 654 (Ct. J.), and <i>R. v. Chu</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 380 (Ct.
    J.).  They view s. 128(14) as a
    legislated exception to the usual principle that judges have discretion when
    sentencing an offender.  In their view,
    s. 128(14) admits of no discretion.  The
    amount of the fine is mandatory, and is derived from a simple mathematical
    calculation: the number of kilometres over the speed limit multiplied by the
    appropriate dollar figure.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Some justices of the peace and
    judges, however, have taken a contrary position: see for example, <i>R. v. Kuntz</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 4631 (Ct.
    J.).  In their view, s. 128(14) of the <i>HTA</i> does not clearly remove the usual
    discretion given to sentencing judges.  Any ambiguity in the interpretation of s. 128(14) must be resolved in
    favour of the offender.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justices of the peace and
    provincial court judges belong to tribunals created by statute.  Therefore, their jurisdiction to impose a
    penalty is limited by their authorizing legislation.  Neither has any inherent power.  The governing principle, now well
    established, is that justices of the peace and provincial court judges, have
    only the powers expressly or impliedly granted to them by the legislature: see <i>R. v. 974649</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575 at
    589.  See also s. 17(1) of the <i>Justices of the Peace Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990
    c. J. 4.  A corollary of this principle
    is that although sentencing judges ordinarily have a discretion to exercise,
    the legislature can limit that discretion or eliminate it altogether: see <i>R. v. Wu</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 530.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Does s. 128(14) of the <i>HTA</i> eliminate the court’s discretion to
    impose a lesser fine than the fine derived from multiplying the number of
    kilometres per hour over the speed limit by the specified dollar figure?  The answer to this question turns on the
    meaning of the words “is liable … to” in s. 128(14), words that my former
    colleague Robins J.A. aptly noted are not always free of ambiguity: see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Dilorenzo</span></i> (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 385 at p. 396.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On one hand, some argue that
    these words connote a mandatory obligation.  If the legislature had intended to give the sentencing judge <span
class=GramE>a discretion</span> to impose a lesser fine it would have used
    words such as “is liable … to a fine of <u>up to</u> $3 for each <span
class=SpellE>kilometre</span> per hour that the motor vehicle was driven over
    the speed limit”, or “is liable … to a fine of <u>not more than</u> $3”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, some contend
    that the words “is liable … to” mean “exposed to”, but give the court
    discretion to impose a smaller fine.  If
    the legislature had intended to remove the sentencing judge’s discretion it
    would have used words such as “is liable … to a fine <u>equal to</u> $3 for
    each kilometre per hour that the motor vehicle was driven over the speed
    limit”, or simply declared that “the fine <u>shall be</u> $3”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The cases on the meaning of “is
    liable … to” mirror this debate.  They
    too are conflicting.  For example, in <i>Canada (Minister of National Revenue –
    M.N.R.) v. <span class=SpellE>Panko</span></i>, [1972]  S.C.R. 319, Judson J. held that a penalty for
    tax evasion under the <i>Income Tax Act </i>–
    providing that the tax <span class=SpellE>payor</span> is “liable to a penalty
    of 25 per cent of the amount by which the tax that would so have been payable
    is less than the tax payable by him for the year” – gave the Minister no
    discretion about the amount or the penalty: it was fixed at a flat 25 per cent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, in the <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1923), 1 D.L.R.  820, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court had to
    decide whether a section of the <i>Income
    War Tax Act</i> providing that a person failing to file a tax return “shall be
    liable on summary conviction to a penalty of $25 for each day during which the
    default continues” gave the magistrate discretion to impose a lesser fine.  The majority held that the provision
    established a penalty in the fixed sum of $25 per day.  In the words of Rogers J. at p. 825, “… the
    magistrate can no more reduce it than he can increase it.  The words used, ‘shall be liable … to …’
    convey to my mind only one meaning.  They
    mean what they say; no more no less”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a case decided a year later, <i>R. v. Harrison and O’Kelly</i>, [1924] 3
    D.L.R. 312, <span class=SpellE>Trueman</span> J.A., writing for a unanimous
    five-member panel of the Manitoba Court of Appeal also concluded that this
    provision in the <i>Income War Tax Act</i> gave the magistrate no discretion to reduce the fine.  In his view at p. 313, the “mandatory nature”
    of the words “be liable …” are “beyond question”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By contrast, in <i>R. v. Robinson</i>, [1951] S.C.R. 522,
    Cartwright J., concurring, held that the meaning of the phrase “liable to” in a
    section of the <i>Criminal Code</i> stating
    that a person could not be found to be a “habitual criminal” unless three times
    previously “convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at
    least five years’ imprisonment” meant “exposed to”.  And, in <i>R.
    v. Fraser</i> (1944), 81 C.C.C. 114 (P.E.I. S.C.), Campbell C.J. held at p. 126
    that a penalty provision of the federal<i> Fisheries Act</i> making a person “liable … to a fine of one hundred dollars”
    gave the court discretion to impose “any fine not exceeding the maximum level
    of $100”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The exercise of determining the
    meaning of these words is an exercise in statutory interpretation.  Two key elements that guide a court’s
    interpretation of the words of a statute are context and legislative
    purpose.  These two elements underlie <span
class=SpellE>Driedger’s</span> cardinal principle of statutory interpretation,
    repeatedly endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one principle or <span
class=GramE>approach,</span> namely, the words of an Act are to be read in
    their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously
    with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of
    Parliament.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>See, for example, <i>Bell <span class=SpellE>ExpressVu</span> Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. <span class=GramE>26, quoting E.A. <span

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The apparently conflicting
    results in the cases I have summarized may simply reflect the different contexts
    and legislative purposes of the statutes in which these words appear.  Although some have argued that the meaning of
    “is liable … to” in s. 128(14) is ambiguous, the mere existence of different
    results does not create ambiguity.  As <span
class=SpellE>Iacobucci</span> J. said in <i>Bell <span class=SpellE>ExpressVu</span></i> at para. 30, “[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]t
    is necessary, in every case, for the court charged with interpreting a
    provision to undertake the contextual and purposive approach set out by <span
class=SpellE>Driedger</span>” to determine whether real ambiguity exists – that
    is, whether the provision is reasonably capable of more than one meaning.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having undertaken this
    exercise, I have concluded that the meaning of the words “is liable … to” in s.
    128(14) of the <i>HTA</i> is not
    ambiguous.  Especially in the light of
    their context and the legislative purpose of s. 128(14), in my view, they admit
    of only one meaning: they establish a statutory penalty regime that obliges
    courts to impose the fines specified in the section.  Courts have no discretion to reduce these
    fines.  Several considerations support
    this conclusion.</span></p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(<span
class=SpellE>i</span>)        Immediate
    context</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The dictionary meaning of
    “liable” is “bound or obliged by law of equity, answerable at law … bound in
    law to do”: see the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary Vol. 1 (Clarendon Press:
    Oxford, 1993).  The dictionary meaning of
    a word is not always the same as <span class=SpellE>Driedger’s</span> “ordinary
    sense” of the word because words take their <span class=SpellE>colour</span> from their surroundings: see <span class=SpellE>Iacobucci</span> J. in <i>Bell <span class=SpellE>ExpressVu</span></i> at para. 27, quoting Professor John Willis, “Statute Interpretation in a
    Nutshell” (1938), 16 Can. <span class=GramE>Bar</span> Rev. 1.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, here the immediate
    context in which the phrase “is liable … to” occurs, s. 128(14) of the Act
    itself, strongly suggests that these words are meant to bind or oblige courts
    to impose the specified fines.  Why else,
    I ask rhetorically, have a precise scale of fines where the dollar amount of
    the fine increases for every <span class=SpellE>kilometre</span> per hour over
    the speed limit by a specified amount depending on whether the rate of speed
    over the limit falls under ss. (a), (b), (c) or (d)?  </span></p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)       Broader
    context</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The broader legislative context
    of the other penalty provisions of the <i>HTA</i> further supports this conclusion.  The Act
    is replete with specific fines for specific offences.  Two things may be said about these fine
    provisions.  First, the legislature
    consistently has used the words “is liable … to” in setting out the fine that the
    court may impose.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, where the legislature
    intends to give courts discretion on the amount of the fine, it uses the words
    “not more than” and “not less than”.  Typical are the fine provisions where the legislature prescribes a
    minimum and a maximum fine, and gives the court discretion to impose an amount
    in between these limits.  The fine under
    s. 8(2) for driving contrary to restrictions on one’s permit is
    illustrative.  On conviction, the
    offender is liable to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500.  Similarly, on a conviction under s. 12 for
    defacing or altering a <span class=SpellE>licence</span> plate, an offender is
    liable to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000.  Other analogous penalty provisions of the act
    include s. 9(1), s. 23(4) and (5), s. 32(16), s. 51, s. 53, s. 79(5), s. 99, s.
    105(3), s. 124(6) and s. 172(2).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps more significant for
    this appeal, when the legislature prescribes only a maximum fine but intends to
    give the court discretion to impose a reduced fine below a stipulated maximum,
    it uses the words “not more than”.  The
    fine under s. 70(4) of the <i>HTA</i> for
    driving without tires that conform to prescribed specifications is an
    example.  On conviction, the offender is
    liable to a fine of not more than $1,000.  Other analogous provisions include s. 77(2), s. 82(9) and s. 187(4).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From this consistent statutory
    scheme, I infer that if the legislature had intended to give courts discretion
    to reduce the specified fines for speeding it would have used words such as “… is
    liable … to a fine of not more than $3 for every <span class=SpellE>kilometre</span> per hour that the motor vehicle was driven over the speed limit …”.  That the legislature did not do so powerfully
    supports the conclusion that the courts have no discretion to reduce the fines
    for speeding.</span></p>

    for speeding also support this conclusion.  The legislative regime that now exists came into effect in 1969.  Before that date the legislature specified a
    minimum and a maximum fine and gave courts discretion to impose a fine within
    those two limits.  Section 59(12) of the
    1960 <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> provided:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>59(12) Every person who contravenes any of the
    provisions of this section or any by-law passed or regulation made under this
    section is liable, for the first offence to a fine of not less than $5 and not
    more than $50; for the second offence to a fine of not less than $10 and not
    more than $100, and in addition his licence or permit may be suspended for a
    period of not more than three months; and for any subsequent offence to a fine
    of not less than $20 and not more than $200, and in addition his licence or
    permit may be suspended for a period of not more than six months.</p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 1969, s. 59(12) was repealed
    and replaced by the scheme now in place today – a sliding scale of fines

    45.  </span></p>

    the previous statutory provision, signals the legislature’s intent to remove
    the court’s discretion.  So too does the
    speech of the Minister of Transport introducing this new scheme.  Ministerial comments in <span class=SpellE>Hansard</span>,
    although of limited weight, if reliable, are still relevant to an understanding
    of the background and purpose of the legislation: see <i>Re Canada 3000 Inc.</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865 at para. 57.  I take the Minister’s speech in introducing
    the amending provision for fines for speeding to be both reliable and
    relevant.  He told the legislature that
    this new penalty section for speeding was designed to “establish a more
    meaningful deterrent … a uniform practice”: see Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <i>Official Reports of Debates</i> <i>(<span class=SpellE>Hansard</span>)</i>,
    28th Leg. 2nd sess. (31 March 1969) at p. 2866.   By the idea of a uniform practice
    the Minister undoubtedly meant a reversal of the previous discretionary
    regime.  </span></p>

  <h3>Third Issue: Is the practice of “amending up” permissible?</h3>
  <h3>1.         Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We were told by counsel that “amending
    up” of speeding charges is a common practice among Ontario’s
    municipalities.  The appellant, the
    Regional Municipality of York, is one of the municipalities that <span
class=GramE>engages</span> in this practice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The facts of this case
    illustrate the typical use of this practice: a police officer clocks a person driving
    at 30 km per hour over the speed limit but uses discretion to write the ticket
    for 15 km per hour over the speed limit.  If the driver pays the set fine on the offence notice, that amounts to a
    plea of guilty and a conviction, and disposes of the charge.  A driver who does not pay the set fine, but
    instead goes to trial, risks a conviction for speeding at 130 km per hour.  The prosecutor invariably will ask the court
    to “amend up” the certificate of offence from 115 km per hour to 130 km per
    hour to conform to the evidence given at trial.  Even if the prosecutor does not seek an amendment, the court can order
    the amendment itself after hearing the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Some have expressed concern
    about the propriety of this practice.  Likely it was this concern that prompted the Chief Justice of Ontario to
    grant leave to appeal to this court.  In
    oral argument, the Regional Municipality of York said that it is less
    interested in the result of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Winlow’s</span> case than in
    obtaining guidance from this court on the practice. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As a general conclusion, I see
    nothing inherently unfair about the practice itself.  It seems to me that it seeks to achieve, or
    at least balance, two laudable objectives, both of which are in the public
    interest: to provide offending drivers with an incentive to settle out of
    court, thus disposing of many speeding charges quickly and efficiently; and to
    ensure that drivers who commit speeding offences are convicted at the actual
    rate of speed over the speed limit that they drive, thus promoting both
    specific and general deterrence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first objective is
    triggered when a police officer exercises discretion to charge at a reduced
    rate of speed over the limit.  The second
    objective is triggered when the prosecutor asks for an amendment of the charge to
    conform to the evidence disclosed at trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Each case, however, turns on
    its own facts.  Drivers – many of whom
    represent <span class=GramE>themselves</span> in court – are protected by the four
    requirements of s. 34(4) of the <i>POA</i>.  A speeding charge may be “amended up” only if
    the evidence at trial supports the amendment, the circumstances of the case
    warrant the amendment, the defendant is not prejudiced by the amendment and no
    injustice would be visited on the defendant by granting the amendment.  Although, under s. 34(5) of the <i>POA</i>, the granting or refusal of <span
class=GramE>an</span> amendment is a question of law, the four requirements of
    s. 34(4) call for a fact-specific inquiry to be addressed by the court in each
    case.  </span></p>
  <h3>2.         Discussion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not consider it
    inappropriate when a police officer uses discretion to charge a driver with
    speeding at a rate less than the actual rate over the speed limit.  In a sense it is a form of plea
    bargaining.  Normally, the prosecutor
    engages in plea bargaining with the <span class=SpellE>defence</span>.  If a police officer charged a person with
    speeding 30 km per hour over the speed limit, and the prosecutor said that the
    charge would be reduced by 15 km if the person pleaded guilty, no one could
    seriously object.  Plea bargaining by the
    prosecution and the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> is as essential to the
    effective working of the provincial regulatory system as it is to the effective
    working of the criminal justice system.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the police
    officer, not the prosecutor, initiated the plea bargaining.  Many offending drivers no doubt welcome
    receiving this “break” from the officer, without having to go to court to
    obtain it.  Systemically, many cases can
    be disposed of without using valuable court time and resources.  Indeed, I expect that the large number of
    speeding charges, the heavy volume of traffic cases before justices of the
    peace, and the desirability of finding an efficient way to deal with many of
    these cases has prompted the practice now before this court.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, when drivers, as is
    their right, decide not to plead guilty and pay the set fine, but to instead defend
    the charge <span class=GramE>at a trial, different considerations</span> come
    into play.  The prosecutor then has
    carriage of the charge against the defendant.  The prosecutor’s carriage of the charge includes the discretion to
    manage the prosecution in accordance with the statute.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And, under s. 34(2) of the <i>POA</i>, the legislature has expressly
    authorized the court to amend a charge to conform to the evidence disclosed at
    trial.  Defendants have no vested right
    to insist on a trial only on the charge named on the certificate of
    offence.  The prosecutor may thus exercise
    discretion by asking the court to “amend up” the certificate.  The legislation gives the prosecutor the
    right to do so: see <i>R. v. Irwin</i>.  It is not for the courts to interfere with
    the exercise of prosecutorial discretion except in cases of flagrant
    impropriety: see <i>Krieger v. The Law
    Society of Alberta</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, before the amendment
    is granted, the court must consider the four requirements of s. 34(4) – the
    word “shall” makes the court’s consideration mandatory.  These requirements are intended to ensure
    that the court’s amendment power, although broad, is not exercised in a way
    that is unfair to defendants.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>34(4)  <span

    is not a legal entity for the purpose of proceedings under the <i>POA</i>, without the amendment the charge
    could not proceed.  See also <i>Ottawa (City) v. <span class=SpellE>Seenanan</span></i> (2004), 47 M.P.L.R. (3d) 4 (Ont. C.A.) at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.

    not mean the prospect of facing more severe consequences because of the
    amendment.  That a defendant may face a
    stiffer fine, more demerit points or increased insurance premiums is not a
    reason to refuse to amend the certificate to allege a higher rate a speed over
    the limit.  To decide whether a defendant
    is misled or prejudiced under s. 34(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>c), the court must
    consider whether the defendant’s opportunity and ability to meet the charge would
    be adversely affected by the amendment.  The court must ask: will “amending up” mislead or prejudice the

    defendants who appear in traffic court are self-represented; many have little
    or no knowledge of the justice system; many are poorly educated or have but a
    rudimentary knowledge of English.  As
    McKinnon A.C.J.O.  said nearly 30 years
    ago, in words still true today, “the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i> is not intended as a trap for the unskilled or unwary”: see <i>R. v. Jamieson</i> (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d)

    that the notice be given before the trial begins and that the defendant then be

    up, an adjournment should always be granted if the defendant wants one.  Some cases could no doubt go ahead even if
    the defendant objects.  However,
    prosecutors and the court must take care not to pressure defendants into
    proceeding, but instead give them a fair opportunity to state their
    position.  Despite a prosecutor’s or the
    court’s urge to proceed, an adjournment, if asked for or desired, may be the

    with charges quickly, efficiently and inexpensively.  He may well be right.  However, as I have already said, the practice
    is not inherently unfair or impermissible.  Municipalities and their prosecutors will have to decide whether this
    practice makes for the most efficient use of resources available for <i>POA</i> proceedings.</span></p>

    trial begins, the broad amendment power in s. 34(2) of the <i>POA</i> does contemplate that notice of the amendment can be made
    during or even at the conclusion of the evidence.  Still, the later during the proceedings that
    the defendant is given notice of the proposed amendment, the greater the risk
    of prejudice if the amendment is granted: see <i>R. v. Wanamaker</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1581 (Ct. J.).  Where notice to amend up is first given
    during the trial, defendants may well argue that they would have conducted
    their <span class=SpellE>defence</span> differently or even retained an agent
    had they known that they faced more serious consequences.  In the face of these or other arguments,
    before granting an amendment, the court must consider whether prejudice will
    result and whether any resulting prejudice can realistically be cured.  </span></p>

    can amend up a certificate of offence: see, for example, <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Morozuk</span></i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 31.  I would not encourage justices of the peace
    to do so; certainly, they should be cautious before doing so.  And, before deciding to exercise the
    amendment power on their own initiative, justices of the peace must give every
    defendant a fair opportunity to address the question of prejudice and make
    submissions why the amendment should be refused: see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rahil</span></i> (2005), 21 M.V.R. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    262 (Ont. Ct. J.).  Again, before
    exercising this power, justices of the peace must consider whether the

    or prejudice can be cured.</span></p>

  <h4><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is no doubt apparent from my
    discussion of the issues on this appeal that I do not fully subscribe either to
    the reasons of the justice of the peace or to the reasons of the appeal court
    judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On this record, we have no
    evidence that the police officer misled Mr. Winlow or gave any undertaking that
    the Regional Municipality would not seek a conviction for a higher speed.  We have no evidence that Mr. Winlow was
    prejudiced or coerced by the prosecutor’s proposed amendment.  We have no evidence that he was pressured
    into proceeding.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Indeed, before the trial began,
    Mr. Winlow was given the opportunity to adjourn the trial to seek the advice of
    a <span class=SpellE>counsel or</span> agent.  He understood his jeopardy if the amendment were granted.  Yet he chose to refuse the adjournment and
    proceed on the scheduled trial date.  He
    did not say that he was pressured to do so.  He did not claim that the proposed amendment had the effect of coercing
    him to plead guilty.  He did not claim
    that he would be prejudiced in the conduct of his <span class=SpellE>defence</span> if the amendment were allowed.  Nor did he
    claim that he would have to conduct his <span class=SpellE>defence</span> differently because of the proposed amendment.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, despite my
    reservations about the judgments of the justice of the peace and the appeal
    court judge, I would dismiss the Regional Municipality’s appeal.  I would do so for two reasons.  First, counsel for the Regional Municipality
    candidly acknowledged that his client was not interested in obtaining a greater
    fine for Mr. Winlow.  His client simply
    wanted some guidance from this court on the important issues raised by this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, having ruled that she
    would not grant the amendment, the Justice of the Peace did not make a finding
    that Mr. Winlow was driving at a speed of 130 km per hour.  Equally, the Appeal Court Judge made no
    finding that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Winlow’s</span> rate of speed was 130 km
    per hour.  I do not consider it
    appropriate in this case for this court to make a finding that was not made
    either in the trial court or the first level appeal court.  Thus, the amendment lacks an evidentiary
    basis.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would
    dismiss the Regional Municipality of York’s appeal.</span></p>
