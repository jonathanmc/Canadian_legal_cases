    C.43, the Divisional Court granted the appellants leave to appeal the motion

    issue in these appeals is whether the administration fee charged by the
    appellants to subscribers who are delinquent in the payment of their accounts
    is “interest” for the purposes of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. This determination turns on the interpretation and
    application of s. 347, which defines interest as “charges…paid or payable for
    the advancing of credit under an agreement or arrangement”. It is an offence
    under s. 347 to receive, or to enter into an agreement or arrangement to
    receive, interest at a rate exceeding 60 per cent per year. </span></p>

    .  The service agreements they enter into with
    their subscribers (“Subscriber Agreements”) call for monthly billing and the average
    account charge is approximately $50.00 per month.  Although there are different forms of
    agreement for residential, multiple dwelling unit, condominium and commercial subscribers,
    the terms of the Subscriber Agreements are similar. All of the agreements
    include some form of the following provisions:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>a.     Billing
    is monthly in advance of providing the service. The bill stipulates a payment
    due date, being 25 days after the bill date (in practice, payment is due before
    about two-thirds of the services have been provided);</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>b.      Overdue
    amounts are charged interest at the following rates: (a) a compound interest
    rate of two percent (2%) per month (26.82% per year); or (b) the highest
    interest rate permissible by law, at the appellants’ discretion, until paid in
    full;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>c.      The
    appellants have the right to disconnect a service, without notice or demand, if
    an account is not paid in full within 30 days after the due date, and to charge
    a deactivation fee of $50.00; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>d.      If an
    account remains unpaid for 60 days (45 days for multiple dwelling units) an

    noted above, the appellants have the right under their various Subscriber Agreements
    to disconnect a subscriber as soon as an account is 30 days past due.  Their usual practice, however, is to wait
    until an account is 50 days overdue before disconnecting service.  This is a unilateral decision on their part
    to forbear. In some cases, the appellants do not wait until an account is 50
    days past due and instead choose to disconnect a subscriber’s service as soon
    as it is permissible under the terms of the contract.</span></p>

    appellants incur costs when an account enters their collection stream and they

    associated with individual accounts is impracticable, the appellants undertook
    a review of the collection-related costs incurred when subscribers’ accounts
    remain outstanding for more than 60 days. The appellants conducted their first
    such review in 2002, and determined that the average collection cost was $19.00
    per subscriber. They undertook a second review in 2004, which determined that
    the average collection cost had risen to at least $25.00 per subscriber.  Following the second review, the appellants
    increased the administration fee in the Subscriber Agreement from $19.00 to $25.00
    where a subscriber’s account remains unpaid for 60 days.  An account that is unpaid for 60 days is
    overdue by 35 days.</span></p>

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Reasons of the Motion Judge</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge concluded that that the administration fee, together with the
    interest charged on accounts at least 5 days overdue, forms part of an
    agreement or arrangement to advance credit. Consequently, he held that the
    administration fee constitutes interest and depending on how promptly it is
    paid, it translates into an interest rate exceeding 60 per cent per year contrary
    to s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Central
    to the motion judge’s analysis was the evidence that, although the
    administration fee is charged on day 60 (35 days past the due date), the
    appellants’ </span><span lang=EN>practice is to
    disconnect a subscriber’s service only on day 75 (50 days past the due date). Applying
    the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Garland
    v. Consumers’ Gas Co.</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 112, the motion judge stated at
    para. 54: “In the case at bar, <u>practically speaking, there was a definite
    extension of credit</u> at least until 15 days after the administration fee was
    imposed, at which time the service would be disconnected. The price of this
    extension of credit was the administration fee, which makes the administration
    fee interest.” [emphasis in original]  </span></p>

    arriving at this conclusion, the motion judge found that a subscriber is
    permitted to pay after the due date because the appellants “<span class=GramE>tolerate[</span>],
    accept[], agree[] or acquiesce[] to the state of affairs that the debtor may
    pay after the due date, which is to say that [they] will not enforce the
    contract by claiming compensation; i.e. damages, or other remedies for the
    breach otherwise entailed by the late payment”: para. 36.  In his view, this arrangement gives subscribers
    the impression that, if they pay the interest and administration fee, they may
    delay payment for the services they have already received and yet continue to
    receive service. </span></p>

    parties rely on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Garland</i> in support of their positions.  In <i>Garland</i>,
    the Supreme Court considered whether a late payment penalty for unpaid gas
    bills constituted interest pursuant to s.&nbsp;347 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  The monthly
    bills sent by Consumers’ Gas Co. to its customers stipulated a date by which
    payment was due and provided that customers who did not pay by the due date
    were assessed a one-time late payment penalty equal to five per cent of the
    unpaid bill.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    court in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Garland</i><i> </i>laid out the basic interpretive framework for s. 347.  As a preliminary observation, it noted that
    “for the purposes of s. 347 ‘interest’ is an extremely comprehensive term,
    encompassing many types of fixed payments which would not be considered
    interest proper at common law or under general accounting principles”: para.
    27. The court further noted that s. 347 applies to a wide range of transactions,
    as “mandated by the extremely broad compass given to [the terms “credit” and
    “interest”] by Parliament under s. 347”: para. 51. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Supreme Court directed that, as a first step, the court should determine
    whether the charge in question is paid or payable for the advancing of credit.  In analyzing this question, the court should
    look beyond the form of the payment relationship between the parties and focus
    on its substance. The Supreme Court held that s. 347 applies not only to traditional
    lending relationships but also to contracts for the provision of services, as
    was the case in <i>Garland</i>, where the
    “agreement or arrangement permits a debtor to pay later than the time at which
    the payment would otherwise have been due”: para. 35.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If
    credit is found to be advanced, the second step of the analysis is to determine
    whether it is advanced pursuant to an agreement or arrangement between the
    parties.  In this context, the court held
    that s. 347 would “not apply to situations in which a buyer or consumer fails
    to pay on time, without the consent of the other party, for goods, services or
    benefits provided”: para. 45.  Put
    another way, where the agreement provides the subscriber with an option to pay
    late, the parties are taken to have reached an agreement where credit may be
    extended in exchange for payment of a fee. Where the late payment fee is “[c]<span
class=SpellE>ompensation</span> for the cost of payment deferred”, it is considered
    interest under s. 347: para. 47.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Importantly,
    the Supreme Court noted that the intention of the creditor in implementing a
    late payment fee, for instance, to deter customers from late bill payments, is not
    determinative of whether the fee falls within the definition of “interest” in
    s. 347.  In the court’s view, “[t]he nature
    of the arrangement between Consumers’ Gas and its customers is a question of
    law.  That question turns on how the [late
    payment penalty] operates in substance, not on what [Consumers’ Gas] hopes to
    achieve by imposing it”: para. 48.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Supreme Court noted that the terms of the standard agreement between the company
    and its subscribers provided “in plain <span class=GramE>language, that</span> a customer’s gas bill may be paid either before or after the due date”: para.
    45.  Therefore, the court concluded that the
    five per cent late payment penalty “incurred, pursuant to the terms of a standing
    arrangement between the parties, for the deferral of payment of a specified
    amount of money owing for goods, services or benefits is an ‘interest’ charge
    within the meaning of s. 347”: para. 53. </span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Position of the
    Parties</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants argue that the motion judge erred in characterizing the
    administration fee as interest under s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. They advance two related, but distinct, reasons in
    support of their position.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the appellants submit that the terms of the Subscriber Agreements require that
    bill payments be made by the due date.  In their submission, the Subscriber Agreements do not offer a deferral
    option. If a subscriber takes credit from the appellants by deferring bill
    payment while still receiving services, the subscriber is taking this credit
    unilaterally, in breach of and not in accordance with the terms of the
    agreement.  Unlike the situation in <i>Garland</i>, where the standing arrangement
    provided for payment of one price on the due date and another price after the
    due date, the Subscriber Agreements between the appellants and their subscribers
    provide no contractual right to defer bill payment. Therefore, there is no
    arrangement between the appellants and their subscribers that expressly or
    impliedly gives subscribers an option to defer payment. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the appellants submit that the administration fee is not a charge for advancing
    credit. Rather, it is a charge to recover the costs actually incurred when they
    are required to collect from subscribers whose accounts are overdue and who
    are, therefore, in breach of contract.  In
    the appellants’ view, the administration fee is solely directed at the recovery
    of collection costs and is different from the late payment penalty in <i>Garland</i>, which was found to be a charge payable
    by the subscriber in exchange for the option to defer bill payment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants challenge the motion judge’s finding that, because the appellants
    continue to perform under the Subscriber Agreements and normally do not
    disconnect a subscriber’s service until the account is 50 days past due (15
    days after the administration fee is levied), the administration fee can be
    characterized as the cost of advancing credit. </span><span lang=EN>They submit that </span><span lang=EN-US>the administration fee </span><span lang=EN>is expressly authorized by the terms of the Subscriber
    Agreements and is levied as liquidated damages where an account holder has
    breached the terms of the contract by not paying the account in a timely manner.
    Allowing a subscriber’s service to continue is unrelated to the administration
    fee and does not provide a basis for implying a term into the Subscriber
    Agreements that payment of the fee allows the subscriber to have credit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent argues that, in continuing to provide service under the Subscriber
    Agreement even after a subscriber has failed to pay the monthly bill by the due
    date, the appellants have, in effect, arranged to provide credit to the subscriber.  In other words, by their actions, the
    appellants are accepting that there may be a delay in bill payments. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
    of this, the respondent submits that the Subscriber Agreement is no different,
    in substance, to the agreement in <i>Garland</i>.  Although the Subscriber Agreement provides
    that the subscriber must pay the bill by the due date, the substance or effect of
    that agreement is quite different.  When
    the subscriber “breaches” the agreement by failing to pay his or her bill by
    the due date, interest starts to accrue at a rate of two per cent per month.  There is, it is argued, no breach of the
    agreement in the true sense because the appellants cannot, in accordance with
    the terms of the agreement, terminate the service for at least 30 days.  This is what the respondent referred to in oral
    argument as the “first phase” of the credit advance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    “second phase” of the credit advance, as characterized by the respondent, begins
    when the administration fee is levied.  In
    this second phase, a subscriber technically in default under the terms of the Subscriber
    Agreement is normally allowed to continue to receive service for a period of
    approximately 15 days after the administration fee is charged.  According to the respondent, because the
    appellants’ practice is, for this 15-day period, to take no action to
    discontinue service or otherwise collect the debt of a subscriber who pays the
    administration fee, this fee constitutes interest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    broad terms, the respondent submits that after day 25 – the date on which the
    bill payment is due – the relationship between the appellants and the subscriber
    becomes one of lender and borrower.  The
    terms of that lending arrangement are set out in the Subscriber Agreement and
    by the appellants’ established practice.  Essentially, although bill payment is
    technically required by the due date, the Subscriber Agreement effectively allows
    a subscriber to delay payment, initially, at a cost of two per cent interest
    per month. When the account is 35 days overdue, the subscriber is charged an
    administration fee which, by virtue of the appellants’ established practice,
    allows a further delay in payment of 15 days.  Because the Subscriber Agreement prevents disconnection of the account
    before it is 30 days overdue and the established practice is to extend this
    period to 50 days, the respondent’s decision not to pay by the due date cannot
    be seen to be in breach of the agreement. Rather, it is to be taken as the
    respondent exercising the option provided in the Subscriber Agreement to
    receive credit.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    entering into such an arrangement, the respondent maintains that the appellants
    advance credit to subscribers who choose to pay their bills late. As such, the Subscriber
    Agreement is subject to the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions which prohibit a return on lending at an interest rate in excess of
    60 per cent.  </span></p>

    the proper approach for determining whether a fee or charge levied by a service

    other hand.  Where the relationship between
    the parties is exclusively one of lending money, any additional charges or fees
    are inherently connected to the lending of money or the advancing of credit,
    regardless of their label.  Generally
    speaking, such fees are likely to fall within the definition of interest in s.
    347. </span></p>

    where the relationship between the parties is principally one of service
    provider and subscriber, extra charges and fees may be, but are not
    necessarily, connected to the advancing of credit. Therefore, even where a
    service agreement is found to have an advancing of credit component because it
    allows a subscriber to defer bill payment at a cost, fees and charges that are properly
    related to the service being provided are not somehow transformed into fees or
    charges related to the advancing of credit. In such cases, the court is called
    upon to look at the true nature of the arrangement and of the charges incurred
    to determine whether the charges are interest as defined in s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>

    this context, a parallel between the late payment penalty at issue in <span
class=SpellE><i>Kilroy</i></span><i> </i>and the administration fee in the case
    at bar cannot, as the motion judge suggested, be drawn. <span class=SpellE><i>Kilroy</i></span> involved a late payment
    penalty and processing fee charged by a lender on paycheque advances made to
    borrowers. In determining that the late payment penalty in that case was
    interest within s. 347 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, the B.C. Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the late
    fee was a penalty tied to the advancement of credit and “not merely the
    recovery of a disbursement”: para. 20. Given that the motion judge in the
    present case made an unchallenged finding that the administration fee charged
    by the appellants represents a legitimate estimate of the cost they incurred in
    collecting on overdue accounts, <span class=SpellE><i>Kilroy</i></span> is clearly distinguishable.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    the Supreme Court noted in <i>Garland</i>, it
    is both “formalistic and unpersuasive” to contend that a fee or charge falls
    within the scope of s. 347 simply because it is in the nature of a penalty.
    Rather, “[t]he issue is whether that penalty constitutes, in substance, a cost
    incurred by customers to receive credit under an arrangement” with the service
    provider: para. 30. In other words, the fee or charge at issue must be sufficiently
    connected to the credit in order to be considered “paid or payable” for its
    advance. </span></p>

    my view, charging a subscriber for the legitimate cost of collecting on an
    overdue account for the provision of programming services is more properly
    characterized as recovery of a disbursement than as a cost or penalty for the
    advancing of credit.  As I have noted,
    the motion judge found that the $25.00 administration fee is a legitimate
    pre-estimate of the costs incurred by the appellants when accounts remain outstanding
    for more than 60 days.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
    is some confusion in the present case because the Subscription Agreements allow
    (or at least tolerate) deferral of bill payment for 30 days without loss of
    service at an additional cost of two per cent interest per month. The
    respondent has argued that this 30 day grace period constitutes an advance of
    credit. The respondent further argues that, because the administration fee is
    charged shortly after the end of the grace period and, in practice, extends the
    period before service is disconnected, both the fee and the two per cent
    interest charge form part and parcel of the cost of deferring payment.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    cannot accept this argument. On the facts of this case, the administration fee
    represents the cost to the appellants of dealing with accounts overdue by 35
    days against which the fee is levied.  It
    is clear that such a fee would be entirely legitimate as liquidated damages if the
    Subscription Agreement provided that it was to be levied the moment the account
    became 35 days overdue, and on the same day the appellants immediately discontinued
    service. In my view, the character of the administration fee is not changed
    simply because the appellants might, in most cases, unilaterally decide to
    delay disconnection.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    accepting for the purposes of this decision that the 30 day grace period
    constitutes the advancing of credit, this still does not change the character
    of the administration fee. The fee continues to be unrelated to the advancing
    of credit.  In fact, imposing the
    administration fee on day 60 (35 days overdue) signals to the subscriber the
    end of any grace period and that service disconnection is imminent.  The fee is levied after the appellants are
    entitled, by contract, to terminate the service.  It comes after the subscriber has received an
    automated call on day 45 advising that, in order to avoid the possible
    interruption of service and the levying of the administration charge, payment
    must be received within 10 days.  This
    call is followed up by a final notice in the next monthly bill advising that,
    because payment was not received in the last 60 days, the account has been
    subjected to “both a 2% interest charge and a $25.00 administration fee.”  The customer is told that in order to avoid
    disconnection, payment must be sent “immediately”.      </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the facts, therefore, nothing suggests that the $25.00 administration fee levied
    on day 60 (35 days past due) entitles or allows the customer to defer payment

    motion judge considered it significant that the appellants’ practice is to not
    disconnect a subscriber’s service until after the administration fee is levied.
    He noted at para. 42 of his reasons that “[u]<span class=SpellE>nder</span> this arrangement, it would appear to the subscriber that he or she can delay
    payment for the services…without losing the benefit of the contract for
    television services”.  In my view, the
    record does not support this conclusion and, even if it did, such a perception
    is of no relevance to the issues to be determined.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    the appellants conceded that it is their general practice not to disconnect a
    subscriber’s service until day 75, there was evidence that in some cases
    service is disconnected on day 55, as soon as permitted under the Subscriber
    Agreement. It may well be that a frequently delinquent subscriber, like the
    respondent, knows from experience that the appellants are not likely to
    disconnect service on day 55.  However, the
    appellants’ unilateral decision to delay disconnection until day 75 may be
    changed at any point in time and would not be apparent to the vast majority of
    subscribers.  It is not a term of the
    Subscriber Agreement and there is no evidence to suggest that it has been
    communicated to subscribers by way of written or oral representations. To the
    contrary, the “call blast” on day 45 advises a subscriber that service may be
    disconnected. In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that frequently
    delinquent subscribers are more likely to have their service disconnected on
    day 55.</span></p>

    disconnect service is, in my view, irrelevant.  It is the deferral of payment, not the continued provision of <span
class=GramE>service, that</span> constitutes an advancing of credit. As
    explained in <i>Garland</i>, credit under a
    service agreement is not advanced until payment for the service is otherwise
    due.  Under the terms of the Subscriber
    Agreement, the payment for continued service on any account, overdue or not, is
    not due until 25 days after the monthly bill for that continued service is sent
    to the subscriber.</span></p>

    $25.00 administration fee is perceived by subscribers in coming to his
    conclusion that the fee is paid for the advancing of credit under an agreement
    or arrangement. As set out in<i> Garland</i>,
    the nature of the agreement or arrangement between the parties is a question of
    law. The determination turns on how the arrangement operates in substance, not
    on what either party hopes to achieve by implementing and/or agreeing to it. On
    the facts of this case, the evidence established that the administration fee is
    a legitimate estimate of the costs incurred by the appellants in dealing with
    an individual overdue account. </span></p>
