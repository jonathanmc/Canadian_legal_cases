    Deena <span class=SpellE>Naw</span>, argued constantly about money and where
    Ms. Naw’s parents should live.  Ms. Naw
    wanted to buy a new home, a bigger place where her parents, she and Moo could
    live together.  Moo thought
    otherwise.  Moo didn’t like his wife’s
    father and wanted no part of any shared accommodation, much less going into
    debt to purchase it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite their differences, Moo
    and <span class=SpellE>Naw</span> went house hunting on September 8, 2001.  During preparations for their evening meal,
    the couple re-invigorated their long-standing acrimony over where Ms. Naw’s
    parents should live.  Moo picked up a
    four and one-half pound mortar in which he had been grinding chili peppers, <span
class=GramE>then</span> hit his wife at least twice over the head with it.  The force of the blows shattered Ms. Naw’s
    skull and caused her irreversible brain damage.  She died later in hospital.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The jury convicted Moo (the
    appellant) of second degree murder, the offence with which he was charged.  The appellant claimed that his crime was
    manslaughter, not murder.  He says that
    his conviction is flawed and a new trial should be directed for two reasons:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER"><span lang=EN-US>            <span class=SpellE>i</span>.          the trial judge misdirected the jury
      in responding to their question about the definition of murder in s.
      229(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and,
      in particular,  about the meaning of recklessness;
      and</span></p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER"><span lang=EN-US>            ii.         <span
class=GramE>the</span> trial judge erred in admitting several ante-mortem
      statements of the deceased into evidence as exceptions
      to the hearsay rule and the rule that generally
      bars prosecution evidence of an accused’s bad character.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I
    would not give effect to either complaint and would dismiss the appeal from
    conviction. The appellant abandoned his appeal against the period of parole
    ineligibility fixed by the trial judge. I would dismiss that appeal as
    abandoned.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A brief overview of the
    essential features of the evidence will suffice at the beginning with greater
    detail summoned as the circumstances of a specific ground of appeal commands it.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         The Principals and their Relationship</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and deceased,
    both political refugees from Burma, met shortly after the deceased arrived in
    Canada in 1994.  The couple married in
    1997.  As devout “Karen” Christians,
    their social life revolved around their church.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Conflicts about money dominated
    the couple’s relationship.  The appellant
    worked part-time, attended community college and wanted to save money for his
    later years.  The deceased worked several
    jobs so that she could send money to her family in refugee camps in Burma.  The appellant resented the financial
    assistance his wife provided to her family.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         The Arrival of the
      Deceased’s Parents</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The deceased convinced her
    church to sponsor her parents to come to Canada.  Both parents, who were in their 70s, arrived
    in Canada on November 30, 2000.  They
    immediately joined the appellant and the deceased in a two bedroom apartment
    that the couple rented.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         The Appellant and the
      Deceased’s Parents</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It didn’t take long for the
    appellant to cultivate an intense dislike for the deceased’s father.  He considered his father-in-law’s demands for
    newspapers, extra cable channels and improved internet service to be excessive
    and beyond the couple’s limited financial means.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The deceased wanted her parents
    to live with her and the appellant, preferably in larger premises than they
    then occupied. The appellant would not abide his in-law’s occupation of the
    same premises – he wanted them out and living on their own, elsewhere.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>4.         The Summer Ultimatum</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During the summer of 2001, the
    appellant delivered an ultimatum to his wife.  She could remain with him or she could move elsewhere to live with her
    parents.  When the couple’s lease expired
    on November 30, 2001, the deceased’s parents would have to find another place
    to live.  And if the deceased left the
    appellant, he would kill her.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The deceased was in a quandary.  She wanted to follow the dictates of her
    culture and have her <span class=GramE>parents,</span> her husband and herself
    live together.  She could not afford to
    support her parents in separate housing. She was convinced that her parents,
    whose sponsorship agreement was to end at the same time as the couple’s apartment
    lease, couldn’t manage on their own.  Neither parent had any income.  Both were old. Both had health problems.  Neither was fluent in English.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The deceased sought assistance
    from her church and its ministers to resolve her dilemma.  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>5.         House Hunting</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 29, 2001, the
    appellant and the deceased gave notice to their landlord that they intended to vacate
    their leased apartment when their lease expired on November 30, 2001.  On September 8, 2001, the couple went house
    hunting.  In the late afternoon, they
    found a place they both liked and resolved to speak to their bankers about
    arranging financing for their prospective purchase.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>6.         The Argument</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly after their return
    home, however, the appellant and deceased resumed their argument over where the
    deceased’s parents would live after the couple’s current lease expired.  Neither ceded any ground to the other.  It was in the course of this argument that the
    appellant struck his wife’s head with at least two very forceful blows of the
    mortar.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>7.         The 911 Call</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly before 6:00 p.m. on
    September 8, 2001, the appellant called 911. He explained to the operator that
    he had made a mistake, a very, very big mistake.  He had hit his wife very, very hard with
    something that was very, very heavy.  At
    least three times the appellant told the 911 operator – “I tried to kill my wife
    now”.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>8.         The Cause of Death</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The deceased died from cranial
    cerebral injury. She suffered multiple skull fractures caused by the repeated
    application of significant force.  The
    emergency room physician described the deceased’s head injuries as the most
    severe he had ever seen, and likened them to injuries caused by a person
    falling from a considerable height. A neurosurgeon characterized the deceased’s
    injuries as eggshell fractures, likely caused by repeated blows.  The examining pathologist concluded that the
    deceased had been struck at least twice, but more likely four times.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>9.         The Appellant’s Version</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After his arrest and
    discussions with his lawyer, the appellant spoke with investigators twice.  On both occasions, the interview was recorded
    and later transcribed.  The first
    interview occurred before the deceased died, but after the appellant had been
    charged with attempted murder.  The
    second interview took place after the deceased had died and the appellant had
    been charged with second degree murder.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the first interview, the
    appellant explained that he and the deceased had arrived home at their
    apartment at about 5:00 p.m. on September 8, 2001.  They had looked at several houses in their
    search for a new place to live after their apartment lease expired.  As preparations for supper began, the
    appellant wanted to speak to his wife in the living room about their
    future.  He explained to her that they
    had to save money to ensure their future security and reproached her, to no
    avail, for the sums she had lavished on her parents.  Those expenditures, which the appellant
    regarded as extravagant, were constant irritants in their marriage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also complained
    to investigators about his mother-in-law and father-in-law. The chief fault of
    the deceased’s mother was that she talked too much. The appellant’s
    father-in-law was a different story:  he
    insisted on more newspapers, fuller television and expanded internet service so
    that he could keep track of events in Burma.  After one argument, the appellant’s father-in-law decamped, indicating
    that he would not return unless the deceased divorced the appellant. For his
    part, the appellant told his wife, in the clearest of terms, that he would not
    live in the same place as her parents after their lease and the period of her
    parents’ sponsorship ended in November, 2001.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant recalled that, as
    he was pounding the chilies for supper, “I began shock and I can’t control my
    anger”.  He got mad and pounded his wife
    twice on the head with the mortar.  He
    probably had both hands on the mortar when he hit the deceased, but he couldn’t
    be sure because he was so angry with her. Despite their constant arguments over
    finances, the appellant claimed that he had never hit his wife on any prior
    occasion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the appellant hit his
    wife, he thought, “Oh God.  I do
    mistake.”, then called the police.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During his second police
    interview, after he had been charged with second degree murder, the appellant
    described the attack as an assault. He did not try “to kill her exactly”, and
    sought forgiveness for what he had done. At the end of the second interview,
    the appellant acknowledged that he had told the police the truth during his
    first interview.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant advances two
    discrete grounds of appeal against his conviction.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first allegation of error
    has to do with the trial judge’s response to a question submitted by the jury
    during their deliberations.  The jury
    wanted clarification on the state of mind required to prove murder under s.
    229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, including a definition of “reckless”.  The essence of the complaint is that the definition of “reckless” the
    trial judge provided to the jury, drawn from <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Sansregret</span></i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570,
    was wrong, thus leaving it open to the jury to convict the appellant of murder
    on the basis of a fault element less demanding than the law requires.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second complaint concerns
    the reception of several ante-mortem statements made by the deceased to or in
    the presence of others who testified as prosecution witnesses.  The reception of this evidence, according to
    the appellant, offended not only the hearsay rule, but also the prohibition
    against the prosecution introducing evidence of an accused’s bad character.</span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>The First Ground:
    Alleged Misdirection on the Fault Element in Murder under s. 229(a<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the main charge, the trial
    judge instructed the jury on the definition of murder contained in both
    paragraphs of s. 229(a).  During these
    instructions, he explained to the jury how they could determine the appellant’s
    state of mind at the time he unlawfully killed his wife.  The trial judge also set out the positions of
    the parties on the fault element required to make an unlawful killing murder,
    and related the essential features of the evidence to that fault element and
    the parties’ positions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant does not, for
    that matter could not, complain about the adequacy and correctness of the main
    charge on the fault element in murder and the manner in which the jury could
    determine it.  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         The Objections to the
      Charge</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The only objection to the
    charge that is material to this ground of appeal came from the prosecutor who
    expressed a different concern about the instruction on recklessness. She wanted
    the trial judge to clarify the relationship between the recklessness component

    The misdirection, in other words, was wedged between two correct

    the jury has sought further instruction: <i>S.

    liability for murder is an appreciation of the precise role recklessness plays
    in the fault element in s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).  As a constituent of the fault element in s.
    229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), recklessness has been described as “almost
    an afterthought”: <span class=SpellE><i>Nygaard</i></span>,
    at p. 435; <i>Cooper</i>,<i> </i>at p. 294.  After all, to secure a conviction of murder
    under s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), the prosecutor must prove beyond
    a reasonable doubt that an accused intended to cause such serious bodily harm
    that the accused knew it would likely kill the victim.  Anyone who intentionally causes bodily harm
    that he or she knows is likely to kill must, in the cold light of day, have a
    deliberate disregard for the fatal outcome that he or she knows is likely to
    follow.  Said in another way, he or she
    must be <i>reckless</i> whether the victim
    dies or not: <i>Cooper</i>, at p. 294.</span></p>

    fault element in s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), the most crucial is
    the intention to cause bodily harm that the perpetrator knows will likely kill,
    yet persists in the assault: <span class=SpellE><i>Nygaard</i></span>, at p. 435. Recklessness really adds nothing in its
    requirement that the fatal assault be carried out heedlessly in the face of
    actual knowledge of the obvious risks: <span class=SpellE><i>Nygaard</i></span>,<i> </i>at p.
    435.  An assessment of the impact of an
    error about the meaning to be assigned to recklessness must include a
    clear-eyed view of the role of recklessness in the fault element in s. 229(a<span

    their finding of guilt on the definition of murder in s. 229(a)(ii), they must
    have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally
    caused the deceased bodily harm that the appellant knew would likely cause her

    homicide, evidence is frequently admitted to elucidate the nature of the
    relationship between the accused and the deceased. This evidence, which often
    discloses misconduct other than that charged, not only demonstrates the nature
    of the relationship between the parties, but also may afford evidence of motive
    and animus relevant to establish the identity of the deceased’s killer and the
    state of mind with which the killing was done: <i>R. v. Chapman</i> (2006), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 27; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Cudjoe</span> </i>2009

    comes with baggage – moral prejudice (the potential stigma of “bad personhood”)
    and reasoning prejudice (including potential confusion and distraction of the
    jury from the actual crime charged): <i>Handy</i>,

lang=EN-US>Where evidence of extrinsic misconduct is admitted, one antidote to
    ensure that prejudice does not substitute for proof are mid-trial and final
    cautions that educate jurors about the permitted and prohibited use of the
    evidence. This general rule does not apply, however, where the extrinsic
    misconduct evidence is offered to demonstrate motive or animus towards the
    victim in a prosecution for unlawful homicide: <i>R. v. Jackson </i>(1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 154 (Ont. C.A.), at pp.
    168-169; <i>R. v. <span class=GramE>Merz <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Appellate deference is due to the decisions of
    trial judges determining that hearsay evidence meets the test of threshold
    reliability and that the probative value of evidence, whether hearsay or
    extrinsic misconduct, exceeds its prejudicial effect: <i>R. v. Couture</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not interfere with the trial judge’s
    determination that the ante-mortem statements of the deceased met the reliability
    threshold, thus were not excluded by the hearsay rule.  Nor would I interfere with the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the probative value of this evidence exceeded its prejudicial
    effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although his ruling preceded the decisions in <i><span lang=EN-US>Khelawon</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, <i>Couture </i>and <i>Blackman</i>, the trial judge’s approach is
    faithful to their mandate.  He examined
    the circumstances surrounding each statement to determine whether those
    circumstances provided sufficient comfort in their truth and accuracy to
    warrant their admission.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The deceased’s statements to the two ministers
    of the church she attended were made for the purpose of obtaining advice about
    how to resolve a family crisis.  They,
    like the others, were spontaneous outpourings of the declarant, not answers
    given to leading questions or as a result of any improper influence by the
    recipient.  The statements were not made
    during or in contemplation of any legal proceedings and were confined by the
    trial judge to discussions within a reasonable time before the deceased’s
    death.  None were under oath or its
    equivalent nor recorded in whole or in part by the recipient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence adduced is unrevealing of any
    motive on the deceased’s part to lie in her statements to others.  In many respects, the appellant’s own statement
    to investigators contains much of what the deceased said to others.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The deceased’s ante-mortem statements to others
    were relevant and material.  They tended
    to show the true nature of the relationship between the appellant and deceased,
    casting it in a different light than as described by the appellant.  These statements reveal animus and motive on
    the part of the appellant, thus bearing on the issue of whether his unlawful
    killing of the deceased was murder or manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An assessment and balancing of probative value
    and prejudicial effect was required to determine whether otherwise admissible
    hearsay should be excluded and otherwise inadmissible evidence of extrinsic
    misconduct (embedded in otherwise admissible hearsay) should be admitted.  To some, this commingling of exclusionary
    rules may warrant two discrete inquiries because the onus may not fall on the
    same party in each. That said<span class=GramE>,</span> there is no basis upon
    which to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the balance fell in
    favour of admission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While moral and reasoning prejudice is inherent
    in any evidence of extrinsic misconduct, its influence may vary significantly
    from one case to the next, depending, in part at least, on the nature and
    extent of the misconduct.  Here, the
    extrinsic misconduct paled by comparison to the conduct charged.  In some instances, it reflected more badly on
    others, for example, the deceased’s father, than on the appellant. The sting of
    any prejudice was largely alleviated by the limiting instructions given by the
    trial judge forbidding propensity reasoning, instructions that were more
    favourable than those to which the appellant was entitled.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal
    from conviction.  The appeal from the
    period of parole ineligibility imposed by the trial judge was abandoned by Mr.
    Harris in his factum and oral argument.  I
    would dismiss that appeal as an abandoned appeal.</p>
