    of leaving the scene of the accident and public mischief for falsely reporting
    his vehicle stolen. Following a trial by a judge, sitting without a jury, he was
    convicted of impaired driving causing death, “over 80” and impaired driving
    causing bodily harm.<a href="#_ftn1"

    appellant was driving the truck that caused the accident. The sole issue was
    whether the appellant was impaired at the time of the accident. That issue turned
    on an assessment of his credibility.</span></p>

    the accident, he panicked, fled the scene and went home and started drinking
    heavily. Approximately three hours after the accident he was found to be
    impaired. The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence in its entirety,
    citing several reasons for disbelieving him. </span></p>

    reasons for rejecting the appellant’s testimony were available to him on the
    evidence, in my view he committed two errors in assessing the appellant’s
    credibility. First, he misapprehended two separate pieces of evidence. Second, he
    erred in drawing adverse inferences against the appellant for failing to call
    evidence to confirm various aspects of his testimony. </span></p>

    of the <i>Charter</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    day of the accident, he was feeling ill. He drove to work, but decided to
    return home before work started. When he returned home, he went to bed. He got
    up in the afternoon and cleared his driveway of snow at about 3:00 p.m. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The appellant said that he then went to
    a bar called Misty’s Fifties where he stayed for about fifteen minutes and
    drank one beer. Before returning home, he went to a drug store to get some cold
    medicine, then to the dry cleaners, and to a video store to buy cigarettes. A
    receipt was entered into evidence showing that he purchased a carton of
    cigarettes at about 3:40 p.m.</span></p>

    the Crown. She said that the appellant came into the store and bought the
    cigarettes. She recalled smelling alcohol on the appellant’s breath and said,
    “I knew that he had been drinking”, since his eyes were rolling and he was
    looking up at the ceiling. She did not think that the appellant should have been
    driving. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The appellant testified that around 4:30
    p.m., he left his house again and went to the Roosevelt Hotel bar, which is located
    on Korah Road, near the scene of the accident. There, he drank a light beer and
    ordered a second, which he may or may not have finished. At the bar, he ran
    into Amanda Morissette, who was dating one of his friends from work. He ordered
    Ms. Morissette a beer, chatted with her and wrote her phone number down on a
    cigarette package. </span></p>

    the Roosevelt Hotel who served the appellant. They testified that they served
    the appellant two light beers. The bar manager, who knew the appellant as a
    regular customer, testified that the appellant was talking straight and that “[h]e
    didn’t seem like he was intoxicated, by any means”. </span></p>

    Roosevelt Hotel and drove north onto Korah Road. From Korah Road, he turned
    left onto Second Line. After turning onto Second Line, a truck in front of him
    put on its brakes.  The appellant tried
    to avoid the truck and his vehicle went sideways into the oncoming lane.  He struck a van head-on, killing the driver
    and injuring one of the passengers. </span></p>

    the accident, he got out of his truck, panicked and fled the scene. His
    explanation for fleeing was that he had two previous convictions for drinking
    and driving and two for driving under suspension and that since he had just
    left the bar, it was not “going to look good” for him. He said that he was not
    impaired at the time of the accident.</span></p>

    home on foot through parking lots, over fences and through backyards. He went
    between his house and the house next door through a laneway so as not to leave
    footprints on the snow in his yard. He went in the rear door, because he expected
    the police to come and he wanted to get out of sight. </span></p>

    MacKnight was informed that the appellant was the owner of the truck involved
    in the collision. He went to the appellant’s house at 5:47 p.m. The house was
    dark. Constable MacKnight knocked on the front door and then on the side door.
    The appellant assumed it was the police and did not respond. </span></p>

    the officer left, he began to drink “to calm his nerves down”. He said that he drank
    over six beers and about a quarter of a bottle of Yukon Jack. Unexpectedly, his
    mother came to the house. When she told him that his truck wasn’t in the yard,
    he told her that somebody must have stolen it. He then phoned the police and
    reported it stolen. He said that he had nothing more to drink after his mother
    arrived. Shortly afterwards, a friend of the appellant, Shane Burt, arrived and
    told the appellant that his truck had been involved in an accident. </span></p>

    p.m., Constable MacKnight returned to the appellant’s house with another
    officer, Constable Burrows. The appellant invited the officers in. His mother
    and Mr. Burt were at the house at the time. Constable McKnight testified that
    the appellant told them that he had gone to work that day, but had returned
    home. He told the officers that after clearing his driveway in the afternoon, he
    went to sleep because he was feeling sick. He said that he left his truck on
    the roadway with the keys in it. When his mother arrived, he realized that the
    truck was missing. The appellant told the officers that he had not been
    drinking. Both officers noticed an open case of beer in the living room.
    Constable Burrows testified that he smelled alcohol on the appellant’s breath
    at the house. </span></p>

    Burt drove the appellant to the station. There, the officers formed the opinion
    that the appellant’s ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired and arrested
    him. The appellant refused to make any further statements about the events that
    day. He did, however, agree to take a breathalyzer test. The readings taken at
    8:54 p.m. and 9:14 p.m. were 163 and 159 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood,

    writing down her name and telephone number so as to permit him to contact her
    boyfriend to  arrange to ride snow
    machines, which is what he testified to in-chief.  In cross-examination, he admitted that he did

    establishing that the appellant lied to the court. In cross-examination, he
    agreed that he may have been trying to “hit on” Ms. Morissette, nothing more. He
    did <i>not</i> admit that he had no interest
    in contacting Brad to go snowmobiling as the trial judge said.  In my view, this evidence does not establish
    that the appellant lied to the court, especially since the Crown did not put
    the appellant’s earlier evidence to him in cross-examination.  Indeed, the appellant may have had more than
    one reason for talking to Ms. Morissette and asking for her phone number.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I find it incredible that if he had consumed all of
    the beer and the Yukon Jack, to which he testified, the two trained police
    officers who attended at his residence very shortly after he claims to have

    It was undisputed that the appellant had nothing to drink between his
    discussion with the officers at his house and the time he arrived at the
    station.  The logical inference is that
    there was a strong smell of alcohol on the appellant’s breath both at the house
    and at the station. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The

    unlikely that they could give credible opinions as to when the appellant drank
    the alcohol giving rise to the smell.</span></p>

    to testify to an odour of alcohol would not likely have added anything beyond
    what had already been established in evidence. Constable Burrows testified that
    he smelled alcohol on the appellant’s breath at the house and Constable
    MacKnight testified that he detected a strong smell of alcohol on the
    appellant’s breath at the police station. As discussed above, it was undisputed
    that the appellant had nothing to drink between the interview at his house and
    his arrival at the police station. </span></p>

    appellant’s mother could have testified to the presence of beer bottles and the
    Yukon Jack bottle in the house, and noted that the bottles could have been
    introduced by the defence as exhibits. However, Constables Burrows and
    MacKnight had already testified that they saw a case of beer and several empty
    bottles in the house.  In addition,
    introducing empty bottles at trial would not have added any independent support
    for the appellant’s testimony.  The value
    of such evidence would have depended entirely on the appellant being able to
    establish that the bottles being introduced were the same bottles from which he
    drank on the day in question.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The trial judge also attached weight
    to the appellant’s failure to produce receipts from the cleaners and the
    pharmacy, places that he said he had gone during the afternoon on the day of
    the accident.  Those receipts, at best,
    would have confirmed a relatively minor aspect of the appellant’s narrative and
    would have accounted for only limited periods of time.  Introducing the receipts would not have
    assisted the appellant in showing that he was not impaired before the
    accident.  </span></p>

    appellant for his failure to call evidence to confirm parts of his testimony. </span></p>

    judge erred in assessing the appellant’s credibility, the <i>curative proviso</i> can be applied as the errors did not amount to a
    miscarriage of justice or a substantial wrong. I disagree. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>In my view, the cumulative effect of the
    errors resulted in the convictions being a miscarriage of justice.  Significantly, the errors related to the
    trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility which was the central
    issue at trial.  On reading the trial
    judge’s reasons as a whole, I am not able to say that he would have reached the
    same conclusion had he not made the errors I refer to above.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>I recognize that several of the trial
    judge’s reasons for disbelieving the appellant were available to him on the
    record.  It may be that those reasons
    standing alone would have been sufficient for the trial judge to have
    disbelieved the appellant’s testimony.  However, the trial judge’s reasons that contain the errors form an
    integral part of his overall assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  It seems that the trial judge attached
    considerable weight to the erroneous reasons.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The trial judge emphasized what he
    characterized as the appellant’s “lie to this court” about the Amanda Morissette
    conversation.  He mentioned it twice in
    his reasons and said that it was significant.  He also referred to the evidence that the appellant failed to call as
    “significant” and went to some length to point out the specifics of what
    evidence he concluded the appellant should have called.  I do not think it is possible to disentangle
    the trial judge’s erroneous reasons from the remainder of his analysis of the
    appellant’s credibility and to conclude that he would necessarily have reached
    the same conclusion.  </span></p>

    appellant to three and one-half years concurrent for the two impaired driving
    charges. He also sentenced the appellant to one year, consecutive, on the failure
    to remain charge and 6 months concurrent on the public mischief charge. The
    appellant argues that if a new trial is ordered on the impaired driving
    charges, that the one year sentence on the other two charges is excessive and
    outside the range for those offences.</span></p>

    within the range for these serious offences.  </span></p>
