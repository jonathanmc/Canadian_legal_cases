lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Nantucket Business Centre (“the
    Landlord”), owns a building in a commercial strip mall.  The appellant, AB <span class=SpellE>Autorama</span> Ltd. (“the Tenant”), leases one of the units in the building for an automobile
    repair shop.  In February 2005, a fire
    started in the Tenant’s unit.  The fire
    caused damage to the building and its contents, interruption of business and a
    loss of profits.  In February 2007, the
    Landlord sued the Tenant in negligence for these damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties then brought a motion by a special case for
    the court’s opinion on the question whether the Landlord or its insurer was
    precluded from maintaining its claim for damages.  To answer this question, <span class=SpellE>Mesbur</span> J. had to decide which party, the Landlord or the Tenant, assumed the risk of loss
    caused by fire.  Ordinarily a Tenant is
    responsible for damages caused by its own negligence unless the terms of the
    lease show that the parties intended to transfer the risk of loss to the
    Landlord.  The motion judge concluded
    that under the terms of the Offer to Lease between the parties, the Tenant
    assumed the risk for any losses caused by the fire in its unit.  Accordingly, the Landlord’s action could
    proceed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tenant appeals on two grounds: it submits that the
    motion judge misinterpreted the Supreme Court of Canada’s jurisprudence on this
    question; and it submits that the motion judge misinterpreted the terms of the Offer
    to Lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with both submissions.  I would allow the appeal because in my view,
    under the terms of the Offer to Lease, the Landlord assumed the risk of fire
    loss.  Accordingly, neither it nor its
    subrogated insurer can maintain its claim against the Tenant.</p>
  <h4><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties brought their motion under Rule 22 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> on an agreed
    statement of facts, and asked the court to give its opinion on the following
    question of law:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the Agreed Statement of Facts, including the
    provisions of the Offer to Lease, has the Defendant established, as pleaded in
    its Statement of Defence, that the Plaintiff is precluded from maintaining its
    claim, subrogated or otherwise, in this action for the damages it alleged[<span
class=SpellE>ly</span>] sustained in a fire on February 9<sup>th</sup> 2005, at
    the premises it owned?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question refers to a subrogated claim because,
    although not expressly admitted, the action was undoubtedly started by the
    Landlord’s subrogated insurer.  The
    respondent did not assert otherwise.  Of
    course, the Landlord’s insurer in advancing a subrogated claim against the
    Tenant stands in the same position as the Landlord.  It has only the rights given by the Offer to Lease.  </p>

    this appeal depends on the terms of the Offer to Lease, I will set out its
    salient terms.  Four terms figured

    pivotal term is para. 1, which stipulates that the tenant shall pay its
    proportionate share of the operating costs of the building, including all costs
    in respect of, among other things, “Insurance”:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It is understood and agreed that:</span></p>

    is the intention of both parties that the Lease to be prepared shall be an
    absolutely net Lease and, therefore, will provide that the Tenant shall pay all
    costs in respect of maintenance, repair and replacement of the Premises, Realty
    Taxes, Insurance, Heating, Hydro, Water and Utilities of all kinds, any and all
    applicable taxes existing now and in the future, as well as the Proportionate
    Share (defined in the Lease) of Realty Taxes, and all costs incurred in the
    operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, management and insurance of the
    project in which the Premises are located.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Although the Tenant is required to contribute
    to the costs of insurance, the offer to lease does not contain a corresponding
    covenant of the Landlord to obtain insurance against, for example, fire

    obligations and maintain a proper and orderly operation as determined by the
    property manager, then the Landlord’s representative shall undertake to do the
    required work(s) and this shall be added to the rent(s)/additional rent and be

    main holding with which I take issue is found at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    7 and 8 of the motion judge’s reason, where she refers to the so-called
    “trilogy” – the three Supreme Court of Canada cases from the 1970s that
    canvassed the question of allocating risk of loss under a lease: <span
class=SpellE><i>Cummer-Yonge</i></span><i> Investments Ltd. v. Agnew-Surpass Shoe
    Stores Ltd.</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 221; <i>Ross
    Southward Tire Ltd. v. <span class=SpellE>Pyrotech</span> Products Ltd.</i>,
    [1976] 2 S.C.R. 35; and <i>T. Eaton Co. v. Smith</i>,
    [1978] 2 S.C.R. 749.  The motion judge
    was of the opinion that in each of these cases, unlike the present case, the
    landlord covenanted to insure the property against fire loss.  In her words:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[7] The plaintiff suggests that the current
    state of the law preserves the general rule that a tenant is responsible for
    damage caused by its own negligence and is not immune from a landlord’s suit,
    unless there is clear language in the lease to the contrary.  It says there is no such clear language here,
    and thus the plaintiff’s suit may continue against the tenant.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[8] What emerges from all the case law is that
    the result will turn on the express wording of the lease in <span class=GramE>question.</span>  <i>Here,
    the landlord points to the fact that in each of the trilogy cases, there was an
    express provision requiring the landlord to insure the premises against loss by
    fire.  Here, there is no such express
    provision, and thus the landlord says the trilogy</i><u> </u><i>cannot apply</i>.  The landlord goes further, and says that the
    express wording of the offer to lease leads to the same conclusion.  <i>I agree</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    problem with the motion judge’s analysis is that in one of the Supreme Court of
    Canada cases – the <i>Ross</i> case – the
    lease did not contain a covenant requiring the landlord to obtain insurance
    against fire loss.  Yet the Supreme Court
    of Canada held at pp. 39-41 that because the lease obligated the tenant to pay
    for insurance, the risk of loss by fire passed to the landlord and precluded a
    subrogated claim for fire loss by the landlord’s insurer:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
    for the appellant did not urge (indeed, he stated that it was not necessary to
    his position) that the landlord was in breach of a covenant to insure and that
    the covenant should have embraced risk of loss by fire resulting from the
    tenant’s negligence.  Rather, it was his
    contention that under the provision of the lease respecting payment of
    insurance rates by the tenant, the risk of loss by fire passed to the landlord,
    at least upon the presentation by the landlord of the insurance bill, and that
    the matter thereafter was between the landlord and its insurer.  I agree with this contention.  Applying to the lease and to the provision in
    question the ordinary test of reading it reasonably and in a business sense, I
    see no other meaning that can be given to the lease short of reading the
    relevant words out of it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my opinion, the landlord’s insurer has no basis for asserting a subrogated
    claim in the present case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    substance, the <i>Ross</i> case is identical
    to the present case, and is dispositive of this appeal.  The lease in <i>Ross</i> stipulated that “the lessee shall pay all realty taxes
    including local improvements and school taxes, electric power and water rates
    and <i>insurance rates</i> immediately when
    due” (emphasis added).  The Offer to Lease
    in the present case stipulates that “… the Tenant shall pay all costs in
    respect of … Insurance”.  In <i>Ross</i>, the lessee’s covenant did not
    specify fire insurance, but the Supreme Court of Canada had no difficulty in
    concluding that the obligation to pay all insurance rates included fire
    insurance.  Similarly, although the
    Tenant’s covenant in the Offer to Lease to contribute to the costs of insurance
    does not specify fire insurance, I have no difficulty in concluding that it
    includes the costs of fire insurance.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    rationale for the holding in <i>Ross</i> is
    simply that because the lessee paid for insurance, it gets the benefit of
    insurance coverage.  To permit the
    Landlord or the Landlord’s insurer to then sue the lessee for fire loss caused
    by its negligence would deprive the lessee of that benefit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
    if the Landlord’s negligence claim were permitted to proceed in this case, the
    Tenant would receive no benefit for its contribution to the cost of fire
    insurance.  The Tenant could be deprived
    of that benefit only if the Offer to Lease expressly said so.  There was no such provision in the lease in <i>Ross</i> and no such provision in this Offer
    to Lease.  See <i>Alberta Importers and Distributors (1993) Inc. v. Phoenix Marble Ltd.</i> (2006), 410 A.R. 78 (Q.B.), <span class=SpellE>aff’d</span> (2008), 432 A.R.
    173 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    the Tenant’s obligation under para. 1 of the Offer to Lease to contribute to
    the cost of insurance has the effect of allocating the risk of fire loss to the
    Landlord.  This result makes commercial
    sense.  Although the Offer to Lease does
    not contain an express covenant requiring the Landlord to obtain fire
    insurance, this Landlord, like any landlord with a similar lease, would, as a
    practical matter, obtain insurance coverage.  Even if the whole agreement clause excludes an implied covenant to do
    so, it would defy commercial reality for the Landlord not to insure its
    property.  In this case as in <i>Ross</i>, the Landlord did obtain insurance
    coverage.  See also <i>Tony and Jim’s Holdings Ltd. v. Silva </i>(1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 633

    acknowledge that there are similarities.  Under both the lease in <i>Lee-Mar</i> and the Offer to Lease, the tenant was obliged to pay for or contribute to the
    cost of insurance; neither the lease in <i>Lee-Mar</i> nor the Offer to Lease expressly obligated the landlord to insure its property;
    and both the lease in <i>Lee-Mar</i> and the
    Offer to Lease contained a whole agreement clause excluding any collateral

    there is an important factual difference between the lease in <i>Lee-Mar</i> and the Offer to Lease.  Under the lease in <i>Lee-Mar</i>, the tenant leased the entire building.  Under the Offer to Lease, the Tenant leased

    to Lease.  These two covenants were
    instrumental to <span class=SpellE>Chapnik</span> J.’s decision.  The first covenant was a broadly worded
    provision governing repairs where the tenant was at fault.  This provision obligated the tenant to pay
    for any damages or repairs to the building caused by its negligence or
    carelessness:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Notwithstanding

    facilities or improvements contained therein or made thereof, or the roof or
    outside walls of the Building or any other structural portions thereof, require
    repair or become damaged or destroyed through the negligence, carelessness or

    apparatus, water pipes, drainage pipes or other equipment or facilities or

    the Landlord.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second covenant was a provision that required the tenant to pay for and
    maintain in its name and in the name of the landlord insurance against property
    damage and tenant’s legal liability insurance “for the full replacement cost of
    the Premises”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the basis of these two covenants, especially the repair covenant, <span
class=SpellE>Chapnik</span> J. concluded that the tenant assumed the risk of
    loss from its negligence.  She wrote at
    para. 13 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, these two clauses are clear and
    unambiguous; and they reflect the intention of the parties that the tenant assume
    the risk for any losses caused by the tenant’s negligence.  Indeed, the clause on repairs expressly takes
    priority over other provisions in the lease and calls upon the tenant to pay
    the landlord for damages to the premises caused “though the negligence,
    carelessness or misuse” of the tenant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge in this case held that the clause in
    Schedule B of the Offer to Lease, requiring the Tenant to conduct its business
    in a good and lawful manner and to be responsible for any necessary repairs, was
    sufficiently similar to the repair provision in the <i>Lee-Mar</i> lease “to bring it squarely within the reasoning of <i>Lee-Mar.</i>”  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the repair provision in the <i>Lee-Mar</i> lease is comprehensive in
    scope.  The tenant must pay the cost of
    any damage or repair to any part of the building caused by its negligence.  This obligation is coupled with the tenant’s
    obligation to maintain insurance coverage against property damage to the
    building.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast, the clause in the Offer to Lease is narrow.  It merely obliges the Tenant to be
    responsible for the repair and upkeep of its own unit.  And, as <span class=SpellE>Charron</span> J.A. observed at p. 637 in <i>Tony and Jim’s
    Holdings Ltd. v. Silva</i>,<i> </i>where a
    tenant covenants to pay for insurance, the risk of loss by fire passes to the
    landlord, despite the tenant’s general covenant to repair.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Offer to Lease does not contain a
    covenant requiring the Tenant to insure the building against property damage.  Nor could it.  As the Tenant leases only one of the units in the building, it has no
    insurable interest in the rest of the building.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of <span class=GramE>these significant
    difference</span> between the lease in <i>Lee-Mar</i> and the Offer to Lease, the reasoning and decision in <i>Lee-Mar</i> provide no support for the Landlord’s position. </p>

lang=EN-US>The clause requiring the Tenant to
    maintain commercial liability insurance does not support the Landlord’s
    position</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge held that the clause in Schedule A of the Offer to Lease requiring
    the Tenant to maintain commercial liability (including fire and premises) insurance
    “lends weight to the landlord’s position”.  I do not agree with that holding.  This clause obligates the Tenant to obtain third party liability
    insurance.  So, if a third party sustains
    damage – including damage from fire – because of the Tenant’s negligence, the
    Tenant bears the risk of that loss.  This
    has nothing to do with the issue on appeal: who bears the risk of first party
    property damage.  The Alberta Court of
    Appeal explained this distinction in <i>Alberta
    Importers and Distributors</i> at para. 15:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Second, the Appellant misapprehends the nature and
    purpose of general liability insurance as opposed to property insurance.  The former covers claims by third parties and
    benefits the landlord.  If the tenant’s
    negligence injures a third party, the tenant’s liability insurance indemnifies
    the landlord against such claims which the property insurance would not
    cover.  The policy also protects the
    landlord against claims for joint and several <span class=GramE>liability</span> and protects against an insolvent tenant.  The tenant’s obligation to acquire liability insurance is, in our
    opinion, compatible with the landlord’s express and implied covenant to acquire
    property insurance and does not shift liability for damage by fire from the
    landlord to the tenant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in my view, the Tenant’s covenant to
    maintain commercial liability insurance lends no weight to the Landlord’s
    position.</p>
