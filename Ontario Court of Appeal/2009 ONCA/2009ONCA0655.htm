  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent recovered judgment against
    the appellants on an Indemnity Agreement, and the collateral mortgages securing
    the indemnity. The issues at trial and on appeal relate to (1) the date when
    the causes of action on the indemnity and the mortgages arose for the purpose
    of determining whether the claims are statute-barred; (2) whether the indemnity
    is a “specialty” within the meaning of s. 45(1)(b) of the former <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, and
    therefore subject to a 20-year limitation; and (3) if the claims are not
    barred, the applicable rate of interest on the claims. The appellant also
    raises the issue as to whether the reasons of the trial judge are sufficient
    for appellate review.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 1989, Rebanta Holdings Inc. as principal, the
    Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada (“MICC”) as surety, and the Toronto-Dominion
    Bank (“TD Bank”) as obligee, entered into a Surety Guarantee Bond for two years
    in respect of a $4 million credit facility granted by the TD Bank to Rebanta.  Under this Bond, MICC agreed to pay the TD
    Bank if Rebanta defaulted on its loan. The Bond was later extended beyond the
    two years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 1989, the appellants entered into an Indemnity
    Agreement under seal with MICC, agreeing to indemnify MICC in the event it was
    called upon to pay under the Bond. The appellants also gave MICC three demand mortgages
    on certain Muskoka properties, each in the amount of $825,000 with interest at
    18 per cent per annum.  These mortgages were
    stated to be collateral security to the Indemnity Agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By letter dated October 16, 1992, the TD Bank made demand
    on MICC under the Bond for the amount of $2,806,182.34, based on the default of
    Rebanta. However, in subsequent correspondence dated December 8, 1992, MICC
    delivered $3 million in T-Bills to its lawyers to hold until April 30, 1993.  The T-Bills were to be delivered to the TD Bank
    on that date, to the extent that Rebanta had not yet paid what it owed to the
    TD Bank by that time. This arrangement was agreed to by the TD Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 30, 1993, MICC paid the TD Bank by cheque the
    sum of $2,637,220.01, the amount outstanding on that date, and obtained release
    of its T-Bills. MICC received $488,714.50 on May 7, 1993, from or on behalf of
    Rebanta, but nothing further after that. For reasons not explained in the
    record, no action was taken by MICC to recover under the Indemnity Agreement or
    to enforce the collateral mortgages until June 2002, when Power of Sale Notices <span class=GramE>were</span> issued on the mortgages. On April 25, 2003, MICC
    issued the Statement of Claim in this proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a two-day trial in Hamilton in November 2007,
    in brief reasons dated February 19, 2008, the trial judge awarded judgment to
    the respondent on the Indemnity Agreement with interest at 4 per cent from
    January 1, 1994.  He also awarded
    judgment on the covenants in the mortgages with interest at 18 per cent,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and made an order for possession of the mortgaged properties. He found that the
    Indemnity Agreement was a specialty under the former <i>Limitations Act</i> and therefore the 20-year limitation period in s.
    45(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) applied. He further found that a letter dated
    May 10, 2002, sent from MICC’s solicitors in the matter to Mr. Jordan Grant,
    constituted a demand on the demand mortgages and, on the basis of the decision of
    this court in <i>Saved by Technology Rentals
    Inc. v. Thomas</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.), the ten-year limitation
    period under the former <i>Limitations Act </i>began
    to run from that date, making the claim on the collateral mortgages fall well
    within the limitation period. </p>
  <h3>Issues</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise six alleged errors by the trial
    judge: </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (1)       The
    reasons for judgment are inadequate for judicial review.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (2)       The
    trial judge erred in finding that the Indemnity Agreement is a specialty with a
    limitation period of 20 years. He should have found that the Indemnity
    Agreement is a simple contract subject to a limitation period of six years, and
    that the claims under the Indemnity Agreement were therefore statute-barred.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(3)       As
    mortgages “payable on demand”, the applicable ten-year limitation period under
    the former <i>Limitations Act<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></b></span></span></a> </i>began to run from the date the mortgages were executed, and expired before
    the claim was issued. In the alternative, if a demand was required to trigger
    the running of the limitation period, the trial judge erred by finding that the
    letter of May 10, 2002, constituted a demand under the mortgages. Instead, the
    trial judge should have found that the mortgages became due and owing in
    October 1992, when the TD Bank made demand on MICC under the Bond.  As the Statement of Claim was not issued
    until April 25, 2003, the claims under the mortgages are also statute-barred. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>  (4)     The trial judge erred by disallowing
    evidence of Mr. Biderman, the lawyer for MICC on the mortgages, to show that
    the 18% interest rate contained in the mortgages should have been the same rate
    as in the Indemnity Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(5)       The
    Notices of Sale under mortgage, although issued within ten years, are void
    because they claim interest at 18 per cent.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(6)       By
    the terms of the Indemnity Agreement, interest only runs following demand. As
    there was no demand made under the Indemnity except by the Statement of Claim,
    no interest runs before that date. </p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Are
    the Reasons for Judgment Inadequate for Appellate Review?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the reasons for judgment in
    this case are brief and conclusory. It would have been helpful had the trial
    judge set out his analysis in more detail. However, the trial was a short one,
    the main issues were legal rather than factual and written argument was
    submitted on behalf of both parties. In those circumstances, the brevity of the
    reasons has not so significantly impaired appellate review on the issues <span
class=GramE>raised</span> that I find the reasons to be inadequate.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Is
    the Indemnity Agreement a specialty within the meaning of s. 45(1<span

    action on a “simple contract or debt grounded upon any lending or contract
    without specialty” is six years.<a href="#_ftn3"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of what is a specialty for limitations
    purposes was considered in <i>872899 Ontario
    Inc. v. Iacovoni</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 715 (C.A.), where this court had to
    decide whether an agreement of purchase and sale executed under seal was a
    specialty. The case failed on the facts because the parties had not actually
    affixed their seals. However, the court stated that not every contract under
    seal is a specialty; the contract must also secure a debt obligation. Further,
    as later noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Friedmann Equity Developments Inc. v. Final Note Ltd</i>., [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 842, at common law, the creation of a specialty depends on whether the
    parties intended to create an instrument under seal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The New Brunswick Court of Appeal recently conducted an
    extensive examination of the issue of what is a specialty in <i>Kenmont Management Inc. v. Saint John Port
    Authority</i> (2002), 210 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 676 (N.B.C.A.). The majority
    decision found that for limitations purposes, a specialty is akin to a bond and
    means a specialty debt. The court examined the wording of the New Brunswick limitations
    statute which provides a 20-year limitation period for an action on a “recognizance,
    bond, or other specialty”, as well as the former Ontario Limitations Act, which
    refers to a “bond, or other specialty, except upon a covenant contained in an
    indenture of mortgage”.  The court noted that
    a specialty is described as akin to a bond, a recognizance and a mortgage
    covenant, and agreed with recent case law which holds that a specialty is a
    specialty debt or a covenant that secures a debt (see <i>South-West Oxford (Township) v. Bailak</i> (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 360 (Ont.
    Ct. Gen. Div.), at p. 369; <i>Suburban
    Construction Ltd. v. Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Housing Corp</i> (1987), 38
    D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 150 (Nfld. C.A.), at p. 152).</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            Application
    to the Indemnity Agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the Indemnity Agreement is
    not a specialty because when it was executed there was no debt, as no money had
    been advanced by MICC to the TD Bank. This argument cannot succeed. The
    appellants rely on the following <i>obiter </i>statement
    made by Cumming J. in <i>Camrost York
    Development Corp. v. Copthorne Holding Ltd. </i>(2002), 14 C.L.R. (3d) 210
    (Ont. S.C.), at para. 28: “it is arguable that to constitute a specialty, the
    obligation under seal pertains to a debt created <i>through the advancement of money</i>.” [Emphasis added.] This statement
    does not imply, as argued by the appellants, that the money must be advanced at
    the time the documents are entered into. As Robertson J.A. stated in <i>Kenmont Management</i>, at para. 56, a typical
    bond that is a specialty evidences a present <i>or future</i> debt. The same is true for a mortgage, which often
    secures future advances. The money does not have to be advanced at the time of
    execution for a bond, mortgage or other debt obligation to qualify as a
    specialty, when made under seal with the intent to create a specialty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the sentence that follows in <i>Camrost </i>clarifies that the comparison
    being made by Cumming J. is between a specialty and a simple contract: “[t]he
    mere non-performance of any contractual obligation giving rise to an action for
    breach of contract under seal [does] not suffice to result in an action upon a ‘specialty’.”<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is also no error by the trial judge in concluding
    that the Indemnity Agreement was intended to be executed under seal. The
    personal indemnitor, Jack Grant, signed together with a personal seal, and the
    corporate parties with their corporate seals. There is a recital that the
    document is signed, sealed and delivered. It secures a potential future debt. There
    was no evidence to suggest that the intentions of the parties were other than
    can be discerned from the documents.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge therefore made no error in concluding
    that the Indemnity Agreement was a specialty and that the 20-year limitation
    period under the former <i>Limitations Act</i> applied.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Was
    the action commenced within the ten-year limitation for the enforcement of
    mortgages?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three mortgages that are the subject of this action

    an interest rate of 18 per cent per annum. Also in each case, Box 9(c), “Calculation

    Indemnity Agreement and each provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THIS charge is given as collateral security for the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that because the mortgages are
    demand mortgages, the respondent’s cause of action on the mortgages arose on
    the date they were executed: June 1989. In the alternative, they argue that the
    cause of action arose in October 1992, when the TD Bank made demand on the
    respondent, MICC, for payment under the Bond, and expired ten years later. In
    either event, the 10-year limitation period would have expired prior to April,
    2003 when the statement of claim was issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law with respect to the date a right of action
    accrues on a demand mortgage is governed by the following principle: the cause
    of action accrues upon execution of the demand mortgage (<i>Alter v. Csontos</i> (2004), 26 R.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 103 (Ont.
    S.C.), at para. 34, (appeal dismissed as abandoned 2006 CanLII 6191 (ON C.A.))
    However, there are exceptions to this rule depending on the circumstances and
    the specific terms of the mortgage. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An example of an exception where the cause of action
    did not accrue before demand was made was <i>Saved
    by <span class=GramE>Technology<span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></span></i> the case relied on by the trial judge. In that case, the mortgage provided for
    no payment of principal or interest for at least ten years. After ten years,
    the mortgagee was entitled to obtain an appraisal of the property, and depending
    on the value at that time, the principal became payable. The mortgage did not
    provide for the payment of any interest. After ten years the mortgagee obtained
    the appraisal and demanded payment of the principal. The mortgagor, in
    response, commenced an action for extinguishment of the mortgage on the basis
    that enforcement was statute-barred by virtue of the ten-year limitation period
    under the former <i>Limitations Act</i>. The
    Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge that, in the circumstances,
    the cause of action did not accrue on execution because no monies <span
class=GramE>were owing</span> at that time or within the following ten years.
    The court observed that it would be absurd to find that the limitation period
    had passed before the mortgagee had any right to enforce the mortgage. The
    court held that the cause of action accrued on default, which occurred when no
    payment was made after the mortgagee made demand following the appraisal.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another exception to the rule that the cause of action
    on a demand mortgage accrues from the date of execution arises where the
    mortgage is a collateral mortgage. The stated rule in the case of a collateral
    mortgage is that the cause of action accrues on demand. The rule arises from a
    decision of Chitty J., sitting in the Chancery Division in the case of <i>In re Brown’s Estate</i>, [1893] 2 Ch. 300,
    where the court said at 304-305:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t is plain that a distinction has been taken and
    maintained in law, the result of which is, that where there is a present debt
    and a promise to pay on demand, the demand is not considered to be a condition
    precedent to the bringing of the action. But it is otherwise on a promise to
    pay a collateral sum on request, for then the request ought to be made before
    action brought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the exception is broadly stated, from the
    facts of <i>Brown’s Estate</i>, the
    exception applies where the collateral mortgage is given by a third party who
    is guaranteeing the primary debt of another. In <i>Brown’s Estate</i> the son, Alfred Brown, granted a mortgage to Stephen
    Perry on certain property in consideration of a loan of £3000. His father, John
    Brown, joined in the covenant on the mortgage which provided that Alfred Brown
    and John Brown would: “on demand, pay unto the said Stephen Perry…the sum of £3000.”
    When John Brown died, the property was of sufficient value to cover the debt
    and no claim was made in the estate. However, some years later, the estate not
    having been distributed and the value of the mortgaged property having declined,
    Alfred was unable to repay the debt, and the mortgagee sought to claim against
    the estate. The issue was whether the action on the covenant of the mortgage
    was statute-barred. The court concluded that the action was not barred because
    the father was acting as a surety and demand was required in order to give the
    surety a reasonable amount of time to find the money to pay the debt. In those
    circumstances, the language of the covenant requiring a demand reflected the
    intentions of the parties.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, where collateral security is provided by a
    surety and is stated to be payable “on demand”, demand on the surety is
    required to trigger the obligation to perform and the resultant accrual of a
    cause of action against the surety. As explained by Gabriel Moss Q.C. and David
    Marks in <i>Rowlatt on Principal and Surety</i>,
    5<sup>th</sup> ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1999), at para. 4-108:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a surety … covenants or promises to pay the
    principal debt “on demand,” a demand must be made upon him before he can be
    sued. His obligation is to pay the collateral sum, and differs from a promise
    to pay on demand a present debt owing by the promisor. In the latter case an
    action can be brought at once without any other demand than the writ.
    [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same rationale does not apply, however, where
    collateral security is provided by principal debtors to secure their own debt.
    In that case, the collateral security is provided as a source of payment by the
    principal debtors of their debt, and there is no special need for demand under
    the collateral security as the principal debtors have full knowledge of, and
    control over, the status of their debt. Their obligation under the collateral
    security is to pay the present debt that they owe. Therefore no demand is
    required.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exception applying to a collateral mortgage given
    by a surety is consistent with the basic law respecting a demand guarantee
    given by a third party guaranteeing the debt of another. That law provides that
    where a demand is stated to be a condition precedent to the enforcement of a
    guarantee, there is no crystallized liability until demand is made on the
    guarantor and the limitation period does not commence until that time. (Kevin
    Patrick McGuinness, <i>the Law of Guarantee:
    a Treatise on Guarantee, Indemnity and the Standby Letter of Credit</i>, 2d ed.
    (Toronto: Carswell, 1996), at para. 6.26).<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on this court’s decision in <i>Saved by Technology</i>, the trial judge
    found that the limitation period on a demand mortgage does not run from the
    date when the mortgage was executed, but from the date of default following
    demand. He further found that in this case, demand was made by letter from the
    respondents’ solicitors to Mr. Jordan Grant, of Seaton Development Ltd., on May
    10, 2002, regarding MICC’s intent to enforce the mortgages. Consequently, the
    action on the mortgage covenants, commenced on April 25, 2003, was brought
    within the limitation period.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge was correct in concluding
    that the action to enforce the collateral mortgages was brought within the
    ten-year limitation period, but he erred in finding, based on <i>Saved by Technology</i>, that the cause of
    action on the collateral mortgages accrued when demand was made in May 2002.<i> </i>The mortgage in <i>Saved by Technology</i> was not a collateral mortgage given to secure a
    primary debt. It was a unique situation where, although money was advanced when
    the mortgage was executed, it was not payable until at least ten years later
    and only after an appraisal was obtained.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does the exception for collateral demand mortgages
    apply in this case, because the collateral mortgages are not given by sureties
    for the principal debtors, but by the principal debtors themselves as security
    for their own debt. Therefore, the normal rule for demand mortgages applies,
    subject to the circumstance of this case that no money was advanced on
    execution of the mortgages.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, unlike in <i>Alter </i>where the money was advanced on the execution of the
    mortgage, which had a five-year maturity date<i>,</i> no money was advanced until April 1993, when MICC paid the TD
    Bank. This payment triggered the debt obligation under the Indemnity Agreement.
    Since the mortgages were given as collateral security in respect of the
    indemnity obligation, the advance of moneys triggering the indemnity obligation
    also triggered the commencement of the limitation period under the mortgages. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue in the alternative, that their
    obligation under the Indemnity Agreement (and therefore under the mortgages as
    well) accrued in October 1992, when the TD Bank made demand on MICC to pay
    under its Bond, more than ten years before the Statement of Claim was issued.
    However, the respondent submits, and I agree, that on the record, although the
    TD Bank made a demand in October 1992, it then agreed to give Rebanta the
    opportunity until April 30, 1993, to make good its obligation to pay the TD Bank
    before requiring MICC to advance under its Bond. That forbearance meant that
    the limitation period did not commence under the Indemnity Agreement until
    April 30, 1993, when MICC sustained a loss by paying monies to the TD Bank
    under the Bond<i>.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, once the monies were advanced by MICC to
    the TD Bank, the indemnitors were indebted to MICC and immediately owed the
    money under the indemnity. Because the mortgages were collateral security given
    by the indemnitors in support of their indemnity obligations, the mortgages
    became enforceable at the same time. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the trial judge was correct in his
    finding that the action to enforce the mortgages, commenced on April 25, 2003,
    was brought within the ten-year limitation period. In my view, the limitation
    period began to run on April 30, 1993, when monies were advanced and became due
    and owing under the primary security, the Indemnity Agreement.<i></i></p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial judge err in ruling that Mr. Biderman, the solicitor for MICC who
    prepared the mortgages, could not testify regarding the intent of the parties
    as to the 18 per cent interest rate?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants called Mr. Ron Biderman to testify at
    the trial. He was the solicitor who acted for MICC in taking the collateral
    mortgage security from the appellants on the Muskoka properties. He prepared
    the mortgage documents. He was called to advise the court that it was he who
    decided to insert the 18 per cent interest figure in the mortgages and to
    explain what was intended by using the 18 per cent figure. Mr. Biderman’s testimony
    was objected to and the trial judge disallowed his evidence on the basis of
    solicitor-client privilege and relevance. Although Mr. Biderman began to
    explain the circumstances, the objection prevented him from completing his
    explanation. The appellants suggest in their factum that one may infer that Mr.
    Biderman would have said that the 18 per cent was intended to be a ceiling for
    the rate of interest which was meant to coincide with the rate under the Indemnity
    Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in
    disallowing this evidence. They say that where the mortgages are stated to be
    collateral security, securing the payment on the Indemnity Agreement, the
    interest rate on the mortgage should be the same as on the Indemnity Agreement.
    Because it was not in this case, the court required evidence to explain the
    discrepancy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This issue was discussed by Kennedy J. in <i>Royal Bank v. H. Handys Services Ltd</i>.
    (1985), 38 Man R. (2d) 57 (Q.B.) as follows at paras. 6 and 7:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff argues that the promissory note, and
    in particular the note dated August 24, 1978, did not represent the entire loan
    transaction, and as additional security it obtained a personal guarantee from
    the principals of the company. The guarantee introduced as evidence (Exhibit
    #5), and signed by Charles Handziuk, as was the note, refers to the principal
    sum of $95,600.00, <i>with interest from the
    date of demand for payment at the rate of the bank’s prime lending rate of
    interest, plus 2 1/2%</i>.  A definition
    of the words “prime lending rate” are found in clause 15 of the guarantee, and
    corresponds to the wording contained in the last promissory note signed by the
    defendant. The guarantee signed by Charles Handziuk on the same date that he
    signed the promissory note relating to the same transaction, gives rise to an
    ambiguity as to which rate of interest was being charged, permitting the
    admissibility of extrinsic or parol[e] evidence. The complete terms of the
    agreement are not embodied in the promissory notes. The plaintiff obtained
    collateral security in the form of guarantees and chattel mortgages, which on
    their face conflict with the face of the promissory notes, hence it is
    imperative to determine whether the writing contained in the promissory note
    constituted complete expression of the contractual arrangements between the
    parties. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that it is quite possible for
    both documents to bear different rates because there may be different risks
    involved, (i.e. the corporate covenant versus the personal covenant of the
    principal). While this may be the case in some instances, the evidence here
    does not support such a contention, on the contrary, I am led to believe that
    the guarantee was security for the principal loan and it was intended that it
    bear interest at the same rate as the note.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The resolution of what interest rate was to be
    applied to the promissory note can only <span class=GramE>be</span> properly
    ascertained by the introduction of extrinsic evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Indemnity Agreement provides for interest in para.
    19(d) as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any and all amounts which the Surety [MICC] is
    entitled to be paid under this Agreement shall bear interest, at the lowest
    annual rate of interest quoted by chartered banks to the most credit-worthy
    borrowers for prime business loans (as determined and published by the Bank of
    Canada) on the final Wednesday of the month preceding the month in which a
    demand for payment thereof is made calculated from the date such demand is made
    (or deemed to have been made) to the date of payment; the Surety’s claim for
    such interest shall not merge in any judgment against any of the undersigned,

    the carrying out of the Chargors obligations and liabilities pursuant to an
    Indemnity Agreement…” Since the mortgages are stated to be collateral security
    to secure the obligations under the Indemnity Agreement, there is a possible
    ambiguity in the potentially conflicting interest rates provided in the two
    securities for the following reason.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the collateral nature of the mortgages, if
    the amount of principal and interest owing under the Indemnity Agreement were
    paid by the indemnitors to MICC, they would be entitled to receive discharges
    of their collateral mortgages: <i>Re Wiggins
    Ltd.</i>, [1931] O.R. 337 (S.C. (A.D.)), at p. 342; varied, but not on this
    point in <i>Re Wiggins Limited, Ex parte Robertson</i>,
    [1932] 13 C.B.R. 443 (Ont. S.C. (C.A.)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principle is described by M.H. Ogilvie, <i>Canadian Banking Law</i>, 2d ed.
    (Scarborough: Thomson Canada, 1998) at 318-319, in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While the word “collateral” is frequently used to
    mean something of a secondary nature, in the context of banking law it is commonly
    used as an adjective with “security” meaning literally “situated at the side”
    or “parallel or additional” to the primary obligation. Collateral liability is
    an accessory liability as distinguished from the principal or original
    liability. The term has been said not to be a legal term, but rather a
    commercial term “of somewhat loose and vague import”.  Since a collateral security is one taken to
    secure the performance of an obligation, then upon the performance of the
    obligation the security should be surrendered or <span class=GramE>discharged.</span> [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the debt obligation by the indemnitors
    under the mortgages cannot exceed their obligation under the Indemnity
    Agreement, because by paying the amount owing under the indemnity, they would
    be entitled to a discharge of the mortgages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the 18 per cent interest rate in the
    mortgages, there is the potential for the mortgage debts to grow to become greater
    than the indemnity debt. Because of this possible ambiguity, it would have been
    helpful had the trial judge allowed the appellants to lead the evidence of Mr.
    Biderman to explain the intended legal effect of the 18 per cent interest rate
    in the mortgages. As Kennedy J. stated in <i>Royal
    Bank</i>, there may be a reason for the 18 per cent rate, for example, in
    respect of enforcement of the mortgages <i>vis-à-vis</i> subsequent encumbrances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Mr. Biderman did not testify, this court must
    give effect in the judgment to the principle discussed alone. The appellants
    signed the mortgages. The trial judge was entitled to conclude that there was
    no basis to amend the 18 per cent interest rate in the collateral mortgages
    that were signed by the parties. His error was in using that rate to increase
    the debt owing under the Indemnity Agreement. In my view, the correct remedy is
    to recalculate the amounts owing by the appellants such that the amount of the
    judgment on the mortgages does not exceed the amount owing under the primary
    obligation, the Indemnity Agreement. </p>
  <h3>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Were

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that if the 18 per cent interest
    rate on the mortgages was in error, then the notices of sale that claimed
    interest at the rate of 18 per cent per annum did not comply with s. 31(1) of
    the <i>Mortgages Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    M.40, and the Form referred to therein, which requires that the amount owing
    under the mortgage including interest be stated. As I have found that the trial
    judge did not err in finding that the 18 per cent figure in the mortgages should
    be given effect in accordance with the terms of the mortgages subject to the
    rule in <i>Re Wiggins Ltd.</i>  This submission must fail.<i></i></p>
  <h3>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge erred by
    awarding interest on the indemnity claim when no demand was made under the Indemnity
    Agreement to trigger the fixing of the interest rate under para. 19(d). Again,
    para. 19(d) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any and all amounts which the Surety is entitled to
    be paid under this Agreement shall bear interest, at the lowest annual rate of
    interest quoted by chartered banks to the most credit-worthy borrowers for

    final Wednesday of the month preceding the month in which a demand for payment
    thereof is made, calculated from the date such demand is made (or deemed to
    have been made) to the date of payment; the Surety’s claim for such interest
    shall not merge in any judgment against any of the undersigned, and any such

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this submission. The appellants
    conceded that no demand was required under the Indemnity Agreement (as per
    para. 14). The trial judge awarded interest on the indemnity debt at 4 per cent,
    which was the lowest rate requested by the appellants at trial. Demand was
    deemed to be made when monies were advanced. The trial judge accepted that
    interest would run from the date when monies first became due and owing under
    the indemnity: April 30, 1993 (although the calculation of prejudgment interest
    prepared by MICC, and accepted by the trial judge, commenced from January 1,
    1994). I see no error in his conclusion. I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge should have
    exercised his discretion to reduce the rate of interest under the mortgages in
    circumstances where the respondent did not seek to enforce its rights until shortly
    before the expiry of the ten-year limitation period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based not on discretion, but on the principles
    discussed above regarding collateral security, the trial judge erred by
    granting judgment on the mortgage covenants for an amount in excess of the
    indemnity debt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of awarding judgment on the Indemnity Agreement
    and on the mortgage covenants, the trial judge accepted the calculation by MICC,
    which divided the principal into two amounts, the amount owing under the
    indemnity minus $825,000, on which it ran interest at 4 per cent, and $825,000,
    the principal amount of the mortgage, on which it ran interest at 18 per cent. This
    was an error because it inflated the amount owing by the appellants on their
    indemnity. The latter calculation is relevant only with respect to enforcing
    the mortgage security by sale and determining how much of the proceeds of the
    sale can be applied to the primary indemnity debt. To the extent that there can
    be separate enforcement of the covenant in the mortgage, except for recovery of
    payments of taxes and other mortgage expenses, it must be limited to the amount
    of the primary debt including interest under the Indemnity Agreement.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also argue, as an overall submission,
    that this court should not enforce the claims on the Indemnity Agreement or the
    mortgages because they were brought after the passage of so much time, even if
    they were commenced within the applicable limitation periods. They argue that the
    court articulated its judicial approach to limitations in <i>Hare v. Hare</i> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 766 (C.A.), that lawsuits should
    be brought within a reasonable time. </p>

    is brought within the limitation period, the action is not barred and it is not
    for the court to disallow a claim simply because it is brought at the end of
    the limitation period. If the court perceives unfairness, it may address that
    issue in its award of costs.</p>
