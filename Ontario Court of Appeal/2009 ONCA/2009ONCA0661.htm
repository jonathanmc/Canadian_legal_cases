  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Crown appeal from a stay of proceedings for violation of the right
    to trial within a reasonable time, principally concerns two issues.  First, the
    characterization of delay following an adjournment because of lack of judicial
    resources.  Second, the characterization of delay following a Crown request for
    an adjournment because of the illness of a prosecution witness.  Stong J.
    considered that the entire delay resulting from the two adjournments was either
    institutional or Crown delay.  In the result, the total delay exceeded the guidelines
    suggested by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771.  The
    trial judge found that the respondent had suffered substantial prejudice and he
    therefore stayed the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal, lift the stay of
    proceedings and order that the trial proceed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Allegations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was charged with sexual assault, sexual exploitation and
    sexual interference.  The Crown alleges that the respondent sexually abused the
    daughter of his common law spouse over a 12 year period beginning when the
    child was six years of age and ending when she was about 18 years of age.  The
    abuse allegedly included digital penetration and occurred on a weekly basis.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Proceedings in the Ontario Court of Justice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was arrested on January 12, 2006 and released on bail on
    January 20.  The terms of release included conditions that he have no
    communication with his common law spouse or the complainant, and not be alone
    in the company of any child under the age of 16 except when in the company of
    an adult.  The order contained an exception to permit the respondent to
    continue visits with his teenaged daughter in accordance with a Family Court
    Order.  However, the respondent and his daughter mutually agreed to suspend those
    visits while the criminal charges were outstanding, in order to reduce the
    stress the situation was causing her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent elected trial by judge and jury.  In an effort to
    expedite the proceedings, the respondent agreed to forego a preliminary inquiry
    in favour of an examination for discovery of the complainant and her mother.  This
    examination took place on July 5, 2006 and the respondent was committed for
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, proceedings in the Ontario Court of Justice were completed in less
    than six months.  Of this time, approximately three months is attributable to
    institutional or Crown delay.  The balance is either defence delay or neutral,
    being attributed to intake time or the inherent time requirements of the case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Institutional/Crown delay in O.C.J.:      3
    months</b></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Proceedings in the Superior Court of Justice</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Time from committal to trial to first trial date:  July
    5, 2006 to February 5, 2007</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 6, 2006, the parties set a trial date for February 5,
    2007.  While this was essentially a two-witness case, being the complainant and
    her mother, the parties estimated that the trial would last 7 to 8 days.  The
    period from the committal for trial on July 5, 2006 to the first trial date of
    February 5, 2007 consists of two months attributed to intake or defence delay
    and five months of institutional delay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Institutional delay to first trial date:     5
    months</b></p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Adjournment of first trial date:  February 5, 2007 to
    March 19, 2007</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the parties set the first trial date, Crown counsel
    realized that she had a potential conflict on the selected date of February 5,
    2007.  The case was therefore returned to court on September 15, 2006 and a new
    trial date was set of March 19, 2007.  The Crown accepts that it bears
    responsibility for this period of delay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Crown
    delay - Adjournment of first trial date:  1.5 months</b></p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Adjournment of second trial date:  March 19, 2007 to
    October 29, 2007</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 19, 2007, counsel selected a jury.  However, the presiding
    judge then declared a mistrial because no judge was available to try the case. 
    Three jury trials had been set for the same time and there was only one judge
    available.  Crown counsel chose to proceed with another sexual assault case
    that had been adjourned once before.  The explanation for that choice is
    contained in an affidavit from an Assistant Crown Attorney:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he matter of [<i>R. v. H.</i>] was determined to
    be the priority matter.  The charges were sexual in nature.  The matter had
    been up for trial once before but adjourned at the request of defence because
    of a personal tragedy.  Of the matters listed, it was estimated to be the
    shortest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties attended on March 28, 2007 to select a new trial date.  They
    agreed on October 29, 2007 as the new trial date.  Crown counsel put on the
    record that the court and the Crown could have held the trial in June and July
    but that defence counsel was not available for those dates.  The first trial
    date offered was June 4, 2007.  No mention was made by either Crown counsel
    (not Mr. Scrutton), defence counsel (not Ms. Verner), or the court as to whether
    trial dates were available in August, September or early October.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge attributed all of the ensuing delay from March 19 to
    October 29, a period of about 7.5 months, to institutional delay.  This is the
    first matter of controversy between the parties.  The Crown submits that 2.5
    months are properly considered to be institutional delay, being the time from
    the March 19, 2007 trial date until June 4, 2007, the first trial date offered
    to the parties.  The balance of the time, 5 months, should be considered
    neutral.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the trial judge was right to attribute the
    entire delay to institutional delay.  Alternatively, the three-month period
    from July 30 to October 29, should also be considered institutional delay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>Summary of the controversy</u></b></p>

  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Adjournment of third trial date:  October 29, 2007 to
    June 23, 2008</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 24, 2007, a few days before the scheduled trial date, Crown
    counsel applied for an adjournment of the case.  The request for the
    adjournment was supported by a brief affidavit from an employee of the Victim
    Witness Assistance Programme who had been assisting the complainant and her
    mother in preparation for trial.  She stated that the complainant’s mother had
    been diagnosed with cancer on October 18, 2007 and was scheduled for surgery on
    October 26, 2007.  The complainant’s mother told the VWAP employee that the
    complainant “will be critical to her after-care both physically and
    emotionally”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In court, Crown counsel told the presiding judge, who happened to be Stong
    J., that the complainant’s mother was a necessary witness to place things in
    context.  Crown counsel stated that “without her, I’m not in a position to
    continue”.  Defence counsel stated that he was not consenting to the
    adjournment.  After the adjournment was granted, defence counsel said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I mean, given the circumstances, the adjournment
    was practically a foregone conclusion, so I don’t have much to say about that,
    but I’m certainly, certainly not in the position to consent.  I want – I’m
    putting it on the record that [the respondent] intends to exercise his 11(b)
    rights in respect of this.  This is actually the second trial date.  It wasn’t
    reached on the prior occasion because of a shortage of resources.  And here we
    are again, we’re going to be setting a third trial date.  So, I just want all
    that noted on the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel then proceeded to put on the record a series of trial
    dates that had been offered by the trial co-ordinator.  They were as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>January 14, 2008:              defence counsel
    not available</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>January 28, 2008:              neither counsel
    available</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>February 4, 2008:              defence counsel
    not available</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>February 19, 2008:            defence counsel not
    available</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>March

    jury trial to begin March 25 </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>April 21, 2008:                  defence counsel
    not available</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>May 20, 2008:                   defence counsel

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>June 2, 2008:                     defence
    counsel not available</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties finally settled on June 23, 2008 for trial.  The trial judge
    attributed the resulting delay of almost 8 months to institutional delay. 
    Counsel for the appellant submits that the period from October 29, 2007 to
    January 14, 2008 (the adjournment to the first available trial date) should be
    considered delay inherent in the trial process and the period from January 14,
    2008 to June 23, 2008 (when the defence was not available) should be considered
    neutral.  Counsel for the respondent agrees with the trial judge’s
    characterization.  Alternatively, she submits that some lesser period is
    properly considered institutional delay, in part, because of Crown counsel’s
    tactical decision to seek an adjournment rather than apply under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> to have the evidence of the complainant’s mother from the examination
    for discovery read in at the trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>Summary of the controversy</u></b></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the total delay from arrest on January 12, 2006 to the
    third trial date of June 23, 2008, was just over 30 months or 2.5 years.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The proceedings on the motion to stay proceedings </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent testified on the motion to stay proceedings.  That
    testimony concerned the inability of the respondent to see his biological daughter
    while the trial was pending, depression brought about by the charges, and
    events at his employment.  The respondent testified to circumstances that are characteristic
    of the consequences of delay.  As he said, his life had been on hold while he
    waited for the trial to begin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further matter of note is that the complainant’s mother would not have
    been able to testify at the trial even if it had proceeded on June 23, 2008 because
    of a development with her health.  Crown counsel indicated that she would be
    bringing an application under s. 715 to have the witness’s evidence at the
    examination for discovery read in.  Defence counsel submitted that Crown
    counsel should have applied on the prior occasion to have the evidence read in,
    rather than seek an adjournment.  He pointed out that back in October 2007, the
    Crown was on notice that the respondent was asserting his s. 11(b) rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made some comments that indicated it was far from
    certain that he would allow the Crown to proceed by way of s. 715.  He
    suggested that perhaps the s.&nbsp;715 issue should be resolved first.  Defence
    counsel indicated that he had not turned his mind to that issue.  The argument
    was then adjourned to the following day.  At that time, defence counsel
    indicated that there would be “some prejudice”, but nothing dramatic to the
    defence if the complainant’s mother’s evidence was read in.  It is unclear from
    the interchange between counsel and the trial judge whether defence counsel
    would oppose the s. 715 application if the case proceeded to trial.</p>
  <h3>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not need to summarize all of the trial judge’s reasons since I have
    already set out the main areas of controversy.  I will, however, refer to some
    important findings by the trial judge.  He held that the circumstances of the
    offences were uncomplicated.  He noted that the defence had always been ready
    for trial on the scheduled trial dates and had taken steps to expedite the
    matter, such as agreeing to an examination for discovery rather than a full
    preliminary inquiry.  He held that the reason the trial did not proceed on
    March 19, 2007 was not simply because of lack of institutional resources but
    the Crown’s decision to give priority to another case.  He considered that the
    Crown’s position that institutional delay stopped running after the first available
    trial date of June 4 was unreasonable.  As he said: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>Defence
    counsel cannot be required to hold the balance of their schedule in abeyance
    and abandon further commitments so as to be in a position to agree to a seven
    to eight day period of time offered by the court and agreeable to the
    prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Accordingly, the whole period of 7.5 months was attributed
    to institutional delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also faulted the Crown for not applying to read in the
    complainant’s mother’s evidence and proceeding with the trial on October 29,
    2007.  He characterized this as a tactical decision and held that this period
    “falls to the responsibility of the Crown by way of institutional delay”.  The
    trial judge therefore held that the institutional delay in the Superior Court
    of Justice was 21.5 months, which was more than double the <i>Morin</i> guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the respondent’s testimony and found that there
    was inherent and actual prejudice to his interests by reason of the delay.  The
    trial judge focused on the fact that the respondent was unable to see his biological
    daughter and that he lost some opportunities for advancement and greater
    remuneration at his employment.  The stigma attaching to the fact of being
    charged was exacerbated because the Children’s Aid Society told at least one of
    the respondent’s neighbours about the charges and warned the neighbour to keep
    his children away from the respondent.  The respondent had to receive
    counselling and anti-depression drugs to deal with the stress.  He was also
    prejudiced financially because of increased legal fees to the point where he
    had to re-mortgage his home.  As well, because of his financial difficulties,
    the respondent had been unable to provide financial support to his family in Iraq.  This too was a significant source of stress for him.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper attribution of the delay following the two adjournments in
    March and October 2007 are the principal issues in this case.  However, the appellant
    has raised some other issues that I will deal with briefly.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Did the Trial Judge Properly Understand the <i>Morin</i> Guidelines?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge did not properly
    consider the application of the <i>Morin</i> guidelines.  The suggested <i>Morin </i>guidelines for reasonable institutional delay for a normal case proceeding
    through the provincial court to the superior court are to be considered on top
    of the neutral intake periods of delay at both levels of court.  The <i>Morin</i> guidelines for institutional delay are 8 to 10 months in the provincial court
    and 6 to 8 months in the superior court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to take
    into account the neutral intake periods in both the Ontario Court of Justice
    and the Superior Court of Justice and erred in attributing those periods to
    institutional delay.  While some of the trial judge’s reasons can admit of this
    interpretation, when the reasons are read as a whole, in my view it is apparent
    that the trial judge was alive to the difference between institutional delay
    and intake delay.  This is manifest from his statement that the period of
    September 6, 2006 to June 23, 2008 was institutional delay.  He has obviously
    excluded, as neutral intake period, the time from the committal for trial on
    July 5, 2006 to September 6, 2006 when the parties set the first trial date.  I
    would not give effect to this argument.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Did the Trial Judge Understand the Need to Consider the
    Societal Interest?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider the
    societal interest in proceeding with the prosecution and failed to balance that
    interest against the prejudice to the respondent.  The trial judge referred to
    the societal interest in proceeding with the trial at two places in his
    reasons.  He also had the benefit of submissions from counsel who both referred
    to the need to balance the societal interest with prejudice, even though their
    submissions on that aspect of the case were relatively brief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that as the trial judge calculated the institutional
    delay, he was faced with an institutional delay of over 21 months in the
    Superior Court where he had found actual prejudice to an accused who was
    anxious to proceed to trial.  I would not interfere with the trial judge’s
    decision, if he properly characterized the institutional delay following the last
    two adjournments.  The question is whether the trial judge did properly
    characterize the delay following the last two adjournments.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Delay Following the Mistrial Due to Lack of
    Institutional Resources</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the delay from March 19 to October 29, 2007.  In my view,
    the trial judge erred in characterizing all of this period as institutional
    delay.  There is no doubt that some of the delay is institutional delay; the
    system was not able to accommodate the respondent’s trial because of a lack of
    judicial resources.  I do not agree that any of this delay should be considered
    Crown delay simply because the Crown decided to give priority to another
    serious case.  The Crown had to make a decision.  There were three matters set
    for trial and only one judge.  The resulting delay cannot be said to be the
    result of actions by the Crown, unless it could be said that Crown counsel’s
    decision was unreasonable or capricious.  The trial judge made no such
    finding.  Accordingly, in my view he erred in holding that the delay was the
    result of the decision of the Crown to give priority to another serious case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of how to characterize the resulting delay is a difficult
    one.  It seems to me that in principle, since the mistrial was caused by a
    systemic failure, the delay until the system is able to again accommodate the
    trial is properly characterized as institutional delay.  Thus, from March 19,
    2007 until June 4, 2007 at least, is institutional delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant’s counsel submits that the balance of the delay of 5 months
    should be considered neutral.  He accepts that defence counsel could not be
    expected to hold his calendar open in the expectation that a trial will not
    proceed.  Thus, the delay cannot be considered defence delay.  However, he
    submits that equally, the system is not at fault; the system was ready to
    accommodate an earlier trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am very sympathetic to the position of both the respondent and his
    counsel.  They were ready and anxious to proceed to trial and through no fault
    of theirs the trial could not proceed.  Further, defence counsel should be able
    to organize their affairs in reliance on schedules set by the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the answer to this dilemma is to closely examine the
    reasons for the resulting delay.  In this case, the delay from June 4 to July
    31 is properly considered to be neutral.  The system was available to hear the
    case, but defence counsel, for perfectly valid reasons was not.  <span
style='line-height:200%'>  The reason for the delay from June 4 to July 31 was
    made clear on the record.  That delay was not waived but the result of
    unavailability of defence counsel, who had been prepared for trial on the
    original date but quite properly had scheduled other matters in the reasonable
    assumption that the respondent’s case would proceed as scheduled: see <i>R. v.
    Godin</i>, 2009 SCC 26, at para. 23.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different view of the period from July 31 to October 29, 2007. 
    With the exception of this period, on all other occasions when the matter had
    to be re-scheduled, Crown counsel took care to put on the record dates when the
    trial could be accommodated but defence counsel was not available.  However,
    during this period, neither Crown counsel nor the court made reference to any
    dates.  In my view, the record is reasonably open to the inference that the
    system was not able to accommodate this case from July 31 until October 29,
    2007.  Given that the initial reason for the delay was institutional delay, the
    evidentiary burden was on the state to show the system was able to accommodate
    this trial: see <i>Morin</i> at p. 788. Thus, this 3 month period must be
    characterized as institutional delay.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>Summary of period from March 19 to October
    29, 2007:</u></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Institutional delay: 5.5 months</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Neutral:                    2 months</b></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Delay Following the Adjournment due to the Illness of
    the Witness</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delay as a result of the illness of a witness is ordinarily attributed
    to the inherent time requirements of the case.  As Hill J. said in <i>R. v.
    Hoffner</i>, 2005 CanLII 32924 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 41:  “Such a contingency,
    while unfortunate and unexpected, is nevertheless an inherent feature of the
    litigation process.  In turn, therefore, reasonable delay to a new trial date
    is <i>prima facie</i> considered neutral.”  Hill J. went on to make the important
    point that not all the ensuing delay is necessarily neutral.  If the time to
    the next trial date is itself unreasonable, some portion of the delay is
    properly considered institutional delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read his reasons, the trial judge characterized the delay from
    October 29, 2007 to June 23, 2008 as institutional/Crown delay because of the
    tactical or strategic decision by Crown counsel not to proceed without the
    witness and rely upon an application under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to read in the witness’ testimony from the examination for discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent supports the trial judge’s approach and fairly makes the
    point that if delay following illness of a witness was always considered
    neutral, cases could drag on forever despite the mounting prejudice to the
    accused’s interest in a speedy trial.  In effect, the accused would be held
    hostage to the vagaries of the health of prosecution witnesses.  Further, there
    would be no incentive to the prosecution to seek alternative methods of proving
    the case, as was available here under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, as
    long as the institutional delay remained within the <i>Morin</i> guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While these are legitimate points, in my view, the submission fails to
    take into account the nature of the <i>Morin</i> guideline for institutional
    delay.  The periods referred to in <i>Morin</i> are guidelines not limitation
    periods or hard and fast rules.  As Sopinka J. said in <i>Morin</i> at p. 796: 
    “<span lang=EN-US>A guideline is not intended to be applied in a purely
    mechanical fashion. It must lend itself and yield to other factors.”  It is
    open to a court to find the delay to trial unreasonable even where the
    institutional delay falls within the <i>Morin</i> guidelines, especially where
    there is real prejudice to the accused:  <i>Morin</i> at p. 807.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s submission also fails to take into
    account other methods that the trial court has to protect the accused against
    unreasonable delay.  One obvious method that could have been employed in this
    case was for the presiding judge to refuse the Crown’s application for an
    adjournment if he considered the request inappropriate or infringing on the
    respondent’s constitutional rights. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it was unreasonable for the trial judge to
    attribute all the delay following October 29, 2007 to actions of the Crown or
    institutional delay.  The trial judge held that the Crown made a tactical
    decision to seek an adjournment rather than attempt to adduce the complainant’s
    mother’s evidence under s. 715.  However, the record does not bear out that
    view of the events.  The Crown application for the adjournment was heard on
    October 24 and was supported by an affidavit from an employee of the VWAP.  The
    effect of that affidavit was that </span>the complainant’s mother had been
    diagnosed with cancer only a few days before and was to have surgery three days
    before the date for the trial.  The complainant’s mother told the VWAP employee
    that the complainant “will be critical to her after-care both physically and
    emotionally”.  Thus, it was not just that the complainant’s mother was
    unavailable, but at least at the opening of the trial, it would be difficult
    for the complainant to testify.  I appreciate that the adjournment request was
    put on the basis of the mother’s unavailability, but it strikes me as
    inappropriate to force the complainant to testify in those circumstances. 
    Defence counsel made no attempt to pursue the issue or press for the trial to
    proceed despite the circumstances. Rather, he seemed to accept that the
    adjournment was inevitable.  I repeat what he said about the adjournment at the
    time:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I mean, given the circumstances, the adjournment
    was practically a foregone conclusion, so I don’t have much to say about that,
    but I’m certainly, certainly not in the position to consent.  I want – I’m
    putting it on the record that [the respondent] intends to exercise his 11(b)
    rights in respect of this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, the Crown’s decision to apply for an adjournment was
    reasonable and should not be characterized as a simple tactical decision. 
    Presumptively then, the resulting delay was neutral.  That is not to say that
    all the ensuing delay should be considered neutral.  Given the delay that had
    already occurred through no fault of the respondent, he was entitled to expect
    the system to respond with some urgency by offering dates for the trial as soon
    as reasonably possible.  He was entitled to have the system give his case
    priority.  My review of the record indicates that this is exactly what
    occurred.  The respondent was offered trial dates within less than three
    months.  That said, if there was evidence that the respondent’s counsel was
    available within an even shorter time, I might have considered some of that
    three months to be institutional delay.  However, there was no such evidence
    and no suggestion that defence counsel was able to accommodate an earlier trial
    date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It remains to consider the balance of the delay from January 14, 2008 to
    the selected trial date of June 23, 2008.  This is a very long period
    considering the delay that had already been occasioned in this case and
    requires special scrutiny.  Regrettably, there is not a great deal of
    information.  The court offered the respondent dates in every month between
    January and June.  Defence counsel declined each of those dates because of his
    other commitments.  He made no attempt to supplement the record by indicating
    that he was available at other times for this trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof was on the respondent to establish the violation of
    his rights:  see <i>Morin</i> at p. 788.  In the circumstances of this case,
    given that delay following an adjournment due to illness of a witness is <i>prima
    facie</i> neutral, it was for the respondent to show that the delay was
    unreasonable.  He could not do that simply by putting on the record that he was
    intending to exercise his s. 11(b) rights.  In my view, the trial judge erred
    in attributing the delay to Crown actions or institutional delay; while it was
    not waived by the defence, it should be considered neutral. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would summarize the causes of the delay in this case as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>Delay from January 12, 2006 to June 23, 2008</u></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Institutional delay:                         13.5
    months</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Crown delay:                                   1.5
    months</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Defence delay:                                 2
    months</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>Neutral, intake:                               13
    months</u></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Total:                                                 30
    months</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Morin</i> guideline for a relatively straight-forward case
    of this nature proceeding through the Ontario Court of Justice to the Superior
    Court of Justice for trial is 14 to 18 months:  <i>Morin </i>at p. 798; <i>R.
    v. Austin</i>, <span style='line-height:200%'>2009 ONCA 329</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>at para. 56.  Thus, properly
    viewed, the institutional delay in this case is below the <i>Morin</i> guidelines.  That does not end the inquiry.  The court must still examine the other
    factors that led to the total delay in deciding whether that delay was unreasonable. 
    In this case, an additional 1.5 months of the delay was caused by the first
    Crown adjournment request.  Thus, the total delay due to institutional and
    systemic factors and actions of the Crown is 15 months.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering whether the delay was unreasonable, regard must also be
    had to the prejudice to the respondent.  The trial judge found actual prejudice
    to the respondent’s security interests and I have not been persuaded that his
    findings in that regard were unreasonable.  To the contrary, there was abundant
    evidence of the toll the delay had taken on the respondent in terms of lack of
    access to his daughter, lost employment opportunities, increased legal fees and
    stigmatization.  Actual prejudice to the respondent’s security interests is an
    important factor in this case.  There was, however, no suggestion of prejudice
    to the respondent’s fair trial interests or his ability to make full answer and
    defence. Admittedly, the presence of that type of prejudice is not always
    required for a finding that section 11(b) has been violated: see <i>Godin</i> at para. 38. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The societal interest in pursuing this case to a trial on the merits was
    high.  These were serious allegations of sexual abuse against a vulnerable
    victim.  That interest has to be balanced against the prejudice to the
    respondent and his legitimate interest in a speedy trial.  This case is a close
    one.  The defence was the cause of only a very small amount of the delay,
    perhaps two months.  I am, however, satisfied that the delay was not unreasonable
    given that the Crown and institutional delay falls well within the <i>Morin</i> guidelines and that the longest period of neutral delay was the result of the
    illness of a Crown witness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Godin</i>, at para. 39, Cromwell J. speaking for the court,
    summarized his reasons for finding the same length of time to bring a similar
    case to trial to be unreasonable:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>This is
    not a complex case. A delay of 30 months in bringing it to trial is striking,
    given that <i>the delay was virtually entirely attributable to the Crown or
    institutional delay and was largely unexplained</i>. Critical evidence was
    disclosed some nine months after the tests which produced it, the appellant’s
    request for earlier dates was ignored, and when the case was clearly in s.
    11(b) trouble, the matter was not proceeded with on the date set for the
    long-awaited preliminary hearing. The length of the delay and the evidence
    supported the trial judge’s inference that some prejudice to the appellant
    resulted from the delay.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are some important distinguishing features in this case. First, this
    is not a case where “the delay was virtually entirely attributable to the Crown
    or institutional delay”. Second, the delay is not “largely unexplained”, and much
    of it is neutral. Finally, in this case, unlike <i>Godin</i>, there was no
    finding of actual prejudice to the respondent’s fair trial interests.  While the
    credibility of witnesses may well be a central issue in this case, it is
    difficult to see how, in the context of allegations of historic sexual assault
    occurring over a 12 year period, the delay, especially the delay occasioned by
    the last two adjournments, could significantly impact on this issue. </p>

    and order that the trial proceed.</p>
