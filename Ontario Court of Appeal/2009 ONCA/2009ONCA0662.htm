    medical doctor. In 2001, she had a dream of setting up a medical clinic that
    would focus on women’s issues and also provide cosmetic medical services. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Keeton's plans were relatively
    modest. By April 2002, she had purchased a small house zoned for medical
    offices in Hamilton, Ontario using $20,000 of a $50,000 small business start-up
    loan from the Hong Kong Bank of Canada (“HSBC”) as a down payment and by
    placing a $127,000 collateral mortgage on her home. Her business plan called
    for start-up expenditures of just over $50,000, including $6,450 for leasehold
    improvements; $23,000 for capital equipment (including $5,000 for computer
    software and $4,500 for office equipment) and $24,000 for annual cosmetic
    medical laser equipment rentals.</span></p>

    April 2002, she discussed her dream with Rocco DiBenedetto, a patient at the
    Oakville medical centre she was leaving. Mr. DiBenedetto had connections with
    an Italian Canadian Credit Union and claimed he could get her a better
    mortgage. </span></p>

    DiBenedetto spoke to Dr. Keeton about plans to obtain investors, franchise her
    clinic operation, and conduct training sessions for franchisees in the basement
    of her clinic. The appellant, Dynamic Medical Concepts Inc., was incorporated
    to operate the first clinic and to serve as a model for future clinics. </span></p>

    and sole shareholder of Dynamic; Mr. DiBenedetto and his business partner, Rose
    Ting, became officers and directors. The plan was for Dr. Keeton to focus on
    her medical practice, and for Mr. DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting to attend to the
    financial and business affairs of Dynamic. </span></p>

    was the intention of all parties that the first clinic would belong to Dr.
    Keeton alone. Mr. DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting were not to be shareholders, nor
    were they to be paid for any work they did in setting up the financial and
    business affairs of Dynamic. Rather, Mr. DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting stood to
    profit in the future, by setting up further clinics through a larger company
    using the first clinic as a model. However, it was the understanding of all
    parties that if Mr. DiBenedetto or Ms. Ting advanced any money to Dynamic, they
    were to be repaid.</span></p>

    DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting went to a branch of The Bank of Nova Scotia in
    Oakville to open a business account for Dynamic. Dr. Keeton signed various
    banking documents for Dynamic on that date, including a Scotiabank Financial
    Services Agreement Signature Form, a Banking Resolution, and a
    Certificate-Officers, Directors &amp; Signing Authorities form. </span></p>

    obtaining a line of credit for Dynamic by means of a government sponsored small
    business improvement loan. In July 2002, the Bank approved a $250,000 credit
    facility. The loan was to be repaid over a term of 60 months with interest at
    the Bank’s prime lending rate plus 2.5% per year. Commencing on September 22,
    2002, Dynamic was to make monthly payments of principal in the amount of
    $4,166.67, together with interest. Dr. Keeton signed a personal guarantee for
    25 per cent of the loan and provided a mortgage on the clinic as security for
    the guarantee. </span></p>

    Bank would advance approximately 90 per cent of the amount of an eligible
    invoice into Dynamic’s account and Dynamic was responsible for paying the
    balance from working capital. The loan approval crystallized after Mr.
    DiBenedetto provided $32,900.00 to Dr. Keeton for deposit into Dynamic’s account
    as working capital.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    and May 30, 2003, the Bank withdrew principal and interest payments from the
    account. Dr. Keeton called Mr. Sandell in May 2003 to find out why the Bank was
    deducting principal payments. Mr. Sandell apologized, claimed it was a clerical
    error and said he would ensure that such withdrawals would stop. In June 2003,
    the Bank debited interest only. However, in July, September and October 2003,
    the Bank again withdrew principal and interest payments.</span></p>

    was “more likely that these payments [were] the result of clerical error or a
    communications mix-up at the Bank of Nova Scotia” as opposed to fraud. Although
    he indicated that the deductions may have been the result of negligence he
    said, “I am not prepared to impute fraudulent intent to the Bank or its

    no evidence at trial capable of supporting the trial judge's conclusion that
    the principal and interest payments were deducted as a result of clerical

    submissions. In his conversation with Dr. Keeton, Mr. Sandell asserted that the
    initial improper withdrawals were the result of clerical error. Although this
    statement was not admissible to prove the truth of how the initial withdrawals
    came about, Mr. Sandell's assertion to Dr. Keeton that the payments were
    withdrawn through oversight and the subsequent correction of the amounts
    withdrawn provided an evidentiary basis for the trial judge to infer that all
    improper withdrawals were made through oversight. </span></p>

    for both principal and interest. Given that fact, it is understandable that a
    clerical error could be made if the employee requesting payment from HSBC
    overlooked the instructions to withdraw interest only. Particularly in light of
    the promise to correct the initial incorrect withdrawals and the subsequent
    correct withdrawals, it was not unreasonable to infer that the later incorrect
    withdrawals were also made as a result of clerical error rather than through
    deliberate conduct. </span></p>

    payments had to be calculated does not undermine the inference that principal
    was withdrawn as a result of clerical error. Moreover, any positions taken
    subsequently by counsel add nothing to the resolution of this issue. Given all
    of these factors, we did not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

    borrowing authority for Dynamic in order to cover up the Banks role in
    permitting the borrowing to take place. The trial judge rejected this
    assertion. He stated that the only evidence capable of supporting that

    Keeton's presence and that she initialled the changes. She did not have copies
    of the amended documents because the blank forms came in multi-copy sets and
    had already been taken apart when the amendments were made. The trial judge
    also noted that Dr. Keeton signed the documents relating to the $250,000 small

    However, they claim that the trial judge's findings are unreasonable in that

    Ting having authority to give instructions concerning Dynamic's account.
    Exhibit 6C contains a blank bank stamp whereas exhibit 6D does not. Exhibit 7C,

    have been multiple copies of the banking documents in the same form as those in
    Dr. Keeton's possession, the fact that a blank bank stamp appears on one copy
    of one of those documents, and the July attendance, do not fundamentally
    undermine the testimony of the Bank's witnesses to the effect that the banking
    documents were amended after the multi-copy sets were taken apart. It was open
    to the trial judge to reject Dr. Keeton's testimony given her admittedly poor
    memory of events and to accept the testimony of the Bank's witnesses. We see no

    invoice to Dynamic but rather agreed, at Mr. DiBenedetto’s request, to funnel a
    portion of its profits back to Dynamic as a means of cultivating future
    business with Dynamic. In order to do so, PrimeMed accepted and paid an invoice
    from Hartford in the amount of $19,388.40 for consulting services in relation
    to the sale of a vascular laser to Dynamic for $100,787.50 U.S. ($155,177.75

    that Dr. Keeton was not aware of any of the foregoing payments to Hartford by
    the suppliers. The payments were therefore secret commissions and the actions
    of Mr. DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting in arranging them amounted to a breach of their
    fiduciary duty as officers and directors of Dynamic for which they were
    accountable to Dynamic.</span></p>

    means of funnelling money to Dynamic, the trial judge found that Hartford, Mr.
    DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting were liable to account to Dynamic for these monies
    because they constituted trust funds. Finally, to the extent that Hartford, Mr.

    found that at least some of the monies that went to Hartford from the suppliers
    “were utilized for the purpose of repaying advances made by Ms. Ting and/or
    DiBenedetto.” He said, “To the extent that they can show that the monies went
    into Dynamic, their actions cannot be considered to be a fraud on Dynamic.” In
    addition, he stated, “To the extent of the money advanced from Hartford

    so that Dr. Keeton would not have to put her own money into Dynamic even though
    Mr. DiBenedetto represented to the Bank that the initial investment of $32,900
    was shareholders’ equity and not borrowed funds. Further, although the trial
    judge found that Dr. Keeton was not aware of any of the arrangements for
    “kickbacks”, he accepted Mr. DiBenedetto’s evidence that Dr. Keeton was aware
    that the advances for operating expenses were to be repaid by having suppliers
    put money into the company. In addition, the trial judge observed that there
    was some merit in the argument that had Dr. Keeton “lived up to her end of the
    concept” and “generated income into Dynamic, Dynamic would be alive and
    flourishing.”</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>DiBenedetto and Ting were left in charge of running
    the financial affairs of Dynamic and in the course of doing so, money from
    DiBenedetto was injected into the company. <i>To the extent that the money taken

    these advances, I find that there was no breach of trust involved and that
    DiBenedetto and Ting did not profit from their actions.</i> Their actions were
    of some benefit to Dr. Keeton, who was in fact the company, in that she was not
    required to inject further funds of her own into the companies to keep it
    going. In the result, I find that Dynamic's claim against DiBenedetto and Ting
    is limited to the difference between the amount of money which they put in,
    namely, $54,700.00, and the amount of money paid out to Hartford, namely
    $73,641.45, resulting in a loss to Dynamic of $18,941.45. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    trial judge erred in deducting $54,700 from the damages he awarded. In doing

    created, they caused Dynamic to borrow money from the Bank to both repay and
    partially replace the working capital of $32,900 that Mr. DiBenedetto had originally
    provided and also to pay themselves the $18,941.45 for which the trial judge

    should be repaid, she had been told that the funds for repayment would come
    from suppliers. She had not agreed to borrow money from the Bank to both repay
    and replace working capital or to pay Mr. DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting, and, in
    particular, she had not agreed to participate in a fraudulent scheme in order
    to do so.</span></p>

    not have the authority to borrow money from the Bank to repay themselves or to
    provide working capital; they did not have authority to borrow money based on
    fraudulent invoices; and, finally, having set up this fraudulent scheme, they
    did not have authority to use monies received from suppliers for Dynamic’s
    benefit to repay themselves for advances in priority to repaying money that
    Dynamic owed to the Bank.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    scheme, Dynamic was borrowing money from the Bank under the terms of a small
    business loan at Bank prime plus 2.5 per cent interest in order to pay approximately
    90 per cent of the amount of the suppliers’ invoices. Accordingly, to the
    extent that Mr. DiBenedetto and Ms. Ting arranged for inflated invoices to be
    submitted to the Bank, they caused Dynamic to borrow money unnecessarily and they
    did so based on fraudulent invoices. This conduct not only caused Dynamic to
    borrow money unnecessarily on the security of property and incur Bank interest
    charges unnecessarily, it also placed Dynamic in the position of having
    committed a fraud on the Bank.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

    no authority to divert funds in the fashion that they did. Moreover, they
    abused their positions with Dynamic to the detriment of Dynamic by wrongfully
    increasing the amount of its secured borrowings without authority and by
    incurring unauthorized interest charges to the Bank. In these circumstances,
    the trial judge was not entitled to effectively set-off any claims that Mr.
    DiBenedetto, Ms. Ting and Hartford had against Dynamic. Mr. DiBenedetto, Ms.
    Ting and Hartford were not entitled to be repaid the monies they advanced
    unless and until Dynamic was able to repay the Bank the monies that were
    borrowed improperly together with the interest thereon.</span></p>

    would vary the trial judge's award against Mr. DiBenedetto, Ms. Ting and
    Hartford to provide that they repay to Dynamic the sum of $73,641.45 received
    by them on account of secret commissions. Moreover, to at least partially account
    for the fact that Dynamic is required to repay the funds borrowed to pay the
    inflated invoices at the rate stipulated in the small business loan, I would
    order that interest accrue on $45,000 of that amount at the rate of Bank prime

    elements of both branches of the tort of conspiracy in the following terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the law concerning the scope of the tort
    of conspiracy is far from clear, I am of the opinion that whereas the law of
    tort does not permit an action against an individual defendant who has caused
    injury to the plaintiff, the law of torts does recognize a claim against them
    in combination as the tort of conspiracy if:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(1)&nbsp; whether the means used by the
    defendants are lawful or unlawful, the predominant purpose of the defendants'
    conduct is to cause injury to the plaintiff; or,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(2)&nbsp; where the conduct of the defendants
    is unlawful, the conduct is directed towards the plaintiff (alone or together
    with others), and the defendants should know in the circumstances that injury
    to the plaintiff is likely to and does result.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In situation (2) it is not necessary that the
    predominant purpose of the defendants' conduct be to cause injury to the
    plaintiff but, in the prevailing circumstances, it must be a constructive
    intent derived from the fact that the defendants should have known that injury
    to the plaintiff would ensue. In both situations, however, there must be actual
    damage suffered by the plaintiff.</p>

    Shiry believed that the purpose of submitting the inflated invoices was to
    funnel money to Dr. Keeton to reimburse her for monies she had already spent
    renovating the upstairs of the clinic and that Dynamic approved of the scheme.
    Although it is true that Mr. Shiry agreed to commit unlawful acts by submitting
    the inflated invoices, the trial judge’s findings negate the existence of
    either an intent to injure or a constructive intent to injure. </span></p>

    Shiry believed, in effect, that Dynamic owed the amount of the inflated
    invoices to Dr. Keeton and that by paying Hartford he was paying Dr. Keeton. These
    findings reveal an intent to assist Dynamic rather an intent to injure it.
    Moreover, they refute any suggestion that Mr. Shiry should have known injury to
    Dynamic was likely. Based on what Mr. Shiry had been told by a director of
    Dynamic, he thought Dynamic owed Dr. Keeton the money reflected in the inflated

    purposely exploitive conduct on the part of fiduciaries that occurred in this

    recovering money they advanced to Dynamic and perhaps also at compensating
    them, albeit without authority, for the time and effort they expended in trying
    to advance Dynamic’s interests. Further, in the trial judge’s view, Dr. Keeton
    was at least partially to blame for Dynamic’s failure. Accordingly, although I
