  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BluArc Communications seeks to set aside the orders of Kershman J. dated
    July 31, 2009, appointing PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as interim receiver of
    the assets of Natural Convergence Inc. (NCI) and authorizing the sale of those
    assets to Broadview Networks Inc.  The principal attack on appeal is with
    respect to the sale order and the vesting order that accompanied it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NCI develops software that enables its licensees, including Broadview
    and BluArc, to sell voice-over-internet protocol telephone services to
    customers.  Its financial position was perilous and beginning in early 2008, it
    commenced attempts to market its business or to secure new financing.  These
    efforts proved unsuccessful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, however, Broadview – the holder of 50% of its licences – came
    to its assistance.  It provided a certain amount of initial financial support
    to prop up NCI’s operations and then, on July 16, 2009, offered to purchase
    NCI’s assets through a Term Sheet that included a “no shop” clause.  Broadview
    says that its offer included a premium on the purchase price in exchange for
    that clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Broadview’s offer was accepted by the NCI board and supported by NCI’s
    secured creditors.  On July 31, 2009, Kershman J. was asked to appoint PwC as
    receiver and to authorize the sale.  At the time, BluArc and others were
    disclosed as parties who had contacted the receiver to express an interest in
    acquiring the assets.  The receiver was unable, however, to communicate with
    other interested parties because of the “no shop” clause in the sale
    agreement.  In its report to the court, the receiver indicated that it could
    not comment on the commercial reasonableness of the sale.  However, all of
    NCI’s secured creditors agreed to the sale, even though the proceeds would be
    less than NCI’s total indebtedness to those creditors.  BluArc was not given
    notice of these proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the orders were made and BluArc became aware of them, BluArc tendered
    what the receiver described as “a comparable” offer to purchase the assets and
    filed a notice of appeal from the orders of Justice Kershman.  This led to a
    motion by Broadview before Lang J.A. in this court seeking an order lifting the
    automatic stay imposed under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> R.S.C.
    1985 c. B-3.  On that motion, the reality put squarely to the Court was that if
    the stay were lifted, the transaction would be closed, notwithstanding the
    pending appeal.  Lang J.A. considered this fully and granted an order on
    September 2, 2009, lifting the stay.  She also expedited the appeal to today’s
    date.  The transaction was closed on September 3, 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although BluArc moved to set aside the order of Lang J.A., counsel did
    not pursue that motion in the circumstances.  Before us, it is argued that</p>
  <p>(a) BluArc does not have standing to appeal
    the orders of Kershman J;</p>
  <p>(b) the appeal should be dismissed as moot;
    and </p>
  <p>(c) the appeal should be dismissed on the
    merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Mr. Pasparakis, on behalf of BlueArc, makes the opposite
    arguments.  We find it necessary to deal only with the first of these, as in
    our view, BluArc does not have standing in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BluArc argues that it has standing on the basis that its relationship
    with the debtor NCI will be affected through the sale process.  Mr. Pasparakis
    submits that BluArc’s customer/licensee relationship with NCI will be affected
    because if NCI sells its assets, BluArc will not be able to receive the
    support, maintenance and upkeep services required to enable it to service its
    own customers with the licensed software product that is affecting its business. 
    BluArc is therefore not a “bitter bidder” or merely a creditor of the type that
    this court has said is not entitled to insert itself into receivership sale
    proceedings he argues.  See <i>Skyepharma PLC v. Hyal Pharmaceutical
    Corporation,</i> [2000] O.J. No. 467 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this argument.  In our view, the relationship of BluArc
    with NCI does not give rise to an interest that is sufficiently connected with
    the sale process so as to warrant standing in the sale proceedings.  BluArc
    does not have a legal or proprietary right in the property being sold.  It is
    not a creditor or, even at this stage, a contingent creditor.  To the extent it
    has an interest it is as licensee under its Master Licence Agreement.  Under
    that Agreement, however, BluArc chose to be protected in insolvency proceedings
    through the establishment of an escrow provision that entitles it to receive
    NCI’s source code and “all supporting information, tools, notes and other
    information necessary and sufficient to allow a reasonably qualified person to
    support and maintain the software.”  Thus, it has a remedy that will address
    the very critical interest that BluArc argues is in need of protection through
    the bidding process.  There is nothing in the expanded record on this appeal,
    or in the record that was before Kershman J., to indicate that this remedy is
    illusory.  BluArc is therefore not “a party with a direct interest in the
    proceeds of the sale” in the sense referred to by this court in <i>Skyepharma.</i> 
    As the Court said in that case at paras. 15-20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[15] There are two main
    reasons why an unsuccessful prospective purchaser does not have a right or
    interest that is affected by a sale approval order.  First, a prospective
    purchaser has no legal or proprietary right in the property being sold.  Offers
    are submitted in a process in which there is no requirement that a particular
    offer be accepted.  Orders appointing receivers commonly give the receiver a
    discretion as to which offers to accept and to recommend to the court for
    approval.  The duties of the receiver and the court are to ensure that the
    sales are in the best interests of those with an interest in the proceeds of
    the sale.  There is no right in a party who submits an offer to have the offer,
    even if the highest, accepted by either the receiver or the court:  <i>Crown
    Trust v. Rosenberg, supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[16] Moreover, the
    fundamental purpose of the sale approval motion is to consider the best
    interests of the parties with a direct interest in the proceeds of the sale,
    primarily the creditors.  The unsuccessful would be purchaser has no interest
    in this issue.  Indeed, the involvement of unsuccessful prospective purchasers
    could seriously distract from this fundamental purpose by including in the
    motion other issues with the potential for delay and additional expense.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[17] In making these
    comments, I recognize that a court conducting a sale approval motion is
    required to consider the integrity of the process by which the offers have been
    obtained and to consider whether there has been unfairness in the working out
    of that process.  <i>Crown Trust v. Rosenberg, supra</i>; <i>Royal Bank of
    Canada v. Soundair Corp</i>., (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).  The examination of
    the sale process will in normal circumstances be focussed on the integrity of
    that process from the perspective of those for whose benefit it has been
    conducted.  The inquiry into the integrity of the process may incidentally
    address the fairness of the process to prospective purchasers, but that in
    itself does not create a right or interest in a prospective purchaser that is
    affected by a sale approval order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[18] In <i>Soundair</i>,
    the unsuccessful would be purchaser was a party to the proceedings and the
    court considered the fairness of the sale process from its standpoint. 
    However, I do not think that the decision in <i>Soundair</i> conflicts with the
    position I have set out above for two reasons.  First, the issue of whether the
    prospective purchaser had a legal right or interest was not specifically
    addressed by the court.  Indeed, in describing the general principles that
    govern a sale approval motion, Galligan J.A., for the majority, adopted the
    approach in <i>Crown Trust v. Rosenberg</i>.  Under the heading “Consideration
    of the interests of all the parties”, he referred to the interests of the
    creditors, the debtor and a purchaser who has negotiated an agreement with the
    receiver.  He did not mention the interests of unsuccessful would be
    purchasers.  Second, the facts in <i>Soundair </i>were unusual.  The
    unsuccessful offeror was a company in which Air Canada had a substantial
    interest.  The order appointing the receiver specifically directed the receiver
    “to do all things necessary or desirable to complete a sale to Air Canada” and
    if a sale to Air Canada could not be completed to sell to another party. 
    Arguably, this provision in the order of the court created an interest in Air
    Canada which could be affected by the sale approval order and which entitled it
    to standing in the sale approval proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19] In limited
    circumstances, a prospective purchaser may become entitled to participate in a
    sale approval motion.  For that to happen, it must be shown that the
    prospective purchaser acquired a legal right or interest from the circumstances
    of a particular sale process and that the nature of the right or interest is
    such that it could be adversely affected by the approval order.  A commercial
    interest is not sufficient. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20] There is a sound policy reason for
    restricting, to the extent possible, the involvement of prospective purchasers
    in sale approval motions.  There is often a measure of urgency to complete
    court approved sales.  This case is a good example.  When unsuccessful
    purchasers become involved, there is a potential for greater delay and
    additional uncertainty.  This potential may, in some situations, create
    commercial leverage in the hands a disappointed would be purchaser which could
    be counterproductive to the best interests of those for whose benefit the sale
    is intended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we are of the view that BluArc does not have standing to
    bring the appeal.  The appeal is therefore quashed.  In view of this
    disposition, it is not necessary to deal with the argument that the appeal, for
    all practical and legal purposes, is moot, or to deal with the merits of the
    appeal.</p>
