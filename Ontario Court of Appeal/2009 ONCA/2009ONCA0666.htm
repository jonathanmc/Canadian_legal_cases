    theft, breach of probation and breach of recognizance.  He was sentenced to three
    and a half years for the break and enter; one year consecutive for the breach
    of probation; and one year, concurrent with the latter, for the breach of
    recognizance.  He was given ten months credit for eight and a half months of
    pre-trial custody, resulting in a global sentence of 44 months.</p>

    probation order that required him to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. 
    He was also subject to a recognizance that required him to remain in his

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The break and enter occurred on September 10, 2007 at an Etobicoke
    residence.  The owner and other residents of the house were not home at the
    time of the break-in.  The rear door of the house was damaged and the premises
    were ransacked.  Several items, including $2,500 USD, were taken from the
    house.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A postman noticed two people behaving suspiciously and called 911.  He provided
    descriptions of both suspects and specified that one of them was wearing a red
    hooded sweatshirt.  P.C. Walker and P.C. Barnes attended at the scene.  They gave
    chase but could not apprehend the suspects.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 13, 2007, the postman was shown a photo line-up.  He
    identified the appellant as the person wearing a red sweatshirt.  </p>

    identified the appellant in a photo line-up.  P.C. Barnes had earlier identified
    a person who was not a suspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) The trial judge erred in his charge to the jury
    by failing to emphasize the frailties of the identification evidence,
    especially as they related to the appellant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The trial judge erred by failing to permit
    defence counsel to cross-examine a police officer on the recommendations of The
    Hon. Peter deCarteret Cory in <i><span lang=EN-US>The Inquiry Regarding Thomas
    Sophonow:&nbsp; The Investigation, Prosecution and Consideration of Entitlement
    to Compensation </span></i><span lang=EN-US>(Winnipeg: Manitoba Justice, 2001) [<i>Sophonow</i> report]</span>; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The trial judge erred in his treatment of the
    evidence concerning a cell phone call made on the morning of the break and
    enter to the appellant's residence; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) The trial judge erred in failing to give two for
    one credit for the appellant’s pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the first ground of appeal, duty counsel submitted that the
    trial judge should have placed greater emphasis on the five-month delay in
    showing P.C. Walker the photo line-up.  Duty counsel also submitted that the
    appellant is the only person in the photo line-up with a significant bare patch
    in his eyebrow and the trial judge should have emphasized this in his charge to
    the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, a review of the charge to the jury on the weaknesses of eyewitness
    identification evidence, both generally and in the particular circumstances of
    this case, does not suggest reversible error.  Further, a review of the photo
    line-up reveals no unfairness to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the second ground of appeal, duty counsel submitted that
    the trial judge erred by refusing to permit cross-examination on the
    recommendations of Commissioner Cory in the <i>Sophonow </i>report.  Defence
    counsel wished to make the point that the photo line-up should have been
    videotaped.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, cross-examination on Commissioner Cory’s recommendations in
    the <i>Sophonow </i>report would have been acceptable.  However, defence
    counsel clearly made the desired point in his subsequent cross-examination.  We
    find no reversible error on the part of the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third ground of appeal concerns a cell phone call made to the
    appellant’s residence on the morning of the break and enter.  The relevant
    facts are as follows.  A second person, Mr. Antunes, was apprehended by the
    police near the scene of the break and enter.  He had in his possession a
    stolen cell phone.  The police investigation revealed that sometime between
    6:03 a.m. and 9:44 a.m., the cell phone was used to place a call to the appellant’s
    residence in Brampton.   It was the position of defence counsel that the call
    was made by Mr. Antunes, who was ultimately convicted of break and enter and had
    no reason to make the call if the appellant had participated in the offence.  In
    his charge to the jury, the trial judge reviewed the relevant evidence and advised
    the jury of the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There’s also an issue as to who placed the call. 
    The stolen cell phone was seized from Mr. Antunes.  There is no direct
    evidence, however, as to who made the call.  One inference is that Mr. Antunes
    made it, that would be because the cell phone was on his person.  It could have
    been made by someone else, even Mr. Alves or anyone else that the cell phone
    had been used by someone else, however, this is all speculation and as I said
    earlier you’re not to speculate.  You may or may not conclude that it would be
    speculative to conclude that the call on the stolen phone was made by Mr. Antunes
    to Mr. Alves at the time of the break-ins.  However, as I stated to you, it’s
    your view of the evidence that counts and you’re free to disregard what I say. 
    You are not free to, however, speculate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel objected to the charge on the basis that there was nothing
    speculative about finding that Mr. Antunes made the phone call; instead, it
    would be speculative to find that anyone else made the call.  In our view, the
    evidence went no further than to show that someone made a call on the stolen cell
    phone to the appellant’s residence in Brampton.  Duty counsel submitted that it
    was open to the jury to infer from this evidence that the appellant was at home
    in Brampton at the time of the offence.  To draw such an inference would be
    speculative.  We find no error in the trial judge’s charge to the jury on this
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the sentence appeal, the appellant submits that he was
    entitled to two-for-one credit for his pre-trial custody.  The trial judge
    considered this issue thoroughly.  He emphasized that the decision to give
    credit on a two for one basis was discretionary and not subject to a mechanical
    formula: see <i>R. v. Wust</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455.  Among the factors he
    considered was the absence of evidence that the appellant would have availed
    himself of any rehabilitative programs.  He noted that the offence took place less
    than two months after the appellant’s release from jail on several convictions
    for break and enter, and about one month after he entered into a recognizance
    requiring him to remain in his residence.  He also noted that the appellant’s
    pre-trial detention was of his own making; namely, the appellant had a history of
    disobeying court orders.    In the result, the trial judge gave the appellant
    ten months credit for eight and a half months pre-trial custody.  We see no
    error in the trial judge’s exercise of discretion in not giving two for one
    credit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal
    sentence is granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed. </p>
