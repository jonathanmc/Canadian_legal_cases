  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Johnson appeals from his convictions for possession of a loaded
    Smith and Wesson .44 calibre handgun without a valid licence, for careless
    storage of the firearm, and careless storage of ammunition.  He was acquitted
    of possession of a loaded restricted firearm and possession of a weapon for a
    purpose dangerous to the public peace.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal turns on the trial judge’s ruling that the gun was admissible
    into evidence.  The police discovered the weapon in the appellant’s pants
    pocket after the vehicle in which he was a passenger was stopped in what the
    officers maintained was a safety stop conducted under the provisions of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;H.8.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officers testified that they had initially become suspicious of the
    vehicle when they observed it parked in a way that “seemed out of place” on a
    residential court in a neighbourhood known for drugs and crime.  They were
    acting in an undercover capacity, assigned to the Street Gang Unit in Brampton
    at the time.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
    The car appeared to be occupied only by a female driver.  After observing the
    vehicle for about 30 minutes, at a distance of 30-50 metres, the officers saw
    the appellant get into the passenger side of the car.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The car left the area.  The police followed, falling in directly behind
    it.  A short while later, the officers noticed a small child “bouncing up and
    down” in the backseat, apparently not in a child car seat.  Shortly thereafter,
    the police stopped the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One police officer – Cst. Coniglione – approached the driver, Ms.
    Sylvester.  The other – Cst. Clement – walked to the passenger side and
    identified himself to the appellant.  This standard approach to a stopped
    vehicle is done for purposes of officer safety.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable Clement testified that the appellant did not acknowledge or
    respond at all, but kept staring straight ahead, breathing very heavily.  Constable
    Clement did not know why the appellant was reacting in such a nervous and
    anxious fashion.  He looked inside the vehicle and down the interior side of
    the passenger door between the door and the appellant<span lang=EN-US>’</span>s
    right thigh, but could not see the appellant’s right hand.  The appellant made
    no response to a question about his hand and Cst. Clement then opened the
    passenger door “so [he] could visually see his right hand.”  He saw “an obvious
    bulge in the right side of his pants” and noticed the appellant’s right hand
    touching his pocket area and cupped over something.  Concerned about the safety
    of the child, the driver and his partner, he asked the appellant to get out of
    the car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After emerging from the vehicle, the appellant attempted to move his hip
    area away from Cst. Clement and kept touching his pocket area, in spite of the
    officer’s request that he not do so.  Constable Clement then took the appellant
    to the police car and conducted a pat down search of his person, retrieving the
    gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant denied all of this.  He said that he was completely calm,
    had no idea why they were being stopped and that he and Ms. Sylvester, his then
    girlfriend, were shocked when it happened.  The appellant said that he was
    simply told to get out of the car and that the police officer grabbed his arm,
    pulled him over to the police cruiser, and conducted the search. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police asserted that the stop was conducted under the authority of
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> based on the suspected car seat infraction and
    to ensure the safety of the child.  The appellant contends that reliance on the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> was simply a ruse and that the stop was made for the
    purposes of a criminal investigation (unrelated to the subsequently discovered
    weapon).  Suffice to say that the trial judge rejected the appellant’s story,
    accepted the police version, and found that the stop was a legitimate use of
    police powers under the <i>Act</i> and not a “ruse or gimmick to facilitate a
    separate criminal investigation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Halfyard acknowledges that the police
    have the authority under s. 216(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> to stop a
    vehicle to conduct an investigation for a highway traffic infraction, such as a
    seatbelt violation.  The issue, he says, is whether the police used that
    authority for legitimate purposes in this case or whether they used it as a
    false justification or ruse to engage in an unconstitutional stop to allay
    their suspicions of criminal activity in what was acknowledged to be a high
    crime area.  He further acknowledges that the trial judge made findings
    directly against the appellant in this regard.  But he says that these findings
    were the product of palpable and overriding error because they were founded on
    a misapprehension of the evidence, they resulted from a failure to deal with
    material inconsistencies between the testimony of Constables Coniglione and
    Clement, and they were based on an uneven and unbalanced scrutiny of the
    evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the appellant’s submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave thorough reasons in his 36-page decision on the
    Charter motion.  He canvassed the evidence on the basis of the case as it was
    presented to him and concluded that <span lang=EN-US>“[o]n the evidence before
    [him he was] not satisfied that the initial stop by the officers was a ruse or
    a gimmick to facilitate a separate criminal investigation.”  The onus was on
    the appellant in this regard, and, on the evidence, this was the trial judge’s decision
    to make.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>We see no basis for the argument that the trial judge
    misapprehended any of the evidence in any material way, or for the submission
    that his findings were based on an unbalanced and uneven scrutiny of the
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In oral argument, Mr. Halfyard’s submissions concentrated
    principally on the contention that the trial judge had failed to deal with
    various inconsistencies between the testimony of Cst. Coniglione and that of
    Cst. Clement.  In particular, he focused on the fact that the trial judge did
    not specifically reconcile an alleged discrepancy regarding the evidence that
    the car’s windows were tinted, thus affecting the officers’ ability to observe
    what was happening inside it (specifically, whether the child was bouncing up
    and down out of the car seat).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge was alive to the fact that the car windows were
    tinted – he cites the appellant’s evidence to that effect – he did not address
    this issue directly in his reasons.  He did acknowledge the differences between
    the testimony of the police officers and reconciled them generally, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The officers’ evidence is not identical.  The
    versions have differences but neither officer exaggerated or embellished the
    situation.  Witnesses do see things different(ly).  Some of the details as to
    what happened are different.  The officers made different observations.  They
    saw things different[ly]. This does not result, in my view, in a finding that
    the basis for the stop is made up or a gimmick to stop the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While general statements in the reasons may not be a substitute for not
    addressing material inconsistencies – see <i>R. v. Gabris</i>, 2007 ONCA 437,
    for example – the reality is that, on this record, the testimony of the police
    officers on the tinted window issue was not materially inconsistent.  Constable
    Clement said that the car windows were tinted and that he could not see inside
    the car <i>when it was parked on the street and first observed from about 30-50
    metres</i>.  He did not say he could not see inside the vehicle because of the
    tinted windows (or at all) when they were following “directly behind” the
    vehicle at the time he observed the child bouncing up and down.  Constable
    Coniglione could not remember whether the car windows were tinted, but admitted
    they possibly could have been.  When they first observed the vehicle parked at
    the side of the road, he was able to see the female driver because the window
    was down.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not see any significant discrepancies in this evidence.  Neither
    police officer testified that – nor were they asked to clarify whether – the
    tinted windows were an impediment to their ability to see inside the car when
    they were following directly behind it and observed the child in the back seat just
    before the stop.  Again, the onus was on the appellant on this motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the fact that the discrepancies, if any, in this area of the
    testimony were minor, may explain why defence counsel at trial gave the matter
    very little play.  He identified five material inconsistencies, concerning</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) whether and how the child was bouncing in the
    back seat (Cst. Coniglione said he could just see the head and nothing below
    the head; Cst. Clement said he could see not only the head but the shoulders
    and chest area as well);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) where the pat search of the appellant actually
    occurred (Cst. Coniglione said at Ms. Sylvester’s car; Cst. Clement said at the
    police car);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) whether the officers made their notes
    independently of each other (the complaint really was that they had not made
    their notes independently and had consulted – the notes diverged somewhat);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv) whether the appellant was staring straight
    ahead while seated in the passenger seat (Cst. Clement said he was and that he
    was unresponsive; Cst. Coniglione said he saw them looking at each other); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v) Constable
    Coniglione’s unwillingness to corroborate Cst. Clement’s evidence regarding the
    appellant`s supposed panic attack (a weakness, not really an inconsistency).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of the foregoing, trial counsel identified the first – whether and how
    the child was bouncing in the back seat – as “<span lang=EN-US>the very and
    primary – the most important and significant contradiction between the officers”. 
    To make this “primary” argument, he needed to emphasize the police officers’
    ability to observe, as he did, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And how … could there
    be any difference in their evidence on this point?  They were sitting right
    next to each other.  <i>They were apparently right behind the car at the time
    they were making this pivotal, critical observation</i>.  How could there be
    any – any confusion or ambiguity between the two?  Either it was a clear
    violation or it wasn’t.  So, I would submit that when we have two people who
    are – <i>who have the exact same opportunity to observe the very same thing</i> and yet we’re getting different versions of that same thing, it – it should
    seriously call into question whether or not that observation was in fact made
    in my submission. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel’s primary argument, then, was not that the officers <i>could
    not</i> see what was happening inside the vehicle when they were following
    directly behind it, but rather that they <i>could</i>.  Their evidence should
    not have been different and was therefore unreliable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge specifically addressed and reconciled this different
    testimony, however.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At first the officers
    do not see the child in the vehicle.  As they follow the vehicle, the first
    time their police car is directly behind Ms. Sylvester’s vehicle is at Queen
    Street and Dixie.  It is at this time that they notice a child in the vehicle. 
    Cst. Coniglione testified that he only saw the child’s head bouncing up and
    down.  This differs from Cst. Clement’s evidence when he stated he saw the
    child from the mid-chest level to the shoulders and the head of the child
    moving about in the car.  I accept Cst. Clement’s observations as being more
    accurate as he was not driving the police cruiser and was able to focus on
    those observations more than Cst. Coniglione could, as he was driving.  Cst.
    Clement was in a better position than Cst. Coniglione to make those
    observations.  Cst. Coniglione was driving through an area of Queen Street that
    was undergoing construction and it was a busy time of the day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the trial judge dealt directly with the defence argument
    that if the appellant’s “panic” reaction had been so extreme, Cst. Coniglione
    would have noticed it.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that it
    was possible that Cst. Coniglione did not and could not make the same
    observations that Cst. Clement made of Johnson.  The evidence Darlene Sylvester
    is consistent with that.  Even though she was sitting beside Johnson, she
    testified that she could not hear what Cst. Clement or Johnson were saying. 
    Johnson also indicated that he never heard what Darlene and the officer were
    talking about or that they were even talking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other “material” inconsistencies relied on by the appellant are, in
    our view, either minor in nature or not inconsistencies at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of his submissions on this point, defence counsel at
    trial referred to the tinted window issue as one of a number of “extraneous factors”
    that he said would “tend to support the defence position that this particular
    observation was not observed”.  He acknowledged that the issue was “not a
    determinative factor”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the argument emphasized in oral argument on this appeal – that
    the police officers were not able to observe what was going on inside the
    vehicle because of the tinted windows – was only raised peripherally at trial
    and was not really an issue in play.  In the circumstances of this case, the
    trial judge’s general treatment of the differences between the officers’
    testimony – cited in para. 15 above – is adequate indication that he directed
    his mind to the resolution of such matters, in our view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike <i>Gabris</i>, this was not a case where there were numerous
    inconsistencies in the evidence and several key inconsistencies that were not
    resolved by the trial judge.  The trial judge here expressly addressed the two
    central inconsistencies raised by the defence – the discrepancies in the police
    officers’ testimony respecting the bouncing child in the back seat, and the
    defence argument that if the appellant was in the “panic” state described by
    Cst. Clement, Cst. Coniglione would have noticed.  He therefore complied with
    the observations of this court in <i>Gabris</i>, at para. 10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, trial
    judges are not required to deal expressly with every inconsistency in the
    evidence.  Trial judges should, however, address contradictory evidence on key
    or material points.  See <i>R. v. Stark</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 496 at
    paras. 12-13 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  There
    was ample basis in the record to support the trial judge’s finding that the
    incident relating to the child seat belt infraction was not fabricated, that
    the stop was justified under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, and that the stop
    for that purpose was not simply a pretext or ruse to cover for some other
    general criminal investigation.  In the absence of palpable and overriding
    error, there is no basis for us to interfere. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Fresh Evidence Application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sought leave to introduce fresh evidence in the form of
    photographs and a satellite Google map of the street on which the police
    officers first observed Ms. Sylvester’s vehicle parked.  The object of this
    proposed evidence is to demonstrate that the police officers’ evidence with
    respect to the vehicle’s location was inaccurate, thereby undermining their
    credibility and enhancing the appellant’s position that their story was
    fabricated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not admit the fresh evidence.  With the smallest degree of due
    diligence, it could easily have been adduced at trial, but, in any event, it is
    not clear from an examination of the photographs that they materially
    contradict the evidence of the police officers as to the location of the parked
    car.  In addition, the police officers’ evidence was consistent with that of
    Ms. Sylvester in this regard.  The evidence therefore fails to meet at least
    the first and fourth of the criteria established in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980]
    1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, namely that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) The evidence should
    generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial
    provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal
    case as in civil cases.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The evidence must
    be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive
    issue in the trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The evidence must
    be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief. [And]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) [The evidence]
    must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other
    evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result. [Citations
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, because of its equivocal nature, the proposed evidence could not
    reasonably be expected to have affected the result, in our view.  Moreover,
    although due diligence is less of a factor for consideration in criminal cases,
    the type of fresh evidence proposed could very easily have been – and should
    have been – tendered at trial had it been felt to be germane at the time.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application to admit fresh evidence is dismissed.  The appeal from
    conviction is also dismissed.</p>
