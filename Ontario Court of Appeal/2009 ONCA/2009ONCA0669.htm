  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Rule 13.02, the appellants unsuccessfully sought leave to
    intervene as a friend of the court in the application brought by the
    respondents Terri Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch and Valerie Scott.  That
    application seeks a declaration that certain sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> criminalizing activities related to prostitution violate the <i>Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant jurisprudence provides considerable guidance to a court
    hearing such a motion.  Where the intervention is in a <i>Charter</i> case,
    usually at least one of three criteria is met by the intervenor: it has a real
    substantial and identifiable interest in the subject matter of the proceedings;
    it has an important perspective distinct from the immediate parties; or it is a
    well recognized group with a special expertise and a broadly identifiable
    membership base.  See: <i>Ontario (Attorney General) v. Dieleman</i> (1993), 16
    O.R. (3d) 32.  Most importantly, the over-arching principle is that laid down
    by Dubin C.J.O. in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic and
    Pacific Co. of Canada </i>(1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 164 at 167:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although much has been written as to the proper
    matters to be considered in determining whether an application for intervention
    should be granted, in the end, in my opinion, the matters to be considered are
    the nature of the case, the issues which arise and the likelihood of the
    applicant being able to make a useful contribution to the resolution of the
    appeal without causing injustice to the immediate parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, while Rule 13.02 accords considerable deference to the court
    hearing the motion, that discretion is not immune from appellate scrutiny. 
    See:<i> GEA Group AG v. Ventra Group Co.</i> (2009), ONCA 619.  That discretion
    cannot be exercised for reasons that clearly misapprehend the record before the
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the record leaves no doubt that the appellants meet
    several of the <i>Dieleman </i>criteria.  They have a real substantial and
    identifiable interest in the subject matter of the application and, as
    acknowledged by the Attorney General of Canada, an important perspective
    different from the parties.  The respondents do not oppose the motion on this
    basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents’ argument at first instance was that the appellants did
    not show that they would be in a position to make a useful contribution to the resolution
    of any issue that needed to be determined.  In the end, the motion judge
    essentially agreed with this submission.  However, he did so for reasons that,
    in our view, are clearly erroneous.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that the appellants’ proposed argument was
    not described clearly, making it impossible to apply the test for
    intervention.  We disagree.  The record below and counsel’s submissions clearly
    described the appellants’ position, namely, that the constitutionality of the
    challenged laws can be supported by the moral values of Canadian society. 
    Indeed, before us, counsel for the respondents not only understood that this
    was their position but argued vigorously that it was irrelevant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also determined that, in any event, he could not
    reasonably determine whether any issues of morality would properly arise in the
    argument of the application.  That too misunderstands the material before him. 
    The respondents were clear both below and in this court that in the application
    they will argue that morality cannot serve to support the constitutionality of
    the impugned legislation.  In other words, the respondents will be putting that
    issue in play.  The Attorney General of Canada indicated it would not be
    relying on Canadian moral values as a cornerstone of its defence of the
    legislation but made clear that there was considerable affidavit evidence in
    the record relating to such an argument.  Whether the appellants’ position
    ultimately prevails or not, it will provide a counterpoint to the respondents’
    argument that will not otherwise be made and may be useful to the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the motion judge’s view that the appellants have not shown
    any special knowledge entitling them to advance their arguments overlooks that
    the appellants do not seek to file any affidavit material.  They seek only to
    make legal argument, not to supply the court with specialized knowledge,
    something that also provides a complete answer to the concern that their
    participation could disrupt the hearing.  Also, the time limited argument means
    that their participation would not unduly lengthen the hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the basis for the motion judge’s decision is clearly flawed
    and his conclusion therefore cannot stand.  Rather, as we have indicated, given
    the issues at stake and the position the appellants propose to take, we conclude
    that the appellants may be able to make a useful contribution to the
    application without causing injustice to the immediate parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would allow the appeal and grant the motion as asked, with the
    addition set out in para. 19 of the factum of the Attorney General of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No costs here or below.</p>
