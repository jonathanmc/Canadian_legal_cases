  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an administrative tribunal has a legal obligation to give reasons
    for its decision, on judicial review, what standard of review should the court
    apply in deciding whether it has done so?  And then how does the court assess
    whether the reasons the tribunal provides are adequate to meet that legal
    obligation?  Those are the principal questions raised by this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Divisional Court, by majority, assessed the reasons of
    the administrative tribunal against both a standard of reasonableness and the
    principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.  It found the reasons
    inadequate to meet the tribunal’s legal obligation.  It therefore granted the
    application for judicial review and quashed the decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.  In my view, the
    majority of the Divisional Court erred in applying the standard of
    reasonableness and in finding the reasons inadequate to meet the tribunal’s
    legal obligation.  I would apply the standard of correctness and conclude that
    the reasons given by the tribunal are adequate to meet its legal obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) is a pension
    benefit system that is primarily for employees of Ontario municipalities. The
    administrative tribunal under scrutiny here is its Appeal Sub-committee (the
    Tribunal). Both OMERS and the Tribunal are governed by the <i>Ontario Municipal
    Employees Retirement System Act, 2006</i>, S.O. 2006, c.2 and the <i>Pension
    Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8.  Determinations of entitlement to a
    pension benefit are made in the first instance by the president of OMERS. 
    Appeals from the president are heard by the Tribunal, a sub-committee of the
    OMERS Board, whose members typically consist either primarily or exclusively of
    non lawyers.  In this case, the Tribunal was comprised entirely of non-lawyers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts giving rise to the dispute in this case are not complicated. 
    Tony Clifford was a Toronto firefighter and a member of OMERS.  Sylvia Clifford
    and Tony Clifford were married in 1980.  They had two children.  They separated
    in 1996 and were legally divorced in January 2004.  Mr. Clifford died without a
    will on February 20, 2005.  Ms. Clifford is the named beneficiary under his OMERS
    pension plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1999, Mr. Clifford moved into Bernadette Campbell’s residence.  Ms.
    Campbell asserts that they lived together as common law partners until his
    death.  It is undisputed that if this was so, Ms. Campbell, rather than Ms.
    Clifford, is entitled to the surviving spousal benefit from Mr. Clifford’s
    OMERS pension.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After Mr. Clifford’s death, Ms. Campbell applied to OMERS for this
    benefit.  Ms. Clifford contested the application, saying that Ms. Campbell and
    Mr. Clifford were not common law spouses at the time of his death, and claiming
    the benefit for herself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first instance, the president of OMERS concluded that Ms. Campbell
    and Mr. Clifford were living in a common law relationship at the time of his
    death, and Ms. Campbell was therefore entitled to the surviving spousal benefit
    under his OMERS plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Clifford appealed to the Tribunal.  It conducted a hearing <i>de
    novo</i> into the matter.  Twelve witnesses were heard over two days of
    evidence.  Argument was received from counsel, and a full transcript of the
    hearing was produced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal reserved its decision for several weeks and issued a decision
    dismissing Ms. Clifford’s appeal.  It set out the two questions it had to
    decide under the OMERS plan and governing legislation: whether Ms. Campbell and
    Mr. Clifford were in a common law relationship for at least three years prior
    to his death; and whether this relationship was still in place at the time of
    his death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first question, it noted the uncontested evidence that Mr.
    Clifford moved into Ms. Campbell’s residence in 1999.  It then recited evidence
    supportive of Ms. Campbell’s claim that they lived together as common law
    partners, including evidence of many activities they engaged in together, and evidence
    of Ms. Campbell’s involvement in his funeral arrangements, being named in the
    notice in the newspaper and receiving a share of his ashes, and finally evidence
    from neighbours of their own observations of the couple.  On this basis, the Tribunal
    concluded that the necessary common law relationship was established.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal then considered the second question.  Mr. Clifford died in
    a motel while on a drinking binge.  There was evidence that he had battled a
    serious drinking problem for some time and would, on occasion, move to a motel when
    on a binge, always returning to take up residence with Ms. Campbell.  The
    Tribunal also referred to evidence from Mr. Clifford’s union representative
    that shortly before his death, Ms. Campbell told the representative that the
    relationship had essentially ended and Mr. Clifford no longer resided with
    her.  It also referred to Ms. Campbell’s denial of this and recited other
    evidence tending to support her, such as the continued presence of many of his
    personal belongings and important papers in the home.  The Tribunal concluded its
    decision this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]e are not persuaded that the conjugal
    relationship between Ms. Campbell and Mr. Clifford had terminated at the time
    of his death, and accordingly we dismiss the appeal of Ms. Clifford. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Clifford applied for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision.  Molloy
    J. for the majority of the Divisional Court concluded that the Tribunal was
    required to give reasons but had failed to adequately do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority found that the Tribunal may have improperly reversed the
    onus of proof when it stated it was not persuaded that the conjugal
    relationship between Mr. Clifford and Ms. Campbell had terminated at the time
    of his death, but in the absence of any reasons beyond this single sentence, it
    was impossible to say.  The majority also found that, despite hearing
    conflicting evidence on many points, the Tribunal made no findings of
    credibility or reliability and offered no reasons as to how its ultimate
    decision was reached.  Finally, the majority listed a number of pieces of
    evidence that it felt would have been relevant for the Tribunal to consider in
    deciding if a common law relationship existed and whether it had ended, but
    which the Tribunal did not refer to in its reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing the appropriate standard of review the majority noted that
    the Supreme Court of Canada had fundamentally changed the law in <i>Dunsmuir v.
    New Brunswick</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190.  Molloy J. concluded at para. 31 of her
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    noted that “reasonableness” is not merely a function of outcome, but also
    refers to “the process of articulating the reasons”.  The Court also held that
    the concept of reasonableness requires “justification, transparency and
    intelligibility within the decision-making process”.  In the absence of reasons
    setting out what the Tribunal’s decision-making process was, the Tribunal’s
    decision cannot be said to be “justified” or “transparent” or “intelligible”.
    It is incumbent on the Tribunal, particularly in a case of this nature, to
    articulate its reasons so that the parties will know the basis upon which the
    case was decided and the reviewing court can determine whether the decision is
    a “reasonable” one.  The reasons in this case do not enable that process to be
    carried out.  Accordingly, the decision is not a “reasonable one” and is also
    not in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found the reasons wanting, Molloy J. allowed the application and
    quashed the Tribunal’s decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>First Issue: The legal obligation to give reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>It is surely desirable that public decision makers
    empowered by law to make decisions affecting the rights, privileges or
    interests of individuals should, so far as possible, explain their decisions. 
    This helps build public confidence in those decisions and is an important
    mechanism by which the decision makers can be held accountable.  However, that reality
    does not impose on all public decision makers a legal obligation to give
    reasons for every decision.  That is a much more nuanced issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, however, all parties conceded that the Tribunal
    had such a legal obligation.  I agree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Dunsmuir </i>at para. 79, the Supreme Court of
    Canada repeated that procedural fairness is a cornerstone of modern Canadian
    administrative law that requires public decision makers to act fairly in coming
    to decisions that affect the rights, privileges or interests of an individual
    and that what this requires is to be decided in the specific context of each
    case.  A decade earlier, <i>Baker v. Canada</i> <i>(Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 established that <u>in certain
    circumstances</u> the duty of procedural fairness will include a requirement
    that an administrative tribunal provide reasons for its decision.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the circumstances in a particular case must be considered in
    order to determine the content of the duty of procedural fairness, including
    whether it includes the obligation to give reasons.  While acknowledging there
    may be other factors, <i>Baker</i> suggests five factors of relevance to determine
    the content of the duty of fairness: the nature of the decision being made and
    the process followed in making it; the nature of the statutory scheme being
    administered; the importance of the decision to the affected individual; the
    legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision; and respect for
    the choice of procedures made by the administrative agency itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, several of these considerations make it particularly
    important that the Tribunal give reasons as part of its duty of procedural
    fairness.  The decision determines significant legal rights as between Ms.
    Campbell and Ms. Clifford, and the process used involved hearing evidence and
    argument by counsel, much like a court process.  This points to greater procedural
    protections closer to those provided by courts. The fact that the decision is
    the final step in the process also supports the need for greater procedural
    protections.  The importance of determining entitlement to surviving spousal
    benefits to Ms. Campbell and Ms. Clifford is clear.  In summary, to paraphrase <i>Baker</i> at para. 43, it would be unfair for persons subject to a decision such as this
    one not to be told why the result was reached.  In these circumstances, it is
    clear that procedural fairness imposes a legal obligation on the Tribunal to
    give reasons for its decision.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Second Issue: The standard
    of review of the legal obligation to give reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Where an administrative tribunal has a legal obligation
    to give reasons for its decision as part of its duty of procedural fairness, the
    question on judicial review is whether that legal obligation has been complied
    with.  The court cannot give deference to the choice of a tribunal whether to
    give reasons.  The court must ensure that the tribunal complies with its legal
    obligation.  It must review what the tribunal has done and decide if it has
    complied.  In the parlance of judicial review, the standard of review used by
    the court is correctness.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this remains unchanged by <i>Dunsmuir</i>. 
    In his concurring reasons in that case, Binnie J. makes clear that the courts
    cannot defer to the administrative decision maker’s choice of process where
    that decision maker is legally obliged to provide procedural fairness.  He says
    this at para. 129:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]<span lang=EN-US> fair procedure is said to be
    the handmaiden of justice. Accordingly, procedural limits are placed on
    administrative bodies by statute and the common law. These include the
    requirements of “procedural fairness”, which will vary with the type of
    decision maker and the type of decision under review. <u>On such matters, as
    well, the courts have the final say</u>. The need for such procedural
    safeguards is obvious.  Nobody should have his or her rights, interests or
    privileges adversely dealt with by an unjust process.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> With respect, I disagree with the suggestion that <i>Dunsmuir</i> now requires the reviewing court apply the standard of reasonableness to assess
    whether the administrative tribunal has complied with its duty of procedural
    fairness. There is no doubt that the reconsideration of the standards of
    judicial review in <i>Dunsmuir</i> and its conclusion that there should be only
    two standards (correctness and reasonableness) is an important jurisprudential
    development, most particularly where the application for judicial review
    challenges the substantive outcome of an administrative action.  In such a context,
    the discussion in <i>Dunsmuir</i> of the choice of standard of review is vital
    in assessing that outcome.   However, where, as here, the question is whether
    the administrative tribunal has complied with its duty of procedural fairness, the
    court must decide the question.  As Binnie J. said, the court must have the
    final say.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Third Issue: Assessing compliance with the legal obligation
    to give reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an applicant for judicial review argues that an administrative
    tribunal with a legal obligation to give reasons for its decision has failed to
    do so, how is the court to determine if this obligation has been complied
    with?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the rare case where nothing is offered by the tribunal to support its
    decision, the question is readily answered in the negative.  Where something is
    offered, the task is to determine whether, in the context of the particular
    case, this constitutes reasons sufficient to meet the tribunal’s legal
    obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Baker</i>, where the Supreme Court of Canada first explained that
    in certain circumstances the duty of procedural fairness requires reasons to be
    given, it also cautioned that, although it has the final say, the reviewing
    court must use flexibility in determining what constitutes reasons sufficient
    to meet this obligation.  As <i>Baker</i> stated at para. 44, this approach
    recognizes the varied day-to-day realities of administrative agencies and the
    many ways that procedural fairness can be achieved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Important guidance is also provided by <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>, [2008] 3
    S.C.R. 3, particularly paras. 15 to 35. Although a criminal case, the Supreme
    Court of Canada addresses the precise question of what in the context of a
    particular case constitutes reasons sufficient to meet the legal obligation to
    provide a written explanation for a decision.  This is directly relevant to the
    case at bar.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>R.E.M. </i>emphasizes that where reasons are legally required, their
    sufficiency must be assessed functionally.  In the context of administrative
    law, reasons must be sufficient to fulfill the purposes required of them,
    particularly to let the individual whose rights, privileges or interests are
    affected know why the decision was made and to permit effective judicial
    review.  As <i>R.E.M.</i> held at para. 17, this is accomplished if the
    reasons, read in context, show why the tribunal decided as it did. The basis of
    the decision must be explained and this explanation must be logically linked to
    the decision made. This does not require that the tribunal refer to every piece
    of evidence or set out every finding or conclusion in the process of arriving
    at the decision.  To paraphrase for the administrative law context what the
    court says in <i>R.E.M.</i> at para. 24, the “path” taken by the tribunal to
    reach its decision must be clear from the reasons read in the context of the
    proceeding, but it is not necessary that the tribunal describe every landmark
    along the way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R.E.M. </i>also emphasizes that the assessment of whether reasons are
    sufficient to meet the legal obligation must pay careful attention to the
    circumstances of the particular case.  That is, read in the context of the
    record and the live issues in the proceeding, the fundamental question is
    whether the reasons show that the tribunal grappled with the substance of the
    matter: see <i>R.E.M.</i> at para. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, in my view, it is important to differentiate the task of
    assessing the adequacy of reasons given by an administrative tribunal from the
    task of assessing the substantive decision made.  A challenge on judicial
    review to the sufficiency of reasons is a challenge to an aspect of the
    procedure used by the tribunal.  The court must assess the reasons from a <u>functional</u> perspective to see if the basis for the decision is intelligible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is to be distinguished from a challenge on judicial review to the
    outcome reached by the tribunal. That may require the court to examine not only
    the decision but the reasoning offered in support of it from a <u>substantive</u> perspective.  Depending on the applicable standard of review, the court must
    determine whether the outcome and the reasoning supporting it are reasonable or
    correct.  That is a very different task from assessing the sufficiency of the
    reasons in a functional sense.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Fourth Issue: The sufficiency of the reasons in this case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal here was under a legal obligation to given reasons for its
    decision.  It purported to do so.  The question is whether those reasons are
    adequate to meet its legal obligation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is uncontested that the Tribunal was presented with two live issues
    to decide: whether Ms. Campbell and Mr. Clifford had been in a common law
    relationship for at least three years prior to his death; and whether this
    relationship was still in place at the time of his death.  The Tribunal
    identified both questions, grappled with them one after the other and provided
    its answers to both.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In explaining its answer to the first issue, the Tribunal recited
    evidence of the activities of Ms. Campbell and Mr. Clifford after 1999, and of Ms.
    Campbell after his death, that pointed to a common law relationship for more
    than three years prior to Mr. Clifford’s death.  It also recited evidence to
    the same effect from their neighbours about the nature of their relationship.  The
    Tribunal clearly accepted this evidence and found it a sufficient basis upon
    which to conclude that Ms. Campbell and Mr. Clifford had been in a common law
    relationship for the necessary length of time before he died.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal addressed the second issue by first reciting Mr. Clifford’s
    past pattern, absenting himself from Ms. Campbell’s house while on a drinking
    binge but always returning. It then turned to whether anything was different
    about the drinking binge during which he died in February 2005.  It referred to
    evidence that on that occasion Ms. Campbell said to Mr. Clifford’s union
    representative that the relationship had ended and her denial of this.  It
    recited other evidence that tended to show that the relationship had indeed not
    terminated.  It concluded by answering this question in Ms. Campbell’s favour. 
    It is clear that the Tribunal accepted this evidence of a continuing
    relationship at the time of Mr. Clifford’s death and based its conclusion on
    that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the Divisional Court offered a number of reasons for
    finding that the tribunal breached its legal obligation to provide reasons for
    its decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it said that no reasons were provided as to how that decision was
    reached.  With respect I disagree.  The Tribunal gave reasons, as I have
    described. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the majority expressed concern that the Tribunal might have made
    significant errors on matters not addressed in its reasons.  For example, it
    might have misapprehended evidence that it did not refer to.  In my view, that
    is the wrong focus.  The task is to determine whether what was said is
    sufficient, not what problems might have been with what was not said.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the majority faulted the Tribunal for not referring to evidence
    that could have led it to decide differently.  Again, I disagree.  As I have
    described, reasons need not refer to every piece of evidence to be sufficient,
    but must simply provide an adequate explanation of the basis upon which the
    decision was reached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the Tribunal is criticized for making no findings of credibility
    or reliability.  In my view, this is to misread the Tribunal’s reasons.  It set
    out the evidence in support of the conclusions reached on both issues.  Clearly,
    the Tribunal found that evidence to be credible and reliable.  This was open to
    the Tribunal to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the majority said that the Tribunal might have improperly
    reversed the onus of proof by concluding that it was not persuaded that the
    common law relationship had terminated at the time of Mr. Clifford’s death and
    that this uncertainty rendered the reasons insufficient. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree. As <i>Baker</i> indicated, recognition of the day-to-day
    realities of administrative agencies is important in the task of assessing
    sufficiency of reasons in the administrative law context.  One of those
    realities is that many decisions by such agencies are made by nonlawyers.  That
    includes this one.  If the language used falls short of legal perfection in
    speaking to a straightforward issue that the tribunal can be assumed to be
    familiar with, this will not render the reasons insufficient provided there is
    still an intelligible basis for the decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these reasons are clearly sufficient to meet the Tribunal’s
    legal obligation.  Read in the context of the particular case, they demonstrate
    that the Tribunal grappled with the two live issues before it.  From a
    functional perspective, they explain why the Tribunal gave the answers it did to
    those issues. Neither Ms. Clifford nor Ms. Campbell can be left in any doubt
    about that.  Moreover, they allow for effective judicial review of the decision
    itself.  The Tribunal did what was required of it to meet its legal obligation
    to provide reasons for its decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the decision itself, all parties took the position before the Divisional
    Court that on judicial review such a challenge would require deference from the
    reviewing court.  The question is whether the decision was reasonable.  Here
    both the decision itself and the reasoning in support of it meet the standard
    of reasonableness.  There was clearly ample evidence to support the Tribunal’s
    answers to the two live issues before it.  The Tribunal clearly accepted that
    evidence.  It is not up to the court to second guess the Tribunal’s findings.  Having
    made these findings, the Tribunal’s decision in favour of Ms. Campbell is fully
    justified.  The decision meets the standard of reasonableness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the application
    for judicial review.  The appellant does not seek costs here or below.  Ms.
    Campbell played a minor role supporting the appellant in both courts and is
    entitled only to a modest costs order payable by Ms. Clifford which I would fix
    at $1,000 in each court. </p>
