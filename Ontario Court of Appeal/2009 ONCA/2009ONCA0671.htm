  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to review a jury verdict which resulted in her
    action against the Toronto Police Services Board and P.C. Elliott for malicious
    prosecution and negligent investigation being dismissed.  The appellant argues
    that the fundamental error in the charge was the trial judge’s instruction that
    the jury need not know exactly what words were in fact spoken.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel argues that there is disagreement among the witnesses as to what
    the specific words were.  The words are ambiguous and cannot in law amount to a
    threat to cause bodily harm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the trial judge’s charge in this respect. The issue
    before this jury was different from the issue in the criminal prosecution. 
    Here the issue is whether the police officer had reasonable and probable
    grounds to charge the plaintiff with the offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also argues that the trial judge erred in telling the jury that the
    police are not even required to get the accused person’s version of events.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this was merely a reference to an accused person’s right to
    remain silent.  This can be seen from the following sentence in the charge and
    we see no error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third error of which complaint is made is where the trial judge
    relates the plaintiff’s theory of the case to the jury and where at the
    conclusion of the summary expresses his view that he thinks the plaintiff’s
    position is “just plain wrong”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge is obliged to instruct the jury on the
    applicable law.  The plaintiff’s theory of the case was simply wrong in law. 
    The focus is not whether the words spoken are capable in law constituting the offence
    charged but, rather, the focus is whether the investigating officer had
    reasonable and probable grounds to lay the charge he did.  We agree with the
    trial judge and see no error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s comment that it
    was not the role of the jury to second guess the officer’s decision to arrest
    the plaintiff, even if the jury profoundly disagrees with that decision.  In
    our view, as will be seen from a reading of the charge in this section as a
    whole, the trial judge here is attempting to focus the jury on their task which
    was “to determine whether it was unreasonable for the officer to have formed
    his belief in the guilt of the accused.”   The appellant argues the charge in
    this respect limits the jury’s opportunity to come to a different conclusion
    from that of the officer.  We disagree.  The trial judge had to focus this jury
    on the task at hand and we see no error in this aspect of the charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argues the trial judge erred in permitting the
    defence to call Crown Attorney Spiegel, the Crown in charge of the
    prosecution.  His evidence related to the statement read into the record when the
    charges against the plaintiff were withdrawn.  The Crown at the time said that although
    there were reasonable and probable grounds to lay the charge, the public
    interest required that the charge be withdrawn.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this evidence answered the plaintiff’s argument that the
    withdrawal of the criminal charge is some evidence of a lack of reasonable and
    probable grounds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the charge was not a perfect one, we are satisfied that it was a
    fair one overall.  The jury understood their task and their verdict is well
    supported by the evidence.  We would not interfere and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the cross-appeal, in our view, there was no basis here upon which
    to deny the successful parties their costs of these proceedings.  The trial
    judge considered but one factor, the impecuniosity of the plaintiff, which the
    plaintiff says is unchallenged although there was some evidence before the
    court that she had received a settlement from her employer arising out of these
    same circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge must consider all relevant factors and
    while impecuniosity is certainly an important one it can’t be the only one. 
    The defendant’s bill of costs is in excess of $226,000 on a partial indemnity
    scale.  Here there were serious allegations of misconduct on the part of the
    defendants some of which were not withdrawn until after the charge to the
    jury.  This was a four-week jury trial.  There was no novel point of law
    involved.  In our view, the plaintiff’s impecuniosity is clearly a factor which
    here would merit some reduction in the costs sought.  The defendant’s have
    proposed the costs of $50,000 would be appropriate in all the circumstances. 
    In our view, there must be some sanction in terms of costs in the
    circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and order the plaintiff
    to pay the defendants’ costs fixed in the sum of $40,000 all inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the request of counsel for the appellant the costs of the appeal and
    cross-appeal are reserved. Counsel for the appellant is to file brief written
    submissions by September 4, 2009 and the respondent, if desired, by September
    11, 2009.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have since received the written submissions of counsel in relation to
    the costs of the appeal. The respondents are entitled to their costs fixed in
    the sum of $7,500.00 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
