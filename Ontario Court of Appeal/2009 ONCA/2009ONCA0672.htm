  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was tried by Justice Hambly of the Superior Court of
    Justice on one count of fraud over $5,000.  The trial commenced on August 16,
    2004 and continued sporadically over the next three years until August 22, 2007,
    when the appellant was found guilty as charged.  On November 5, 2007, the
    appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for nine months and ordered to make
    restitution in the amount of $109,699.00.  He appeals against conviction and
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeared on his own behalf in this court.  He was ably assisted
    by Mr. Daniel Stein, duty counsel, to whom we are grateful. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Partway through his trial, the appellant applied to the trial judge for
    a <i>Rowbotham</i> order [<i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988) 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont.
    C.A.)].  Because the trial judge was familiar with the appellant’s financial
    circumstances from evidence adduced at the trial, he felt that the <i>Rowbotham</i> application should be heard by a fellow judge.  Accordingly, on May 14, 2007,
    the application proceeded before Justice Ramsay of the Superior Court of Justice
    (the application judge).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of the application, counsel for the appellant, Mr. Charles
    Roach, testified that he was owed substantial legal fees for work he had
    already performed and that unless a <i>Rowbotham/Fisher</i> order [<i>R. v.
    Fisher</i>, [1997] S.J. No. 530 (QL) (Q.B.)] were made, his continued retention
    would result in serious hardship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge determined that this was not a proper case for a <i>Rowbotham</i> order, in part because he was not satisfied that the appellant could not fund
    the trial.  Accordingly, he dismissed the application.  In doing so, he made a
    further order, over the objection of the appellant and absent a formal
    application by Mr. Roach, removing Mr. Roach as counsel of record.  He then
    adjourned the matter for several weeks and ordered the appellant to appear
    before Justice Hambly to continue the trial.  The application judge told the
    appellant that he had two choices at that point: he could either re-retain Mr.
    Roach or complete the trial on his own.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the continuation of the trial, the appellant made a further attempt
    to obtain a <i>Rowbotham</i> order.  The trial judge refused his request and,
    over the appellant’s objection, the trial continued with the appellant
    representing himself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s primary complaint on appeal is that the application
    judge should not have ordered Mr. Roach’s removal from the record.  In doing
    so, he violated the appellant’s right to be represented by counsel and
    compromised the fairness of the trial.   We agree with that submission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our respectful view, the application judge erred in ordering Mr.
    Roach’s removal from the record, part way through the trial, for what effectively
    amounted to non-payment of legal fees.  Unlike the situation in <i>R. v. Downey</i>,
    [2002] O.J. No. 1524, this case did not involve a fundamental disagreement
    between the appellant and Mr. Roach; nor was it one involving a serious break
    down in communications or an ethical dilemma that prevented Mr. Roach from
    continuing to act.  On the contrary, the record shows that while the appellant
    and Mr. Roach may have had some disagreements as to the manner in which the
    case should be defended, Mr. Roach was willing to stay on as counsel so long as
    he was remunerated for his services.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, leaving aside minor disagreements as to how the case should be
    defended, Mr. Roach’s concern was financial.  To the extent that the
    application judge found otherwise, in our respectful view, he erred.  The
    record simply does not support a finding of fundamental disagreement,
    communication break down or ethical dilemma.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, where Mr. Roach had committed to the appellant’s
    defence and represented him for a considerable portion of the trial, it was
    wrong for the application judge to order Mr. Roach’s removal from the record
    for non-payment of legal fees.  See <i>R. v. Brundia</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4051 (Ont.
    C.A.) and <i>R. v. Clement</i>, [2002] 166 C.C.C. (3d) 219 (Ont. C.A.).  Any disagreement
    about fees between Mr. Roach and the appellant should have been for the two of them
    to sort out, either amicably or by means of the civil process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, it was far too late in the process to let Mr. Roach off the
    record, at least without ensuring that the appellant had other counsel who
    could properly represent him.  Any suggestion that Mr. Roach may have been
    duped by the appellant rings hollow.  Mr. Roach had acted for the appellant in
    the past and this was not the first time he experienced difficulty collecting
    his fees.  He also knew, or should have known, the strategy the appellant wished
    to pursue and either refused the brief or protected his fees.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having determined that the appellant’s right to be represented by
    counsel was violated, the appellant need not demonstrate actual prejudice to
    obtain a new trial.  As this court observed in <i>Brundia</i> at paragraph 58:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Given that the appellant was required to represent
    himself at trial even though he had counsel of record, we conclude that his
    right to be represented by counsel was violated and that a new trial is
    required.  Like <i>R. v. McCallen</i> (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 518 (Ont. C.A.),
    this is not a case where the appellant must demonstrate actual prejudice in
    order to obtain an order for a new trial.  Rather, a new trial is required “to
    protect and vindicate the right that has been breached and to ensure the
    perception of fairness of the proceeding”: <i>McCallen</i> at paras. 86-87,
    referring to <i>R. v. Tran</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 218 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, it appears that there may have been prejudice here.  The Crown’s
    case against the appellant was not the strongest and the appellant’s conviction
    was by no means a foregone conclusion.  Indeed, in his lengthy and
    comprehensive reasons, the trial judge rejected all but one of the bases upon
    which the Crown sought to establish fraud.  On the one he did accept – that the
    appellant obtained benefits from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board by
    “representing to the board falsely his life circumstances” – the trial judge
    considered the many gaps and unanswered questions in the Crown’s case and
    stated that it was “not without some anxious consideration after listening to
    the persuasive argument of Mr. Murdoch [Crown counsel]” that he became satisfied
    of the appellant’s guilt.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the appellant was unrepresented in the final stages of the
    trial, it is impossible to know whether the trial judge would have come to the
    same conclusion had he received “persuasive argument” from defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of our conclusion that a new trial must be ordered, we need not
    consider the other grounds of appeal raised by the appellant; nor is it
    necessary to address the issue of sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and a
    new trial is ordered.</p>
