  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Town of Newmarket accepted a tender that contained a discrepancy in
    the bid price. The respondent contractor would otherwise have been the lowest
    bidder.  The respondent commenced an application against the Town, arguing that
    the bid that was accepted was non-compliant, the Town improperly amended that
    bid and it had therefore breached its Contract A with the respondent, according
    to the principles set out  in <i>Ontario v. Ron Engineering &amp; Construction
    (Eastern) Ltd.</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111. By judgment dated May 6, 2008, Pattillo
    J. allowed the application and granted a declaration that the Town breached its
    obligations to the respondent. For the following reasons, I would dismiss the
    Town’s appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 29, 2005, the Town of Newmarket issued a Tender Notice for the construction
    of a new recreational facility known as the Stickwood Walker Recreation
    Facility (the “Project”) and invited four pre-qualified contractors, including the
    respondent, Maystar General Contractors Inc., and the ultimately successful
    bidder, Bondfield Construction Company, to bid on the project.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 15, 2005, the Town publicly opened the Bids and in
    compliance with the Instructions to Bidders, read out and recorded the Unofficial
    Total Bid Price (the figure for “total cost of the work” (the Stipulated Price
    plus GST)) from each bid. Mr. Gordon Sears, the Town's Manager of Purchasing
    and Office Services, announced that the unofficial result was that Maystar was
    the lowest compliant bidder as its total bid price of $35,524,000.00 was the
    lowest. Bondfield's total bid price was $35,874,960.00, the third highest. Mr.
    Sears told the bidders that the Town's consultants would review each bid for
    compliance and accuracy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the opening ceremony, Town staff met to discuss the bids. At
    the meeting, Mr. Kohlmeier, the project architect and a Town consultant,
    noticed a discrepancy in Bondfield’s bid. Bondfield’s Bid Form contained the
    following line items:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.1       …Stipulated Price of &quot;Thirty-three
    million Five Hundred twenty-eight &quot;                        ($33,000,528.00)
    Dollars</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>in lawful money of Canada, included in which are all
    Provincial Sales and Excise taxes, customs duties, freight, exchange, and all
    other charges, except Goods and Services Tax (GST).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.1.1:  …Goods and Services Tax (GST):                                                &quot;Two
    million Three Hundred Forty-six Thousand Nine Hundred sixty&quot;                  ($2,346,960.00)
    Dollars</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.1.2:  The total cost of the work (Stipulated Price
    + GST) is: &quot;Thirty-five million eight hundred Seventy-four Thousand nine
    hundred sixty.&quot;              ($ 35,874,960.00) Dollars</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kohlmeier pointed out that the GST amount shown in article 1.1.1 was
    not 7% of $33,000,528.00, the Stipulated Price stated in line 1.1, but 7% of a
    transposed figure that is not shown: $33,528,000.00. Line item 1.1.2 represented
    the sum of $33,528,000.00 plus the G.S.T. value in line item 1.1.1 of
    $2,346,960.00. Mr. Kohlmeier concluded that Bondfield had made arithmetic or clerical
    errors in its bid form and recommended that the Bondfield bid be considered on
    the basis that the Stipulated Price was correct and represented the lowest bid
    price.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Friday, September 16, 2005, Mr. Kohlmeier sent an email to Mr. Sears,
    where he recalculated the G.S.T. using the Stipulated Price as stated and
    totalled the two amounts to $35,310,564.96. He confirmed his opinion that based
    on the Stipulated Price of $33,000,528.00, the Bondfield bid should be
    accepted. The Town’s Project manager, Ms.&nbsp;Karvonen, wrote a letter dated
    that same day to the Director of Parks, Recreation and Culture suggesting that
    the Town request written confirmation from Bondfield that their bid in line 1.1
    was correct. On Saturday, September 17, Mr. Sears received an e-mail from Ms. Karvonen
    recommending that the Town accept the Bondfield bid. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sears met with the Town’s solicitor on Monday, September 19, 2005.
    They agreed to review the Bondfield bid discrepancy separately and discuss it
    later on. Mr.&nbsp;Sears’ initial inclination was to award the contract to
    Maystar, based on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in <span
class=Italics>Vachon Construction Ltd. v. Cariboo (Regional District),</span> [1996] B.C.J. No. 1409, which he considered to be a very similar case. He prepared
    a draft memo that day recommending that the Town accept Maystar’s bid and
    stating that the Bondfield bid price was uncertain. After meeting with his Director
    and the Town solicitor later that day, he decided not to circulate the memo.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that meeting, Susan Plamondon, the solicitor, brought to Mr. Sears'
    attention the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in <span class=Italics>Bradscot
    (MCL) Ltd. v. Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board</span> (1999),
    42 O.R. (3d) 723 (C.A.). Based on the <i>Bradscot </i>case, Mr. Sears changed
    his view. At that meeting, the Town staff agreed to recommend to Town Council
    that it accept the Bondfield bid. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following that meeting, at approximately 6:30 p.m., Mr. Sears picked up
    a voice-mail message that had been left at 6:09 p.m. by John Aquino,
    Vice-President of Bondfield. The message was:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Hi Gord. My name is John Aquino. I am calling from
    Bondfield Construction. I was calling about the Stickwood Project. Last week we
    were really surprised at the numbers read at the tender opening and we went
    back to our bid and documentation and I would like to talk to you about because
    our bid is lower than what was read out on the bid opening. It's Monday the
    19th of September. It's just before 6 o'clock. You can reach me at my office
    667-8422 or my cell 258-0850. I am going to try you again tomorrow and I am
    going to follow up with a letter to yourself and the architect as well. Take
    care. Bye bye. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Bondfield faxed a letter (the “Bondfield letter”) the next morning,
    September 20,  indicating that an addition error had occurred following last
    minute changes to the base price &quot;which were not carried over to the GST
    calculation&quot; and that the combined price was also wrong. The letter asked
    the Town to evaluate the tender based on the Stipulated Price, which made it a
    lower bid than that of Maystar.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Corrected “Unofficial Tender Results” were circulated to all bidders on
    September 20, 2005. The results showed separate line items for “Total Bid
    Amount” as read out at the opening ceremony on September 15; the “Sub Total
    Bid” amounts exclusive of G.S.T. and the G.S.T. amounts. A second chart showed
    “corrected” and “Revised” G.S.T. and Total Bid Amounts for Bondfield,
    indicating that its bid was now the lowest. The document indicated that
    &quot;these figures have been corrected by the Town of Newmarket Purchasing staff.&quot;
    Bondfield's Total Bid Amount was reduced from $35,874,960.00 to $35,310,564.96.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maystar immediately objected to the corrected tender results. Mr. Sears
    met with Mr. Maio of Maystar that afternoon, telling him that Bondfield had
    made an arithmetic error and that the Town had only notionally corrected the G.S.T.
    amount on the Bondfield bid.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Town convened a special meeting the next day, September 21, 2005.
    That morning, Maystar sent a letter through its solicitors (the “Maystar
    letter”) objecting to the Town’s correction and its proposed acceptance of
    Bondfield’s bid. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The meeting agenda included a copy of a report dated September 20, 2005
    by the Town’s Chief Administrative Officer and the Town’s Parks, Recreation and
    Culture Department (the “Report”) which recommended the acceptance of
    Bondfield’s bid for the corrected amount. A copy of the Bondfield letter was
    attached to the Report, as well as a letter from Mr. Kohlmeier explaining the
    basis of Bondfield's error. An addendum to the meeting agenda attached a
    Deputation Request Form from Maystar and a copy of the Maystar letter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the meeting, Town Council considered the Report and heard a
    deputation from Maystar. They then recessed and held an in-camera session. When
    the meeting resumed, Town Council passed a motion adopting the Report and approving
    the awarding of the contract to Bondfield at the Stipulated Price of
    $33,000,528.00.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Price Uncertainty</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that Bondfield’s bid price was uncertain. He
    relied on <span class=Italics>Vachon Construction Ltd. v. Cariboo (Regional
    District),</span> [1996] B.C.J. No. 1409 (C.A.) for the proposition that price
    is an essential element of a bid and that an offer that is uncertain as to
    price cannot form the basis of a binding contractual relationship. In his view,
    Bondfield committed two errors, one in respect of the G.S.T. amount and the
    other in respect of the total bid price, making it impossible from a review of
    the bid form to tell where its error lay. The uncertainty in price was
    confirmed by the response of the Town’s consultants and of Mr. Sears after
    their respective reviews of the bid, which reflected different opinions as to
    which line item in the bid was accurate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the application judge distinguished <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>. At paras. 41-43, he summarized that decision as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=Italics>Bradscot</span> involved an
    application by an unsuccessful contractor for a declaration that the School
    Board was in breach of its contract to the contractor by accepting a
    non-compliant bid from another contractor. One of the issues in the case was
    whether the bid price of the contractor whose tender was accepted was
    uncertain.&nbsp; The Tender Form in <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span> provided that the contractor set out its stipulated price in Section 2. In
    Section 3, which was entitled “Tender Amount Summary and GST”, there was an
    initial line for the stipulated price, a line beneath it for GST and another
    line for the total which was called the Overall Stipulated Sum Tender Amount.
    The tender in issue set forth in words and numbers in Section 2 a stipulated
    price of $17,720,000.00. In Section 3, the stipulated price was set forth in
    numbers as $17,200,000.00 and the GST was set forth as $1,240,000.00 (7% of
    17,720,000.00). The Overall Stipulated Sum Tender Amount was $18,460,400.00.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the initial application (<a
name=reflex-caselaw-44816198></a>[1998] O.J. No. 2308), Somers J. held,
    notwithstanding the error in Section 3, the tender price of the contractor was
    not uncertain. The learned Judge stated that Section 3 of the Tender Form
    appeared to be a superfluous paragraph being little more than a summary of the
    contract price to which GST is applied. He held that it was clear on its face
    that what occurred was a clerical error. It was the stipulated price in Section
    2 of the Bid Form that governed and that price, listed in both words and
    numbers, was not uncertain. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Somers J.
    and dismissed the applicant’s appeal. In respect of the issue of whether the
    price in the impugned tender was uncertain, Laskin J.A., who wrote the decision
    for the Court, concurred with Somers J.’s analysis of the Tender Form and
    termed Section 3, if not superfluous, at least subordinate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the application judge’s view, the evidence here, unlike in <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, did not support a finding that the provisions
    for G.S.T. and Total Price were superfluous or subordinate; rather, they were
    an operative part of the bid. Unlike in <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span>,
    the bid form contained no separate summary section repeating the stipulated
    price. Further, the Instructions to Bidders contained references to the Total
    Bid Price, and other provisions in the Instructions referred to and
    incorporated the Total Bid Price. Finally, the application judge noted that in <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, unlike in this case, no figures – official or
    unofficial – were read out at the tender opening.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the nature of Bondfield's error was
    similar to the error considered by this court in <span class=Italics>Ottawa
    (City) Non-Profit Housing Corp. v. Canvar Construction (1991) Inc.</span> (2000), 3 C.L.R. (3d) 55 (C.A.). In that case, the tender price and the 5% bid
    bond did not match. Consequently, it was unclear whether the intended bid price
    was the tender price as shown or what the price was if the 5% bid bond was
    accurate. The application judge concluded that in <i>Canvar</i> and in the case
    before him, because the bid price was unclear, the bid was non-compliant and
    incapable of being accepted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that given the uncertainty in the price, the
    provisions in the Instructions did not allow the Town to rectify Bondfield’s
    bid. He held that the error could not be corrected by a matter of simple
    arithmetic recalculation or extension. He noted that the Instructions provided
    that amendments to bids shall not be considered or accepted. Given this
    provision, the Town’s consideration of the Bondfield letter constituted an
    impermissible clarification and amendment which was prohibited by the bid terms
    and which constituted a breach of the Town’s duty of fairness to Maystar under
    Contract A. The application judge held that the “only conclusion which can be drawn
    is that the Council considered the letter in reaching its decision.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ACCEPTANCE OF A NON-COMPLIANT BID</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argued that in any event, para. 1.12.5 of the Instructions
    to Bidders allowed it to accept a non-compliant bid. That para. reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Bidder acknowledges that the Owner may rely upon
    the criteria, which the Owner deems relevant, even though such criteria may not

  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law governing the tender process for public construction contracts
    has been discussed and explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in a number of
    cases beginning with <i>Ontario<span class=Italics> v. Ron Engineering &amp;
    Construction (Eastern) Ltd.</span></i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111, and including <span
class=Italics>M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.</span>,
    [1999] 1 S.C.R. 619, <span class=Italics>Martel Building Ltd. v. Canada, </span>[2000]
    2 S.C.R. 860 and <span class=Italics>Double N Earthmovers Ltd. v. Edmonton
    (City),</span> [2007] 1 S.C.R. 116. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some basic principles for interpreting and applying the terms of tender
    documents have emerged from these cases. <i>Ron Engineering</i> established the
    two layers of contractual relations that arise in the tender process. When a
    contractor submits a tender that complies with the requirements set out by the
    owner in the tender documents, a contract arises, known as Contract A. The
    owner then enters into the construction contract, known as Contract B, with the
    Contract A contractor whose bid is the best bid in terms of price and other
    factors that the owner is entitled to take into account under the terms of the
    tender.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The terms of Contract A are found in the express provisions of the
    tender requirements or can also be implied where the criteria for the
    implication of terms in a contract are met. In <span class=Italics>M.J.B.
    Enterprises</span>, the Supreme Court found from the presumed intentions of the
    parties based on the express terms of the contract, that there was an implied
    term that the owner is obliged to accept only compliant bids. At para. 41, the
    court reasoned that it would not make sense for contractors to engage in the tendering
    process, which is expensive and time-consuming, if the owner could then
    &quot;circumscribe this process and accept a non-compliant bid.&quot; In <span
class=Italics>Double N Earthmovers</span>, at paras. 109-110, the court
    clarified that the compliance required is “substantial compliance” with the
    tender documents and that substantial compliance requires compliance with all
    material conditions of a tender. In <span class=Italics>Martel</span>, at
    para.88, the court found that in order to give business efficacy to the
    tendering process, it was necessary to imply a term that the owner must treat
    all bids fairly and equally. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying these general principles to the Bondfield bid, the issue is
    whether that bid containing the price discrepancy among the amounts shown for
    the stipulated price, the GST and the total cost of the work, substantially
    complied with the tender requirements and was therefore capable of being
    accepted by the appellant Town.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the price was uncertain and therefore
    that the bid was non-compliant and incapable of forming the basis of a
    contract. I agree. The stipulated price, set out in words and in numbers, was
    $33,000,528.00. However, the G.S.T. amount of $2,346,960.00 was not 7% of
    $33,000,528.00 but 7% of $33,528,000.00, a figure not shown in the document;
    and the total cost of the work was $35,874,960.00, which is the total of the
    GST of $2,346,960.00 plus $33,528,000.00. Because the G.S.T. and the total cost
    of the work both reflect a stipulated price that is different from the one
    shown, it is not possible to know which price Bondfield intended. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was also the initial reaction of Mr. Sears. However, he changed his
    mind on the basis that the situation was the same as and was governed by the
    decision of this court in <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span>. In <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, the same contractor, Bondfield, submitted its
    bid with a discrepancy in the price figures set out in the bid form. In <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, Bondfield's stipulated price was set out in
    words and figures in Section 2 of the form as $17,720,000.00. Section 3 of the
    form was titled &quot;tender amount summary and G.S.T.&quot;  The tender amount
    was stated to be &quot;as above&quot;, but read $17,200,000.00. The G.S.T. was
    $1,240,000.00, which is 7% of $17,720,000.00. The overall stipulated sum tender
    amount was stated as $18,460,400.00, which is not a total of any of the
    relevant figures. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court held that Section 3 was only a summary section and was either
    superfluous or at least subordinate to Section 2, the stipulated price. There
    was no uncertainty because the stipulated price was clearly stated in Section
    2. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that, in this case, unlike in <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, the G.S.T.  and total cost of work amounts were
    neither superfluous nor subordinate but were an important component of the
    tender. He came to this conclusion by comparing the tender bid forms in each
    case. In this case, the form contained no summary section; rather, s. 1.1 is
    the stipulated price including all taxes except G.S.T., s. 1.1.1 is the G.S.T.,
    and s. 1.1.2 is the total cost of the work. Further, the Instructions to
    Bidders portion of the tender contains references to the &quot;Total Bid Price&quot;.
    For example, article 1.9.1 provides that the unofficial total bid price would
    be read out at the bid opening. Article 1.7.1.1 provides that the bid security
    to be supplied was 10% of the total bid price excluding taxes, and 1.7.2.4 makes
    provision for contract security in certain percentages of the total bid price
    excluding taxes.  These articles suggest that it is the stipulated price rather
    than the total bid price that is the superfluous figure.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also important to compare the nature of the price discrepancies in
    the two cases. In this case, two of the three prices were consistent with each
    other: the G.S.T.  and the total cost price. The stipulated price stood alone.
    In <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, the stipulated price was consistent
    with the stated G.S.T. amount. Section 3 contained an obvious transcription
    error in the restatement of the stipulated price. This error was made more
    clear by the fact that the G.S.T. amount was accurately calculated on the
    stipulated price as shown in Section 2. The total price was not consistent with
    either those prices or with the inconsistent amount of the restated stipulated
    price. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, therefore, because the
    stipulated price and the G.S.T. calculated on it were consistent, the clerical
    errors in the restatement and in the total bid price were clear. In this case,
    it is unclear whether Bondfield intended the stipulated price to be as stated,
    or to be what the stipulated price would be working back from the total cost of
    the work and G.S.T. calculation. As the application judge found, the nature of
    Bondfield's error is not similar to the <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span> error but to the error made in the case of <span class=Italics>Ottawa (City)
    Non-Profit Housing Corp. v. Canvar Construction (1991) Inc.</span> (2000), 3.
    C.L.R. (3d) 55 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=Italics>Canvar</span>, the tender contained a stipulated
    price of $2,289,000.00 with an enclosed bid bond of $149,450.00. The bid bond
    was stated to be for 5% of the tender price, as required. However, $149,450.00
    is not 5% of the stipulated price but of the higher amount of $2,989,000.00. <span
class=Italics>Canvar</span> realized that it had made an error in setting out
    the stipulated price and sent a letter to the City asking it to adjust the
    tender price or withdraw its bid. The City instead purported to accept the
    favourably low bid based on the stipulated price, but the contractor refused to
    enter into the construction contract at that price. The Court of Appeal agreed
    with the position of the contractor. The tender form together with the bid bond
    showed there was a clear error on the face of the documents and it was unclear,
    based only on the documents, which amount was intended by the contractor to be
    the correct amount. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the application judge erred by finding
    that in this case, unlike <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, the Town
    corrected the Bondfield bid. The appellant says no correction other than a
    notional correction was made to the GST amount to correct a mathematical error and
    that this is allowed by the Instructions to Bidders, although no specific
    article is referenced. I agree with the application judge that the Town clearly
    corrected the Bondfield bid. It chose to view the stipulated price as the price
    intended by Bondfield rather than the total cost amount, then corrected the GST
    calculation and the total cost amount to conform with its choice. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the Town rejected a bid by Vanbots Construction Corporation
    as non-compliant, in part because Vanbots had failed to include its G.S.T. and
    total cost of work amounts in lines 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 of its bid form.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further argues that the application judge had no basis to
    find that the Town relied on Bondfield's oral and written after the fact
    correspondence in making its decision to award the contract to Bondfield and in
    distinguishing <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span> on that basis. In <i>Bradscot</i>,
    Bondfield had also called the owner and stated that there was an error and that
    the stipulated price in Section 2 was the tender price. In that case, the call
    was made within 15 minutes of the close of tenders rather than 4 days later,
    and there was no reading out of the bids or statement of the unofficial lowest
    bid. As in this case, the call was followed up with a fax from Bondfield. In <span
class=Italics>Bradscot</span>, the trial court accepted the evidence of the
    owner's representatives that they were not influenced by the communication from
    Bondfield. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge based his conclusion that the Town did consider
    Bondfield's fax on the fact that the Town council had Bondfield's letter as
    part of the package of documents that was provided to it by staff in order to
    make its decision. Mr. Sears had testified that staff made their decision to
    recommend the Bondfield bid before he received the voice-mail message from Mr.
    Aquino of Bondfield. However, the issue was whether Town Council had considered
    the correspondence. The Town refused to answer any questions on this
    application regarding its <span class=Italics>in camera</span> discussions
    prior to its decision. The application judge was clearly entitled to draw the
    inference from the fact that the Town Council had the Bondfield letter
    explaining its bid, that it considered the letter. The application judge made
    no error in holding that this constituted amending the bid by a facsimile
    letter after the fact, contrary to Article 1.6.4 of the Instructions to Bidders
    and constituted a breach of the duty to treat all bidders fairly and equally.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Town was in a difficult situation. It wanted to accept the lowest
    bid for this project in the best interests of its citizens. The Bondfield bid
    on one reading could have been the lowest bid. The <span class=Italics>Bradscot</span> case appeared to be a very similar situation where the court allowed the owner
    to accept a bid that had a price discrepancy on its face. It no doubt believed
    it was acting in good faith. However, the Supreme Court has made it clear in
    the cases it has decided that the integrity of the tender process is essential
    in order to foster a fair and orderly bidding process where contractors will
    expend the time, effort and expense to bid, knowing they will be treated fairly
    and equally. A public owner cannot undermine that process by purporting to
    accept a bid with an uncertain price, or to encourage contractors to believe
    that they can communicate with owners after the fact to clarify or explain
    inconsistencies in their bids. In <span class=Italics>M.J.B. Enterprises</span>,
    at para. 54, Iacobucci J. pointed out that good faith on the part of the owner
    is not a defence to a claim for breach of contract.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge made no error in his analysis of the <span
class=Italics>Bradscot </span>case and his conclusion that it was
    distinguishable on its facts from the circumstances here.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Issue 2:   Did the terms of the tender documents allow the Town to
    accept Bondfield's bid?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that certain articles in the Instructions to
    Bidders that formed part of Contract A with Maystar, allowed the Town to accept
    Bondfield's bid and that the application judge failed to consider the effect of
    these articles. The appellant relies on the following articles: 1.11.1.3,
    1.11.2, 1.12.3.7, 1.12.3.8 and 1.12.5. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.11.1.3    All
    arithmetic extension calculations are correct.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.11.2        In
    any of the above circumstances where there are obvious or patent errors such as
    misplaced decimals, the Owner shall consider the intent of the Bidder.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.12.3.7    Waive
    any informalities, requirements, discrepancies, errors, omissions, or any other
    defects or deficiencies in any Bid Form or Bid submission;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.12.3.8    Accept
    or reject any unbalanced, irregular, or informal Bids;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.12.5        The
    Bidder acknowledges that the Owner may rely upon the criteria, which the Owner
    deems relevant, even though such criteria may not have been disclosed to the
    Bidder. By submitting a Bid, the Bidder acknowledges the Owner’s rights under
    this Section and absolutely waives any right, or cause of action against the
    Owner and its consultants, by reason of the Owner’s failure to accept the Bid
    submitted by the Bidder, whether such right or cause of action arises in
    contract, negligence, or otherwise.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> These articles allowed the Town to check all arithmetic extensions to
    ensure they were correct, consider Bondfield's intent, waive any discrepancies,
    errors or other defects or deficiencies in the bid form or submission,
    determine whether a bid was substantially compliant, and accept an unbalanced,
    irregular or informal bid. The latter argument with respect to the effect of 1.12.5
    is the subject of a separate ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge did not fail to consider the effect of
    the specific provisions of the tender documents, many of which he set out in
    his reasons. He concluded that the discrepancy and consequent uncertainty in
    the  bid price submitted by Bondfield constituted a fundamental error that was
    not able to be unilaterally corrected or waived using any of the provisions of
    the Instructions to Bidders. It required an amendment of the bid making all of
    the prices consistent with the stipulated price. That amendment was in
    accordance with Bondfield's post-tender correspondence that identified its
    error and explained its intent. Article 1.6.4 prohibits acceptance or
    consideration of any such amendments.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Issue 3:          Did the application judge err by finding that a
    discrepancy in price necessarily rendered the bid non-compliant?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the application judge erred by treating a
    price discrepancy as an automatic non-compliant bid and that the discrepancy in
    the presentation of the price figures by Bondfield in its bid did not
    materially affect the price itself, and gave Bondfield no unfair advantage
    within the tender process. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no merit in this submission. The application judge addressed
    the appellant's main argument that this case was governed by <span
class=Italics>Bradscot,</span> where a price discrepancy was found not to be
    material. The application judge came to a different conclusion in this case for
    reasons already discussed. The reason the price was materially affected in this
    case, unlike in <i>Bradscot,</i> was because there was uncertainty as to which
    price was the intended bid price until the correction was made. That after the fact
    correction gave Bondfield an unfair advantage over other bidders and was not compliant
    with the terms of the tender documents.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span

           The Bidder acknowledges that the Owner may rely upon the criteria, which
    the Owner deems relevant, even though such criteria may not have been disclosed

  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that Bondfield's bid fits the description in article
    1.12.3.8 and that it was entitled to accept such a bid. In other words, even if
    Bondfield's bid was non-compliant, this article allowed the Town to accept it
    without any breach of its Contract A with Maystar.  The application judge
    rejected this submission on the basis that the language of these articles does
    not clearly state that the Town could accept a non-compliant bid. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in <span class=Italics>Tercon
    Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Minister of Transportation and Highways)</span> [2008] 2 W.W.R. 410, the court found that a broadly worded clause in a request
    for proposals had the effect of allowing the owner to accept a non-compliant
    bid. The clause in that case read as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Except as expressly and specifically permitted in
    these Instructions to Proponents, no Proponent shall have any claim for any
    compensation of any kind whatsoever, as a result of participating in this RFP,
    and by submitting a proposal each proponent shall be deemed to have agreed that
    it has no claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court acknowledged that the effect of this interpretation was to
    thwart the public interest in an orderly and fair bidding process. However, it
    had to give effect to the clear language accepted by the parties. The court
    suggested that the public policy could be furthered not by the intervention of
    the courts but by contractors refusing to bid where such clauses govern. An
    appeal from this decision has been argued in the Supreme Court of Canada and is
    under reserve in that court. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the language of the articles referred to in the Instructions
    to Tenderers in this case is distinguishable from the very broad language in
    the <span class=Italics>Tercon</span> document. The waiver of the right to sue
    set out in article 1.12.5 is prefaced by an acknowledgement of the Owner’s
    rights listed in s. 1.12.  It is not clear, therefore, that the waiver was
    meant to have the effect of prohibiting an action by Maystar where a non-compliant
    bid was accepted by the Town. As noted earlier, articles 1.12.3.7 and .8 do not
    specifically allow the owner to accept a non-compliant bid.  I would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
