  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal their convictions and sentences for trafficking in
    marijuana.     Reverend Brother Michael Baldasaro, who was convicted of two counts of
    trafficking, was sentenced to imprisonment for two years.  Reverend Brother
    Walter Tucker, who was convicted of three counts of trafficking, was sentenced
    to imprisonment for one year.  Pursuant to s. 16(1) of the <i>Controlled Drug
    and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (CDSA), the trial judge also ordered
    forfeiture of “offence-related property” consisting of $2,100 cash that police seized
    from Reverend Tucker, and the real property located at 544 Barton Street East,
    Hamilton, Ontario, which was held in the name of the trustees for the Assembly
    of the Church of the Universe.  The Church of the Universe, which was founded
    by Reverend Tucker, professes marijuana to be sacramental. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raised numerous grounds against conviction in their
    original and supplementary notices of appeal.  In their oral argument, the
    appellants referred to four grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellants argued that Reverend Tucker was unable to
    participate fully at trial because he suffers from a hearing deficit.  In our
    view, the record is clear that the trial judge did what he could to accommodate
    Reverend Tucker and we are not persuaded his hearing impairment hampered his
    defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellants challenge the constitutionality of the CDSA<i> </i>on
    the basis of freedom of religion.  In light of prior jurisprudence, they
    indicate that they wish to argue this ground only before the Supreme Court of
    Canada.  In addition, the Crown advises that the appellants abandoned their
    constitutional challenge during pre-trial motions and led no evidence by way of
    a factual background to support their argument<i>. </i> We do not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellants argue that the Crown was obliged to obtain a
    search warrant before coming onto their property to purchase the marijuana. 
    However, the undercover officers were expressly invited into the premises for
    the purpose of purchasing marijuana and it is settled law that undercover drug
    buys do not constitute a “search” under section 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Hence,
    there is no merit to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants allege ineffective assistance of Reverend
    Baldasaro’s trial counsel.  We see no merit in this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn to consider the appellants’ sentence appeals.  The convictions
    related to five separate purchases of marijuana by an undercover police officer,
    two of which occurred on the same day.  All purchases were made at the Barton
    Street premises. Those premises consisted of the Church area on the first floor
    and the appellants’ living quarters on the second floor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In arriving at the sentences of two years for Reverend Baldasaro and one
    year for Reverend Tucker, the trial judge referred to evidence that police seized
    pursuant to a search warrant that was executed on the same day as the last sale. 
    That evidence included 14 pounds of “shake” (marijuana plant stems and leaves);
    7,000 clear baggies bearing a marijuana leaf symbol; a digital weigh scale;
    $2,100 in cash seized from Reverend Tucker, which included buy money provided
    by the undercover officer for the last two purchases of marijuana, and a bank
    deposit book showing a balance of between approximately $3,500 and $14,000 over
    the two-year period between 2002 and 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also considered a statement that Reverend Tucker gave to
    the police when he became the victim of an attempted armed robbery on the Barton Street premises.  In the statement, Reverend Tucker admitted “everyone knows we
    distribute marijuana” and “we don’t do big.”  He explained, “[e]verybody knows
    it’s grams and half-grams.”  The trial judge also referred to his statement, “I
    told [a judge] that if he wants high quality medical marijuana he’d have to
    come to me,” as reflecting an assumption on Reverend Tucker’s part that “he is
    immune from prosecution.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the premises served as a “marijuana
    convenience store operated for profit … but disguised as a church,” with the
    hours of operation posted on a sign at the door.  The trial judge stated that
    the paraphernalia obtained on execution of the search warrant “reinforced” his
    conclusion that the appellants were carrying on a commercial operation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial judge that these were relevant considerations. 
    We are also of the view that it was open to the trial judge to impose a term of
    imprisonment on the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in our respectful view, the trial judge erred in imposing
    sentences that were manifestly excessive having regard to the very small
    amounts of marijuana at issue, which totalled less than ten grams, for which
    the appellants received about $70.  Even taking into account the larger context
    of the transactions, including the appellants’ stated intention to continue
    distribution of marijuana as “sacrament,” the authorities provided to this court
    by the Crown do not support the length of the sentences imposed.  Of the five
    cases cited by the Crown in its factum, none imposed terms of imprisonment of
    more than six months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the one-year sentence imposed on Reverend Tucker did not adequately
    reflect the circumstances of the offences and Reverend Tucker’s circumstances,
    including his age of 75 years and his largely unrelated and very dated (more
    than 30-year-old) criminal record.  We would reduce Reverend Tucker’s sentence
    to imprisonment for three months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While Reverend Baldasaro’s prior convictions were also dated, (more than
    10 years old), he had 12 prior convictions for trafficking, including a
    two-year sentence.  In light of this related record, and in spite of his
    largely positive pre-sentence report, we accept that it was open to the trial
    judge to impose a sentence on the 58-year-old Reverend Baldasaro that was longer
    than the sentence he imposed on Reverend Tucker.  We would reduce Reverend
    Baldasaro’s sentence to imprisonment for five months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we accept that it was appropriate for the trial judge to make a
    forfeiture order of the Barton Street property, we are respectfully of the view
    that only an order for partial forfeiture is justified in this case.  In so
    concluding, we note that no submission was made to the trial judge for partial
    forfeiture and that the trial judge did not have the benefit of recent
    decisions regarding partial forfeiture from the Supreme Court of Canada.  In
    particular, Abella J. explained at para. 59 of <i>R. v. Craig</i><span
style='line-height:200%'>, (2009) <span class=ssl21><span style='line-height:
200%'>244 C.C.C. (3d) 1,</span></span> that “judges have the discretion to
    order no forfeiture, partial forfeitur</span>e or full forfeiture for
    offence-related real property.”  She further noted that forfeiture is also
    available for property held in the name of a third party.  At para. 17, she
    quoted the explanation provided by Wittmann J.A. in <i>R. v. Gisby </i>(2000)<span
class=c41><span style='line-height:200%'> </span></span><span class=c41><span
style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'>148 C.C.C. </span></span><span
class=c91><span style='line-height:200%'>(3d) 549 (Alta. C.A.) at para. 21,
    where he stated that “it is often the case that offence-related property is not
    owned by the offender, but by a culpable third-party with some sort of
    relationship to him or her, and continues to be used for illicit purposes by
    other persons.”   </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the marijuana sales, as found by the trial judge, were part
    of a commercial venture.  That venture was carried on from the first floor of
    the Barton Street premises.  There was no evidence that trafficking activity
    occurred in the living quarters of the appellants on the second floor.  We also
    observe that this was not a situation meriting full forfeiture.  An example of
    such a situation is described at para. 59 of <i>Craig</i> as one “of a
    fortified property purchased for criminal purposes and solely dedicated to the
    commercial production and distribution of illegal substances, perhaps with a
    connection to organized crime.”  There was no evidence that the upstairs
    portion of the premises was operated for the purpose of growing or distributing
    marijuana.  Indeed, the evidence indicated that the entire second floor was
    used as the appellants’ personal residence.   This situation, in our view, lent
    itself to a partial order.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown advises that the mortgagee, who is now in possession of the
    property, estimates that the owner has equity of approximately $22,000.  In the
    circumstances, a forfeiture order would be appropriate for half the value of
    the equity in the property after the usual deductions.  We so order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeals against conviction are dismissed.  The
    appeals against sentence are allowed and the sentences imposed are set aside.  In
    substitution, Reverend Tucker is sentenced to three months imprisonment and
    Reverend Baldasaro to five months imprisonment.  These sentences are in
    addition to time spent in pre-trial custody, which we understand was at most a
    few days.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The forfeiture order for 544 Barton Street East, Hamilton, Ontario is
    set aside.  Instead, a forfeiture order will issue for half the equity of that
    property to which the appellants would otherwise be entitled on its sale.  </p>
