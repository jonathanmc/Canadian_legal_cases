    another offence.  </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In mid-1996, a youth court judge found Emmanuel
    Bedard not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder in connection
    with a series of offences against the person all of which were prosecuted summarily. 
    In 1996, and in every year since, the Ontario Review Board has decided that
    Bedard should be confined at the Oak Ridge Division of the Mental Health Centre
    at Penetanguishene.  Oak Ridge is this province’s only maximum security
    psychiatric facility.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Emmanuel Bedard assaulted another patient at Oak
    Ridge, a sex offender who had been remanded for assessment at the hospital. 
    The attack was premeditated, the injuries to the victim, significant. Bedard
    was convicted of assault causing bodily harm and sentenced to a term of
    imprisonment to be served at Millbrook, a provincial reformatory.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At Millbrook, Bedard, with the help of others,
    attacked another convicted sex offender. This time, the victim died. A jury
    found Bedard guilty of manslaughter.  Dangerous offender proceedings followed a
    long and winding road to their conclusion on April 6, 2005, nearly three years
    after the underlying conviction had been recorded.  The trial judge found
    Emmanuel Bedard to be a dangerous offender and sentenced him to detention in a
    penitentiary for an indeterminate period.  And so it was that Emmanuel Bedard
    became, at once, a dangerous and dual status offender.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Bedard says that the dangerous offender
    proceedings taken against him were procedurally and substantively flawed.  He
    should either have a new hearing or be sentenced to a term of imprisonment that
    is fit for the predicate offence of manslaughter.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal and affirm both the dangerous offender finding and the sentence imposed.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            An Overview</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The grounds of appeal advanced on the
    appellant’s behalf betray the need for any detailed account of the
    circumstances that underpin the predicate offence of manslaughter, or for an
    elaborate reprise of the evidence adduced on the dangerous offender hearing. 
    What is more to the point here is a rehearsal of the protracted and tortuous
    procedural path the proceedings have followed from the underlying conviction to
    final determination. But first, some background.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Mental Disorder Finding</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant is the second of a sibline of
    three born to mentally-disordered parents.  He began life in a dysfunctional
    family.  At age 2, he was apprehended by child welfare authorities because he
    failed to thrive.  By age 5, he had become a Crown ward.  Before he reached age
    12, Bedard had been shunted around among three dozen foster homes. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant required a highly-structured environment
    and close supervision.  Yet, even then, assaults on some and threats to others
    continued.  Finally, while in a highly-structured program that included
    medication, the appellant became embroiled in further assaults and threats. The
    prosecutor proceeded summarily on several charges.  The appellant was found NCRMD
    on June 7, 1996.  The underlying mental disorder was said to be paranoid
    schizophrenia.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Disposition by the Ontario
    Review Board</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s disposition hearing was
    conducted before the Ontario Review Board shortly after the NCRMD finding.  It
    was common ground that the appellant could only function in a highly-structured
    setting, like the forensic unit of a psychiatric hospital.  He was a long-term
    threat, especially to female staff, in any hospital.  He required maximum
    security.  And the only maximum security facility in the province for male
    NCRMD detainees was and remains the Oak Ridge Division of the Mental Health
    Centre at Penetanguishene.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Ontario Review Board ordered the appellant’s
    detention at Oak Ridge.  He became one of, if not the youngest of detainees at
    the hospital.  On every subsequent review, the Board has confirmed the
    appellant’s detention at Oak Ridge.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></h3>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Offences at Oak Ridge</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s assaultive behaviour persisted
    at Oak Ridge.  He sucker-punched a staff member, breaking his nose.  He took
    the lead in a pre-concerted attack on a convicted sex offender who had been
    remanded to Oak Ridge for assessment.  The victim suffered serious injuries.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In late November, 1999, the appellant was
    transferred from Oak Ridge to Millbrook Correctional Centre to serve a 12 month
    sentence for assault causing bodily harm arising out of one of the attacks at
    Oak Ridge.  The imposition of the sentence of imprisonment made the appellant a
    dual status offender.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Predicate Offence</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Within a few months of his arrival at Millbrook,
    the appellant again led a pre-concerted attack on a fellow inmate, another
    convicted sex offender.  The inmate died from the beating the appellant inflicted
    with a melamine cup “loaded” with wet, wadded toilet tissue.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>Trial Proceedings</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 29, 2002, a jury found the appellant
    guilty of manslaughter in the beating death of his fellow Millbrook inmate. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Notice of Intention</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Immediately after the return of the jury’s
    verdict, the prosecutor indicated that he was “seeking an opportunity to make
    an application” to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender. The
    prosecutor acknowledged the need to prepare and serve the relevant notices, to have
    the appellant assessed, and to obtain the consent of the Attorney General to
    the application. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge adjourned the proceedings to
    June 28, 2002, to permit the prosecutor to take the necessary procedural
    steps.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Notice of June 13, 2002</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a notice of application dated June 13, 2002,
    the prosecutor sought an order to have the appellant assessed under s. 752.1(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The notice described the material relied upon in
    support of the application, including the appellant’s criminal record and the
    circumstances upon which each conviction was based, the details of several
    outstanding charges involving institutional misconduct, and the contents of a
    report of December 15, 1998, describing the appellant’s background and institutional
    behaviour over several years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By its terms, the notice referred to the
    language used in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in
    support of the claim that the appellant might be found to be a dangerous or
    long-term offender.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Consent of June 26, 2002</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 26, 2002, the Director of Crown
    Operations for the Central East Region signed a consent “on behalf of the
    Attorney General”.  The recitals included in the consent referred to an
    application for assessment under s. 752.1(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, as
    well as “the consent of the Attorney General of Ontario as required by s.
    754(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada </i>”.  The text of the consent
    refers to “consent to the application to remand Emmanuel Bedard … for
    assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>”.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Remand for Assessment on
    June 28, 2002</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the return date of the application, June 28,
    2002, the trial judge remanded the appellant to the Mental Health Centre at Penetanguishene
    for a period not exceeding 60 days to begin on July 11, 2002.  The assessment
    was to be completed by Dr. Derek Pallandi or his designate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s conduct at the Mental Health
    Centre caused the premature conclusion of the assessment period.  On July 17,
    2002, the appellant was returned to custody at Millbrook Correctional Centre.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Pallandi completed his assessment report on
    October 4, 2002.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Dangerous Offender Hearing</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The dangerous offender hearing began on May 12,
    2003, nearly one year after the jury had found the appellant guilty of
    manslaughter.  The appellant did not object to the commencement of the
    proceedings, or suggest that all relevant disclosure had not been made in a
    timely way.  In particular, the appellant did not suggest that proceedings were
    barred because the Attorney General had not consented to the application,
    either before or after it had been made.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The prosecutor concluded his case on the
    dangerous offender application on May 21, 2003. The appellant neither gave nor
    adduced any evidence. The hearing was adjourned to permit the parties to
    prepare their submissions.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Request to Re-Open</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly before the hearing was scheduled to
    reconvene for submissions on June 19, 2003, the prosecutor gave disclosure to
    the appellant about an incident at Millbrook on June 10, 2003.  The prosecutor
    also indicated that he wanted to re-open his case and adduce evidence of the
    appellant’s conduct during the recently disclosed incident in support of the
    application to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 21, 2003, the prosecutor’s application
    to re-open the dangerous offender application to permit the introduction of the
    further evidence was dismissed. </span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Complaint About Lack of
    Consent</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s counsel began his submissions on
    the merits of the dangerous offender application on July 24, 2003.  Then, for
    the first time, counsel for the appellant (not Mr. Derstine) argued that there
    was no application before the judge to have the appellant declared a dangerous
    offender.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The prosecutor responded that the earlier
    application included both the assessment and dangerous offender hearing.  The
    prosecutor offered to file a separate application to have the appellant
    declared a dangerous offender, if the judge required it.  The issue was not resolved
    by the trial judge. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Several adjournments followed the conclusion of
    the submissions of counsel.  The parties awaited release of the judgment of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Johnson</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Place of Remand</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In November and December, 2003, the applicant,
    then an inmate of Central East Correctional Centre after the closing of
    Millbrook Correctional Centre, sought an order remanding him to the Mental
    Health Centre at Penetanguishene.  The application was based on the reasons of
    the Ontario Review Board, released on September 22, 2003.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 14, 2003, the trial judge remanded
    the appellant to the Mental Health Centre to await the conclusion of the
    dangerous offender application.  An attempt by the prosecutor to review this
    order failed.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Further Evidence</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 4, 2004, the prosecutor called Dr.
    Lisa Ramshaw, a forensic psychiatrist involved in the appellant’s treatment at
    Oak Ridge.  She testified about the use of clozapine for the appellant’s
    treatment, but her evidence did stray into an assessment of the appellant’s
    dangerousness.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Further Submissions</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The day after Dr. Ramshaw completed her
    evidence, counsel made submissions on the substance of the dangerous offender
    application, as well as on various procedural infirmities and their effect on
    the validity of the proceedings.  The sentencing judge required written

    jury had found the appellant guilty of the predicate offence, the trial judge
    found the appellant to be a dangerous offender and sentenced him to detention
    in a penitentiary or an indeterminate period.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    requirements of s. 754(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> had been met.  Despite
    its “abysmal” drafting, the document signed by the Director of Crown Operations
    on June 26, 2002, constituted, at once, a valid consent on the part of the
    Attorney General and an application to have the appellant declared a dangerous
    offender. The later consent of the Attorney General regularized the proceedings
    in a timely way since the Attorney General’s consent could be given at any time
    before the application had been judicially determined.</span></p>

    Notice of Application, dated June 13, 2002, which sought an assessment order,
    adequately outlined the basis on which the application to have the appellant
    declared a dangerous offender was founded, thus satisfying s. 754(1)(b).  The
    appellant had earlier been notified of the prosecutor’s intention in open court
    immediately after the guilty verdict was returned.</span></p>

    a dangerous offender within the definition contained in s. 753(1)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and expressed no doubt that the finding could equally have been made
    under s. 753(1)(a)(ii).  The evidence persuaded the trial judge that there was
    no reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the appellant posed
    to others in the community.  He declined to exercise his residual discretion
    not to declare the appellant a dangerous offender, despite proof of the
    conditions precedent, on the basis that the Review Board retained jurisdiction
    over the appellant as an NCRMD detainee and dual status offender.</span></p>

    any complaints about the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence adduced at
    the dangerous offender hearing, but  advanced two arguments having to do with

    sentencing judge’s residual discretion in light of the continuing authority of
    the Ontario Review Board and the appellant’s position as a dual status
    offender.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first complaint relates to <i>notice</i>.
    The prosecutor was required to give notice of an application to have the
    appellant declared a dangerous offender, as well as to provide notice of the
    basis upon which the application would be founded.  These requirements are
    conditions precedent to the validity of the application. Despite oral notice of
    the prosecutor’s intention to apply to have the appellant declared a dangerous
    offender, Mr. Derstine says the trial judge failed to consider the need for
    strict compliance with the notice requirements, which are conditions precedent
    to the validity of the hearing.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant focuses next on the <i>consent</i> of the Attorney General required by s. 754(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. 
    Mr. Derstine says that the incidental reference to the consent of the Attorney
    General in the recitals of the document signed by the Director of Crown Operations
    does not meet the requirements of s. 754(1)(a).  The content of this document
    makes it plain that it relates to the application for assessment under s.
    752.1, not the application to have the appellant declared a dangerous
    offender.  That the proceedings continued on the assumption by all concerned
    that consent had been provided is of no moment since a valid consent to the
    application is a condition precedent to a valid hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to Mr. Derstine, the second consent
    provided by the Attorney General was too little, too late, emerging only after
    the evidentiary part of the hearing had passed into history and counsel had
    made their submissions.  Further, even if a consent can be retrospective, the
    terms of the consent here, which referred to “proceedings being instituted”,
    speak to the future not to the past.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Derstine says that to construe the verb
    “hear” or its past tense (or participle) “heard”, as if it were “determine” or
    “determined” is plainly wrong.  Although the consent of the Attorney General
    may be given “before or after the making of the application”, it is a condition
    precedent to, thus must be given prior to the hearing of the application. 
    Failure to comply with a condition precedent to the conduct of a hearing
    renders the hearing, as well as the decision made at its conclusion, a nullity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. Stewart characterizes
    the issues as twofold:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>Was the original consent valid?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>Was the later consent timely?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first consent, Mr. Stewart begins, was given
    on behalf of the Attorney General by the Director of Crown Operations.  The
    document refers to “the consent of the Attorney General of Ontario as required
    by s. 754(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>.”  The consent to which
    s. 754(1)(a) refers is the consent to the making of an application under Part
    XXIV, in this case, an application to have the appellant declared a dangerous
    offender. This consent was given before the hearing of the application – eleven
    months before any evidence was introduced.  Everyone appears to have accepted
    it as valid and proceeded accordingly. The trial judge’s conclusion about the
    validity of this consent is unassailable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning to the second consent, Mr. Stewart characterizes
    it as curative by nature, something provided out of an abundance of caution.
    The purpose of the consent requirement is to ensure that, prior to any <i>determination</i> of a convicted person’s status as a dangerous or long-term offender, the
    Attorney General has made an informed decision that the circumstances warrant
    pursuit of such a designation.  As long as the Attorney General’s consent
    precedes a decision on the merits, the proceedings are regular.  Such an
    interpretation provides a fair, large and liberal construction of the
    requirements of s. 754(1)(a) and best ensures the attainment of its objects. 
    Substantial compliance is sufficient, especially as here where there is no
    scent, let alone substance of prejudice.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The
    Governing Principles</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Proceedings under Part XXIV involve several
    steps that begin with an offender’s conviction of a “serious personal injury
    offence” as defined in s. 752 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as it then read.  As
    a general rule, applications to have an offender declared a dangerous offender
    must be made <i>before</i> sentence is imposed for the underlying serious
    personal injury offence, although the <i>Criminal Code </i>does permit
    applications to be made within six months after the imposition of sentence for
    the predicate offence in limited circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once the prosecutor has given notice of his or
    her intention to seek a dangerous offender finding, the next procedural step
    involves an assessment of the offender, followed by the completion and filing
    of an assessment report with the convicting or other court.  It is for the
    prosecutor to initiate the assessment process by an application under s.
    752.1(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  An order for assessment is not for the
    asking: it may only be ordered where the judge is satisfied that there are reasonable
    grounds to believe that the offender might be found to be a dangerous or
    long-term offender under Part XXIV. The enabling provision does <i>not</i> require that the application for an assessment be in written or any prescribed
    form, or that it be accompanied by the consent of any other authority, for
    example, of the Attorney General.</span></p>

    Code of Canada</i>”.  Doubtless, the reference to the consent of the Attorney
    General to the application to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender
    was more oblique than it should have been.  That said, consent to the
    application was provided by a lawful deputy of the Attorney General and preceded
    the <i>hearing</i> of the application as s. 754(1)(a) required.  The
    superfluous consent of the Attorney General to an assessment of the appellant
    under s. 752.1(1) does not render the consent to the application ineffectual.</span></p>

    terms, that an application to declare a person convicted of a serious personal
    injury offence a dangerous offender shall not be <i>heard</i> without the

lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As we saw earlier, when a person who is subject
    to a custodial disposition under s. 672.54(c) as a consequence of an NCRMD finding 
    becomes subject to a sentence of imprisonment for another offence, that person
    becomes a dual status offender as defined in s. 672.1(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  It is the concurrent existence of these two placements, not the
    underlying findings, that create the dual status offender.</span></p>

    long-term offender and sentenced to a term of imprisonment as part of the
    disposition.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This ground of appeal claims error in the
    failure of the sentencing judge to take into account the authority of the

    deciding whether to exercise his discretion not to declare the appellant a
    dangerous offender despite satisfaction of the statutory requirements of sections
    753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>
  <h3>            The Decision of the Sentencing Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge concluded that the evidence
    adduced established that the appellant was a dangerous offender within the
    definition in s. 753(1)(a)(i) and equally within s. 753(1)(a)(ii), although it
    was not necessary for him to make the latter finding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge, following the mandate of <i>R.
    v. Johnson</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, turned next to consider whether there was
    a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the appellant posed in
    the community, thus permitting a long-term rather than a dangerous offender
    designation. The sentencing judge rejected this prospect, principally on the
    basis of the expert psychiatric opinions of Dr. Pallandi and Dr. Ramshaw.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge recognized that he had a
    residual discretion not to find the appellant a dangerous offender despite
    satisfaction of the criteria. He began his discussion of this issue in these
    terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court must, therefore, look under <i>The Queen
    v. Johnson</i> to the last criterion, and that is the residual discretion,
    notwithstanding a finding can be made, that the court indeed has some
    discretion left and must consider the <i>Criminal Code</i> guidelines for
    sentencing under Part XXIII.  Considering the matter as a whole, it seems that
    there is no less intrusive alternative available when we consider Mr. Bedard’s
    background and the nature of the offences.  There is no reason why this
    discretion should be exercised to deny the Crown’s request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge next turned to the
    relevance of the appellant’s position as a dual status offender and the effect
    of the authority of the Ontario Review Board under Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>on the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion.  He concluded in
    this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Indeed, as to this last issue of final discretion,
    it has been argued by Mr. Miller that, because Mr. Bedard is already a dual
    status offender under the control of the Ontario Review Board, that he will not
    likely be released without psychiatric or other intervention, and that
    therefore there is an alternative that the court must consider.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, the court is not satisfied that this is a
    proper matter to consider in the sense that its discretion should be exercised
    in allowing the Review Board to determine the ultimate determination.  Upon
    these facts, Mr. Bedard has been found competent to stand trial and no motion
    or evidence has been brought before the court that he is not able to deal with
    this matter.  Mr. Bedard, indeed, has had input from time to time as to where
    he should be incarcerated. The issue for the court now is whether the risk to
    the community under the provisions of s. 753(1) can be dealt with or managed. 
    The court must deal with this and cannot abrogate its role to the Review
    Board.  Having made the findings that the court deems appropriate, it can see
    no alternative to making a finding and it is not satisfied that leaving the
    eventual release to the Review Board would be appropriate in these
    circumstances.  This is particularly so when the court has reached  its
    conclusion with regard to Mr. Bedard’s future controllability.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the dangerous offender application has been made out.  Indeed, there is
    nothing that would indicate that, having been made out, why in the court’s
    final discretion an indeterminate sentence should not be imposed.</p>
  <h3>The Positions of the Parties
    on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the appellant, Mr. Derstine contends that
    the sentencing judge should have exercised his discretion not to declare the
    appellant a dangerous offender despite satisfaction of the standard in s.
    753(1)(a)(i) because the public can be protected against the appellant in
    another way. The Ontario Review Board, a tribunal steeped in experience with
    dangerous persons and rich in expertise, has authority over the appellant as a
    mental disorder detainee.  The appellant has been, currently is and for the
    foreseeable future is likely to remain in custody in the maximum security Oak Ridge
    Division of the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene.   Release or lessened
    restrictions will only occur if the Board is satisfied that the appellant is
    not a significant threat to the safety of the public.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Derstine says that the sentencing judge
    erred in rejecting as irrelevant to the exercise of his residual discretion the
    concurrent authority of the Ontario Review Board over the appellant, the effect
    of which is to ensure the appellant’s custody and the community’s protection
    until it becomes safe to release him. To consider the Board’s concurrent
    jurisdiction as a factor in deciding whether to exercise his residual
    discretion is <i>not</i> an abrogation of jurisdiction to the Board. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. Stewart approaches the
    issue somewhat differently.  The sentence imposed here, according to s.
    672.67(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, takes precedence over the earlier NCRMD
    finding and custodial disposition.  The sentencing judge was keenly aware of
    the residual discretion reposed in him not to declare the appellant a dangerous
    offender despite satisfaction of the statutory requirements.  He considered the
    issues of treatability and manageability and correctly concluded that
    treatability was, at best, an expression of hope.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart takes the position that even if the
    sentencing judge was wrong to reject as irrelevant to the exercise of his
    discretion the interplay of the jurisdiction of the Review Board, the result of
    its consideration would have left the decision made as the only viable
    conclusion in the circumstances.  </span></p>
  <h3>                        The Governing Principles: The Statutory Discretion
    under Part XXIV</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since the serious personal injury offence of
    which the appellant was convicted occurred before July 2, 2008, the authority
    to declare him a dangerous offender resided in the former s. 753(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  In its operative part, the subsection provided that the sentencing
    court “may … find the offender to be a dangerous offender” if satisfied that
    the statutory requirements have been met.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The use of the permissive “may” reposes a discretion
    in the sentencing judge: <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, Chap. I-21, as
    amended, s. 11.  Thus, the sentencing judge retains a discretion whether to
    declare an offender dangerous who meets the criteria required for that
    designation: <i>Johnson, </i>at para. 16.  Nothing in the section indicates a
    duty to find an offender dangerous once the statutory criteria have been met: <i>Johnson</i>,
    para. 18.  This interpretation of former s. 753(1) finds support in the purpose
    of the dangerous offender regime, the principles of sentencing, and the
    principles of statutory interpretation: <i>Johnson</i>, at para. 18.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is an established principle that
    indeterminate detention under the dangerous offender regime is warranted only
    insofar as it actually serves the purpose of protecting the public: <i>Johnson</i>,
    at para. 20.  Circumstances may exist in which a convicted offender meets the
    statutory criteria for a dangerous offender designation, but the goal of
    protecting the public can be assured without indeterminate detention: <i>Johnson</i>,
    at para. 20.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dangerous offender proceedings form part of the
    sentencing process.  It follows that their interpretation is guided by the
    fundamental purpose and the principles of sentencing contained in ss. 718 to
    718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>: <i>Johnson</i>, at para. 23.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among the principles that guide a judge’s
    discretion whether to declare a convicted person a dangerous offender is the
    fundamental principle of proportionality and the principle of restraint. 
    Together, these principles require a sentencing judge to consider the
    possibility that a less restrictive sanction would attain the same sentencing
    objectives that a more restrictive sanction seeks to achieve: <i>Johnson</i>,
    at para. 28.</span></p>

    at para. 29; <i>R. v. Hatchwell</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 43.  The
    principles of sentencing mandate that a judge should impose an indeterminate
    sentence <i>only</i> in circumstances in which there are no less restrictive
    means by which to protect the public adequately from the threat of harm posed
    by the offender.  Those less restrictive means include at least a definite
    sentence (for the underlying serious personal injury offence) or long-term
    offender designation: <i>Johnson</i>, at para. 29.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the usual case, the essential question for
    the sentencing judge becomes whether the sentencing sanctions available under

    criteria for designation as a dangerous offender have been satisfied: <i>Johnson</i>,
    at para. 29.</span></p>
  <h3>            The Governing Principles: The Supervision of Mental Disorder
    Detainees</h3>

lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Persons found NCRMD are entitled to a
    disposition hearing conducted by the trial court or Review Board.  The factors
    that the court or Review Board must take into account and the range of

lang=EN-US>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At a disposition hearing, the critical question
    for the judge or Board is whether the mental disorder detainee is a
    “significant threat to the safety of the public”.  The answer to this question
    is critical to the nature of the disposition that the judge or Board may make.
    Where the court or Board concludes that the mental disorder detainee is a
    significant threat to the safety of the public, two options are available: a
    discharge subject to conditions, or detention in custody in a hospital, subject
    to conditions: </span><i>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatry Institute)</i>, <span lang=EN-US>[1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para. 62.</span></p>

    other disposition that the Board considers appropriate in the circumstances.

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 759.3(b) permits a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal
    from a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period, but
    says nothing of the criteria the court is to consider or apply. The referential
    incorporation by s. 759(7) of “the provisions of Part XXI with respect to
    procedure on appeals” adds nothing since the sub-heading “Procedure on Appeals”
    in Part XXI does <i>not</i> include the dispositive authority of s. 686, which
    immediately follows the sub-heading, “Powers of the Court of Appeal”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite the absence of express incorporation of the curative
    proviso of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) in appeals under Part XXIV, it seems implicit in <i>Johnson</i> that an appeal may be dismissed under s. 759(3)(b) if an error in law has
    caused the appellant no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice: <i><span
lang=EN-US>Johnson</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 49.  See also, <i>R.

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As in other instances, the application of the
    curative proviso is limited to those circumstances in which there is no reasonable
    possibility that the verdict would have been any different had the error in law
    not been made: <i>Johnson</i>, at para. 49. See also, <i>R. v. Bevan</i>,
    [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617.  A failure to consider the availability of the
    long-term offender provisions, for example, would only rarely be forgiven by
    the application of the proviso: <i>Johnson</i>, at para. 50.</span></p>
  <h3>            The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With the benefit of the decision in <i>Johnson</i>,
    the sentencing judge recognized that he retained a discretion whether to
    declare the appellant a dangerous offender despite being satisfied that the
    appellant met the criteria for that designation. The sentencing judge also
    appreciated that one factor he was obliged to consider in determining how to
    exercise this discretion was the possibility that the sanctions available under
    the long-term offender provisions of Part XXIV, a term of imprisonment followed
    by a community supervision, would be sufficient to achieve the objectives that
    the dangerous offender provisions seek to advance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge’s conclusion about the
    inadequacy of the long-term offender provisions to achieve the objectives that
    the dangerous offender provisions seek to advance was reasonable, firmly rooted
    in the evidence.  For all practical purposes, the evidence on this issue was
    all one way.  The appellant suffers from a severe antisocial personality
    disorder for which there is no known treatment, much less cure.  He is a high
    risk to recidivate violently.  The intensity of his violence and aggression has
    increased in the recent past.  He can only function in a highly-structured
    surrounding and, even in such a setting, is likely to continue his aggressive and
    violent behaviour.  The sentencing sanctions available under the long-term
    offender regime are demonstrably insufficient to reduce the threat to public
    safety posed by the appellant to an acceptable level.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge also acknowledged that the
    discretion whether to declare the appellant a dangerous offender is regulated
    by the relevant principles of sentencing contained in Part XXIII of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and developed in the jurisprudence.  He concluded, once again with
    ample sustenance from the evidence, that no less intrusive sentencing
    alternative was available after consideration of the appellant’s background and
    the nature of his offence.  I would not interfere with his conclusion on this
    basis.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It seems reasonable to conclude that, in most
    instances in which Part XXIV is invoked, the residual discretion to declare a
    convicted offender dangerous, despite satisfaction of the criteria for that
    designation, is to be exercised or not in the context of two less restrictive
    means by which to protect the public adequately from the threat of harm:</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>It was in this context that <i>Johnson </i>was
    decided.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For some against whom dangerous offender
    proceedings are taken, such as this offender, the circumstances may also include
    the involvement of another statutory scheme that has, as one of its guiding
    principles, the need to protect the public from dangerous persons and the harm
    that such persons might cause:  <i>Winko</i>, at para. 62.  This other scheme,
    for which Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides, forms no part of the
    sentencing regime under Part XXIII of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and is not
    engaged by a finding of guilt or conviction of any offence.  To the contrary,
    Part XX.1 becomes engaged only when a person charged with crime is found not
    criminally responsible for his or her conduct on account of mental disorder. 
    And although a court will be involved in recording the special verdict of not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, and perhaps in making the
    initial disposition, the ultimate determination of the manner in which the risk
    posed by mental disorder detainee will be managed rests with the provincial
    Review Board.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Criminal Code</i> defines “dual status
    offender” in s. 672.1(1) and in s. 672.67, declares whether it is the term of
    imprisonment or custodial disposition that takes precedence pending any placement
    decision made by the Review Board. Neither Part XX.1 nor Part XXIV contains any
    provision that expressly, or by necessary implication, says anything about the
    influence of a custodial disposition under s. 672.54(c) or the supervisory
    authority exercised by the Review Board on the residual discretion that former
    s. 754(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provided to sentencing judges.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In one sense, it could fairly be said that what
    Part XX.1 dictates for the supervision of mental disorder detainees is <i>irrelevant</i> to the discretion not to declare a person a dangerous offender despite
    satisfaction of the essential criteria.  Regardless of their common element of
    ensuring the protection of the public, each Part manages its own constituency
    uninfluenced by the other.  Two solitudes.  To ensure appropriate custody, the placement
    decision procedure of s. 672.68 is available.  A scheme that manages persons
    who are not criminally responsible for their conduct should have nothing to say
    about whether a person, criminally responsible for his or her conduct and
    meeting the requirement for designation as a dangerous offender, should nonetheless
    not be so classified. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, under s. 754(1), the essential question
    that the sentencing judge has to decide is whether the sentencing options
    available in connection with the specific predicate offence with which the
    judge is concerned are sufficient to reduce the threat to an acceptable level. 
    Sentencing is a highly individualized, fact-specific exercise.  While an
    offender’s history is relevant to the sentence to be imposed in an individual
    case, Part XX.1 supervision is not.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, the <i>principles</i> of
    sentencing dictate that an indeterminate sentence, the [now] inevitable result
    of a finding that the appellant is a dangerous offender, should only be imposed
    in circumstances in which less restrictive means do not exist by which to adequately
    protect the public from the risk of harm: <i>Johnson</i>, at para. 29.  It
    should not matter whether those means are available within Part XXIV, the
    general sentencing provisions of Part XXIII, or, as here, under Part XX.I by the
    Review Board.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is not necessary to come to a firm conclusion
    on the influence, if any, of the prior mental disorder finding and ongoing supervisory
    authority of the Review Board on the exercise of residual discretion under former
    s. 754(1).  For unless the prior NCRMD finding and ongoing supervisory
    authority of the Review Board mandates the exercise of discretion against a
    dangerous offender designation fully supported by the evidence, which I am not
    prepared to conclude, there is no reasonable possibility that the conclusion reached
    here would have been any different had the scheme of Part XX.1 been taken into
    account.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant is a very dangerous man.  Violent.
     A recidivist.  Violent recidivism next best to a sure thing.  A severe
    antisocial personality disorder.  No known treatment.  No known cure. Requires
    a highly-structured setting and, even there, as the history plainly establishes,
    an  unremitting management problem and repeated acts of violence.  The
    designation “dangerous offender” fits, unfortunately all too well.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not advance argument on his
    appeal against his conviction of manslaughter, the predicate offence.  I would
    dismiss that appeal as abandoned.  For the reasons given, I would also dismiss
    the appeal from the sentence of imprisonment for an indeterminate term imposed
    as a result of the dangerous offender finding.</span></p>
