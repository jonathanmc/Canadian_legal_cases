    and the public remained constant, their percentage of the total shareholding is

    “major transaction” within 18 months of being listed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     That major transaction
    was the purchase by North Shore, in 1998, of the shares of 1083181 Ontario Ltd.
    (“108”).  108 owned Park Shore, a nine-hole golf course in Brampton valued at
    $1.4 million.  108, Arrowsmith (now North Shore), Pennington Trust,  and
    Hubland,  the latter two being the vendors, entered into a share purchase
    agreement dated December 2, 1998 (the “Share Purchase Agreement”).  The contract
    was amended twice by agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span

    that Arrowsmith was to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[B]y Arrowsmith issuing such number of Arrowsmith

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first amending agreement, dated February 1, 1999, amended the value

    number of provisions in the original agreement.  Significantly, the purchase
    price was to be satisfied in part by the issuance of Arrowsmith common shares
    and partly by Arrowsmith preference shares.  The purchase price was amended from
    $1.4 million to $1.2 million.  Article 2.1(c) was deleted and replaced with the
    following provision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       The
    Purchase Price shall be satisfied by Arrowsmith issuing to the vendors
    2,675,000 Arrowsmith Common Shares at a deemed price on the effective date of
    $0.20 per share and 3,325,000 Arrowsmith Preferred Shares at a deemed price on
    the Effective Date of $0.20 per share.  One-half of the Arrowsmith Common
    Shares and one-half of the Arrowsmith Preferred Shares to be issued shall be
    issued in the name of the Trust and the other half of the Arrowsmith Common
    Shares and the other half of the Arrowsmith Preferred Shares shall be issued in
    the name of Hubland.  The Arrowsmith Preferred Shares are convertible into
    common shares in the capital of Arrowsmith on a one-for-one basis subject to
    Arrowsmith maintaining public distribution requirements as specified by the
    Alberta Stock Exchange.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following subsection (d) was added to s. 2.1:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)      The
    2,675,000 Arrowsmith Common Shares issued in part satisfaction of the Purchase
    Price will be subject to an escrow and will be released as to 1/3 on each of
    the first, second and third anniversaries of the approval of the transaction by
    the shareholders of Arrowsmith. The 3,325,000 Arrowsmith Preferred Shares will
    be subject to a performance escrow pursuant to which one Arrowsmith Preferred
    Share will be released from escrow for each $0.20 of cash flow of Arrowsmith,
    after adjustment for certain non-cash items.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purchase price was reduced by $200,000.  The common shares of
    Arrowsmith issued to the vendors, Pennington Trust and Hubland, in part

    judge’s finding that the Escrow Agreement was ambiguous is final and conclusive
    on that point.  It was not open to the trial judge to revisit the issue.  In <i>Toronto
    Dominion Bank v. Leigh Instruments Ltd</i>. <i>(Trustee of) </i>(1997), 35 O.R.
    (3d) 273 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.), defence counsel moved before Spence J., in the
    course of the litigation, for production of a certain memorandum.  Spence J.
    declined to grant the order on the grounds that the memorandum had been
    prepared in contemplation of litigation and, as such, was properly subject to
    the claim of litigation privilege.  Later in the course of that same litigation,
    counsel for one of the defendants moved before the trial judge, Winkler J., to
    ask in cross-examination seven questions of the witness who had prepared the
    memorandum. The purpose and objective of the questions was, as the trial judge articulated
    at para. 1: “to provide a basis for a motion to require production of the
    memorandum at trial”. Counsel for the plaintiff objected to the questions on
    the ground that they went to the root of the claim for privilege, the propriety
    of which had already been finally determined by Spence J.  He argued that the
    defendant was bound by that ruling and was prohibited, by operation of the
    doctrine of issue estoppel, from re-litigating that issue.  The trial judge
    accepted the plaintiff’s argument and dismissed the </span>defence’s<span
lang=EN-US> motion on the basis that the doctrine of issue estoppel operates to
    prevent parties from re-litigating the same issues.  At para. 7 of his reasons,
    Winkler J. stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The effect of an interlocutory
    decision in subsequent proceedings between the same parties was considered by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Diamond v. the Great Western Realty Co.</i>,
    [1924] S.C.R. 308. In that case, the Court held that an interlocutory judgment
    which definitely decides a question of law and from which no appeal is taken
    may be binding when the question is raised between the same parties, even in
    the same action.  Duff J. stated for the majority at pp. 315–316:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>Now to this argument there
    appears to be one conclusive answer.  The point raised by it was decided
    against <i>Diamond </i>in the judgment given by Mr. Justice Middleton on the
    appeal from the first report.  The claim thus advanced was one he held which
    the referee, under the terms of the reference, had no jurisdiction to examine.
    This judgment of the learned judge was a definite decision upon a definite
    point of law.  From that decision no appeal was taken, and it seems to have put
    an end to the controversy.  It is true to say that in a sense the decision was
    interlocutory; that is to say, the proceeding in which it was given was an
    interlocutory proceeding; but it was nevertheless a final decision in the sense
    that in the absence of an appeal it became binding upon all parties to it …. The
    application of the principle is not affected, it is, perhaps, needless to say,
    by the circumstance that the first decision is pronounced in the course of the
    same action.</span></p>

    concurring reasons, stated at p. 10:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Where the issue determined is not

    issue.  They cannot subsequently in the same suit advance argument or adduce
    further evidence directed to show that the issue was wrongly determined.  Their
    only remedy is by way of appeal from the interlocutory judgment and, where
    appropriate, an application to the appellate court to adduce further evidence….</span></p>

    Escrow Agreement was clear and unambiguous.  Her task was to accept that the
    document was ambiguous and to interpret it accordingly.  As Doherty J.A. of
    this court explained in <i>Dumbrell v. The Regional Group of Companies Inc</i>.
    (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 616, at para. 52, contractual interpretation involves the
    interplay between the words of a contract and the context in which those words
    were chosen:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>No doubt, the dictionary and
    grammatical meaning of the words (sometimes called “the plain meaning”) used by
    the parties will be important and often decisive in determining the meaning of
    the document.  However, the former cannot be equated with the latter. The
    meaning of a document is derived not just from the words used, but from the
    context or circumstances in which the words were used.  Professor John Swan
    puts it well in Canadian Contract Law (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 2006) at
    493:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>There are a number of inherent
    features of language that need to be noted.  Few, if any words, can be
    understood apart from their context and no contractual language can be
    understood without some knowledge of its context and the purpose of the
    contract.  Words, taken individually, have an inherent vagueness that will
    often require courts to determine their meaning by looking at their context and
    the expectations that the parties may have had.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, it is helpful to consider the purpose of
    the document in its context. The Escrow Agreement was one of a number of

    as an issuer on the ASE, Arrowsmith had to complete a “major transaction”
    within 18 months of being listed.  Arrowsmith satisfied the ASE’s requirement
    when it purchased all of the shares of 108 in 1998.  At the time, 108 owned a
    nine-hole golf course in Brampton valued at $1.4 million.  All of the

    conditional approval from the Alberta Stock Exchange for its revised major
    transaction, originally announced October, 1998.  The major transaction will
    consist of the non-arm’s length acquisition of the Park Shore Golf Course, a
    nine-hole executive golf course located west of Toronto, Ontario.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Hawley was a founding partner in the creation of
    Arrowsmith. He, along with Pennington and Fasken, put up the original seed
    capital to get the company started in early 1998. Their goal was to get
    Arrowsmith into the Junior Capital Program of the ASE. That program was
    intended to allow new companies to raise funds from the public and then to
    acquire assets – the “major transaction” – to grow the company to a point where
    it would become an issuer on the ASE. The terms and conditions of the major
    transaction, as well as all documents, had to be submitted to the ASE for
    approval.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The only document that states that the
    performance escrow is to be based on 108’s performance, rather than Arrowsmith’s,
    is a letter dated April 16, 1999, from the ASE to Mr. Olley. At p. 2 point 9 of
    that letter, Denise Hendrickson, a listings analyst writing on behalf of the
    ASE, states that the common shares, term loan, and private placement are
    subject to the ASE’s standard Form 10A escrow agreement. The preferred shares
    are subject to the ASE’s standard Form 10B escrow agreement “with one share
    being releasable from escrow for each $0.20 of Cash Flow generated by 108 Inc.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ASE’s letter is the only document in the record that
    makes this reference and, as such, the only reasonable conclusion is that the
    reference to 108, instead of Arrowsmith, is a mistake. It is unfortunate that
    someone from ASE was not called to give evidence on this point.  In my view, absent
    evidence to the contrary, logic suggests that the reference is simply an
    error.  The ASE’s only interest is in the growth of the company listed in its
    Junior Capital Program: Arrowsmith, not 108. Additional evidence in support of
    my conclusion can be found in the Share Purchase Agreement, which contains
    several references to the cash flow of Arrowsmith. Nowhere does it refer to the
    cash flow of 108.  Moreover, since it is the shares of Arrowsmith in which the
    public will be asked to invest, it is logical that it is the issuance of those
    shares with which the ASE is concerned.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Upon careful review of ASE’s April 16 letter, it
    is clear that ASE is simply requiring formal copies of the documents,
    appraisals, and valuations already prepared by Arrowsmith’s solicitors and
    accountants. Those documents all state that the performance escrow in relation
    to the preferred shares is to be based on the cash flow of Arrowsmith.  If ASE intended
    to change that requirement from what it was stated to be in the Circular, Share
    Purchase Agreement, and two subsequent amending agreements, it would have said
    so in clear and unambiguous terms.  It did not.  This letter can be no more
    than the ASE repeating what it understood the deal to be and giving its
    approval. If ASE intended the deal to be different from what the contract
    documents provided, that would constitute a significant change; one which would
    need to be brought to the specific attention of the parties to the contract. 
    Nothing of the sort occurred.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>20.       Subsequent to the use of

    definition of property.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>“Cash Flow” is defined in the document as the
    “net income derived from the property as shown on the audited financial
    statements or verified by the Issuer’s auditor”.  The respondent’s argument is
    that cash flow refers to the net income derived from the shares of 108, as
    opposed to the net income of Arrowsmith.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If the reference is to the net income of 108, as
    opposed to the net income of Arrowsmith, then the appellants were not entitled
    to as many shares as were released to them from escrow.  If, however, the
    reference is to the net income of Arrowsmith, the shares were properly
    released.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, I note that the net income is to be that
    shown on the audited financial statements, or verified by the auditors, of the
    Issuer – Arrowsmith – not 108.  Arrowsmith’s financial statements do not show
    the net income derived from the shares of 108. The consolidated financial
    statements show the income and expenses of the golf course owned by 108, but
    the golf course is not the property referenced in the preamble to the Escrow Agreement. 
    The major transaction was not an asset purchase.  Arrowsmith acquired the shares
    of 108. Any net income from the shares would be dividend income and none is
    shown.  Also, the call is not for what is shown on the audited statements of
    108 or for the net income as verified by 108’s auditors, but rather for those
    of the Issuer, Arrowsmith.</span></p>

    depletion, deferred taxes, amortization of goodwill, and amortization of
    research and development costs in clause 1(a)(i) – (v) of the Escrow Agreement
    have no relevance whatsoever if the “property” is the shares of 108. Nothing in
    that clause applies to dividends from shares.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the references in paras. 1(b) and (c) are

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the agreement itself contemplates that
    the meaning of the language used may change depending on context.  At para. 1,

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth, as indicated earlier in these reasons,
    the ASE is concerned with the earnings of Arrowsmith, since it is the company that
    is listed on its Junior Capital Program.  It is only when that company’s
    earnings are at a certain level that it will authorize the issuance of
    preference shares.  While this was the first “major transaction” in 1999/2000,
    it was not the last.  Arrowsmith later acquired other interests.<a href="#_ftn6"

lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition, in all Arrowsmith’s audited
    financial statements, the reference to the subject preference shares is stated
    in the following terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The 3,325,000 Preferred Shares
    will be subject to a performance escrow pursuant to which one Preferred Share
    will be released from escrow for each $0.20 of cash flow of the Company, after
    adjustment for certain non-cash items.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This reference can only be to Arrowsmith.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Annual Report of Arrowsmith Limited for the
    years 2001 and 2002 repeat precisely the same reference to the subject
    preference shares as above. Again, the reference can only be to the cash flow
    of Arrowsmith.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In both the audited financial statements and the
    annual reports of Arrowsmith, the reference is to the “cash flow of the
    Company, after adjustment for certain non-cash items.”  Those “non-cash items” are
    found at para. 1(a)(i) – (v) of the Escrow Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the ASE accepted the application for
    release from escrow and was obviously satisfied with it before it agreed to the
    release of the shares.  Had it not been satisfied,  it  would not  have  released
     the  shares.  Further, even after Hawley made his</span></p>
  <br
clear=all>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>complaint to the ASE, taking the
    position he has in this litigation, the ASE did nothing.  The ASE did not even
    respond to his complaint.  Therefore, it is a reasonable inference that had the
    ASE been of the view that Hawley’s position was correct, it would never have
    released the shares from escrow when the application was made or, minimally,
    would have taken steps on receipt of Hawley’s complaint.  Neither of those
    things happened.  This further reinforces my view that the reference to the
    “cash flow of 108” in its April 16, 1999 letter to Mr. Olley was simply an
    error.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was nothing improper with Fogler, Rubinoff
    LLP’s application to the ASE for the release of shares on behalf of the
    company.  The Escrow Agreement contemplates the application being made either
    by the security holders or the issuer.  The security holders have the right to
    the receipt of the shares in payment for the shares they sold to the issuer and
    the issuer has the obligation to pay for those shares by release of its
    security.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It must have been apparent to Hawley at all
    times, including when he approved the acquisition of the shares of 108, that
    his share holding would be diluted once the transaction was completed.  Both
    Pennington and Fasken, or their corporate nominees, would have treasury shares
    issued to them – Hawley would not.  There is nothing “oppressive” about that
    fact. Hawley is, and was, a meticulous man, as can be seen from his notes on
    the draft financial statements he reviewed.  Arrowsmith acquired all of the
    shares of 108 and had to pay for it.  Pennington and Fasken owned 108’s golf course,
    valued at $1.4 million, via their shareholdings in 108, and were entitled to be
    paid for it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no objection to the liquidation of
    Arrowsmith.  Hawley consented to the liquidation in 2004 and, accordingly, that
    cannot in any way be raised by him as “oppressive conduct”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Hawley’s sole basis of complaint is that the
    shares were improperly released from escrow.  He argues that the net income of
    108 was significantly less than that of Arrowsmith and, as such, was not
    sufficient to permit the number of shares released from escrow to the
    appellants.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the foregoing reason, I am of the view that
    the only reasonable interpretation of the Escrow Agreement is that the phrase
    “net income derived from the property” refers to the net income derived from
    the property Arrowsmith.  In my view, the documentary evidence overwhelming,
    supports this conclusion.</span></p>
