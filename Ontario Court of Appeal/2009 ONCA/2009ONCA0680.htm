  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.J. was born on October 21, 1990.  He had a difficult and deprived
    childhood.  By the age of 15 he was exhibiting signs of major mental illness
    and has been diagnosed to suffer from schizophrenia.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he robbed a drugstore with a gun,
    during which he was shot six times by the police.  As a result, he has required
    significant hospital treatment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 2009, a few months after his eighteenth birthday, he was
    found NCR and remanded to the Dovercourt Youth Home pending a hearing before
    the Ontario Review Board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that hearing, the parties, all of whom had counsel, were J.J., the
    Crown and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”).  Counsel agreed
    that J.J. posed a significant threat to the safety of the public and that a
    custodial disposition was necessary.  Counsel jointly submitted that the
    appropriate disposition for J.J. was at Syl Apps Centre, a youth mental health
    facility where J.J. could receive an individualized assessment taking into
    account his young age and special long-term needs, and a longer-term plan could
    be devised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless the Board ordered that J.J. be detained at CAMH in Toronto in
    medium security.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAMH appeals from this disposition, supported by <i>amicus curiae </i>on
    behalf of J.J., and the intervenor, the Provincial Advocate for Children and
    Youth.  The Crown opposes the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s primary position is that the Board’s disposition is
    unreasonable and therefore cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the reasonableness of the Board’s disposition, s.672.78(1)(a)
    of the <i>Criminal Code </i>requires this court to ask itself whether the Board’s
    risk assessment and disposition were unreasonable in the sense of not being
    supported by reasons that can bear even a somewhat probing examination.  See: <i>R.
    v. Owen,</i> [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779 at para. 33.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s risk assessment here was that J.J. continued to pose a
    significant threat to the public and that his detention was therefore
    required.  There was clear evidence to support this conclusion and indeed at
    the hearing all parties proposed such a finding, although <i>amicus</i> now
    suggests that his detention is not required.  We see no basis to set aside the
    Board’s risk assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However the Board’s disposition is a different matter.  The placement
    alternatives considered were Syl Apps Centre in Oakville and CAMH in Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board preferred CAMH for two reasons.  First, it said the J.J.
    should stay close to the Toronto hospitals which had provided medical treatment
    to him for the complications arising from his gunshot wounds because he may
    require further treatment of the same kind in the future.  However, there was
    no evidence that the same level of medical expertise would not be available to
    him in Oakville if he were placed at Syl Apps.  Indeed, it would be surprising
    if such evidence could be found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Board found that J.J.’s mother and siblings, his only
    support network, would have innumerable logistical problems visiting him or
    communicating with him if he were at Syl Apps, because they live in Toronto. 
    Here, as well, there was simply no evidence to support the conclusion that
    J.J.’s support network could not be as effective if he were placed in Oakville
    rather than Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, both factual bases offered by the Board for preferring CAMH to
    Syl Apps are without evidentiary foundation.  Its reasons for choosing CAMH
    over Syl Apps cannot bear even a somewhat probing analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Board’s decision to place J.J. in medium security at CAMH
    is unreasonable.  There was no evidence that the risk he presented required
    this level of security.  On the contrary, the evidence was that if placed at
    CAMH, minimum security would be sufficient.  Moreover, the Board offered no
    reasons whatsoever for ordering his detention in medium security, contrary to
    the requirement that it give reasons.  See: <i>R. v. Brunczlik</i> (2002), 61 O.R.
    (3d) 321 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We therefore conclude that the board’s disposition is unreasonable and
    must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given this conclusion, we need not deal with the Provincial Advocate’s
    submission that the Board’s disposition is unlawful because the provisions of
    the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act </i>and the <i>Criminal Code</i> require that
    J.J. be placed at Syl Apps because of his age, since it is the only facility
    designated for the custody treatment or assessment of young persons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor would we give effect to this argument when determining the
    appropriate remedy.  It was not raised at first instance, something that could and
    should be done first at a subsequent hearing before the Board, if it is to be
    pursued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appropriate remedy must be determined in light of the
    fact that it has been some five months since the Board’s disposition and much
    may have changed with J.J.  The best course is to remit J.J.’s case to the Board
    for a new hearing, but on an expedited basis.  J.J.’s present condition and
    circumstances can then be properly considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore allowed and the matter remitted to the Board to
    be dealt with according to these reasons.</p>
