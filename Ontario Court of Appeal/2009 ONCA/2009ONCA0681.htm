    dispute.  After the settlement was concluded, Peters brought a motion under r.

    involved in the waste disposal business.  In 1993, they and others combined
    their businesses in a company named Universal.  By 1995, however, Peters and
    Giglio decided that they no longer wanted to be in business together.  In
    December 1995, they reached an agreement whereby Peters bought Giglio’s
    interests in Universal.  The agreement included a covenant by Giglio not to
    compete with Universal.</p>

    agreement.  Giglio sued Peters for damages for breach of contract, breach of
    fiduciary duty, negligence, misrepresentation, conspiracy and oppression. 
    Peters defended the action and counterclaimed against Giglio, Cam Tenaglia and
    others.  Peters alleged that Giglio and Tenaglia owned and operated a waste
    disposal business called Preferred Recycling Inc.  He claimed that by doing so,
    Giglio had breached his non-competition covenant in the 1995 agreement and that
    Tenaglia had induced the breach.  Giglio’s action and Peters’ counterclaim were
    started within the limitation period.</p>

    required Giglio and Tenaglia to provide an affidavit in support of Peters’
    contemplated r. 57.07 motion seeking costs from Battiston and any Law Society
    complaint filed again Battiston.  Because the settlement contemplated Peters’
    motion, the action itself, though resolved, remains outstanding.  It has not

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Peters brought his motion in the action in June
    2008.  He attributed the delay to the difficulty in obtaining affidavits from
    Giglio and Tenaglia.  Peters relies on r. 57.07(1)(c), which provides that a
    court may make an order requiring the lawyer personally to pay the costs of another
    party to the litigation.  Rule 57.07(1) states in its entirety the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>57.07(1) Where a lawyer for a party has caused
    costs to be incurred without reasonable cause or to be wasted by undue delay,
    negligence or other default, the court may make an order,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) disallowing costs between the lawyer and
    client or directing the lawyer to repay to the client money paid on account of
    costs;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) directing the lawyer to reimburse the
    client for any costs that the client has been ordered to pay to any other
    party; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) requiring the lawyer personally to pay the
    costs of any party. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orders under this rule are understandably rarely made.  In this case,
    Peters alleges, among other things, that Battiston caused costs to be incurred
    without reasonable cause by advising Giglio to bring unfounded claims, by
    knowingly participating in the giving of false testimony, and by encouraging
    his clients to be dishonest.  The validity of these allegations remains to be
    determined on the motion itself.</p>

  <h3>First Issue: Is Peters’ rule 57.07 motion barred by s. 4 of the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 4 of Ontario’s <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. Unless this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding
    shall not be commenced in respect of a claim after the second anniversary of
    the day on which the claim was discovered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peters “discovered” the basis for the costs order he seeks against
    Battiston in late 2001 and early 2002 when Giglio and Tenaglia changed their
    evidence.  He did not bring his motion until 2008.  Therefore, if his motion is
    subject to s. 4, it is well beyond the two-year prescription period and would
    be statute-barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The resolution of this issue turns on whether Peters’ motion is a
    “proceeding … in respect of a claim”.  Thus, we must decide whether Peters’ motion
    is a “proceeding” and if it is, whether it is in respect of a “claim”.  For the
    reasons set out below, I have concluded that Peters’ motion is not a “proceeding”. 
    That conclusion is supported by recent case law from our court, and by the
    context and legislative purpose of the statute.  It is therefore not necessary
    to decide whether Peters’ motion is in respect of a “claim”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The word “proceeding” is not defined in the <i>Limitations Act,</i> <i>2002</i>. 
    Battiston submits that it should be given a very broad meaning, which would
    encompass Peters’ motion, in order to achieve the overriding purpose of the
    statute: to prevent stale claims from going forward.  Battiston notes that he
    was not a party to the litigation and ceased to have any role in it after
    2002.  Yet six years later, Peters seeks a costs order against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his submission, Battiston relies on the definition of
    “proceeding” in <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, and on cases in the Superior
    Court such as <i>Imoney</i> <i>Corp. v. Quebecor Communications Inc.</i>, [2002]
    O.T.C. 486 (S.C.), aff’d [2002] O.S. No. 4447 (C.A.) defining “proceeding” in
    other contexts.  <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 9th ed., defines “proceeding”
    as “an act or step that is part of a larger action”.  On its face, this
    definition is broad enough to include a motion in an action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <i>Imoney</i> case the defendant brought a motion under s. 106 of
    the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. C.43 to stay the plaintiff’s
    summary judgment motion.  Section 106 gives the court discretion to “stay any
    proceeding”.  Although she declined to grant the stay, Hoy J. held that she had
    jurisdiction to do so.  Relying on the definition in <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> she held that a motion for summary judgment is a “proceeding” under s. 106.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The meaning of “proceeding” in s. 4 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> is a question of statutory interpretation.  As with any question of statutory
    interpretation, context and legislative purpose are paramount considerations. 
    In the well-known and often quoted words of the late Professor John Willis,
    “words, like people, take their colour from their surroundings” (“Statute
    Interpretation in a Nutshell” (1938), 16 Can. Bar. Rev. 1 at 6).  Neither a
    dictionary meaning of a word nor the meaning of that word in a different
    statutory context is determinative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here the word “proceeding” appears in a statute that, as Battiston
    points out, seeks to bar stale claims.  However, in the context of a prescriptive
    statute, the legislation seeks to bar the commencement of stale litigation, not
    steps within litigation that has been commenced within the statutory time
    period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of this context and the statute’s purpose, and in the
    absence of any definition of “proceeding” in the statute itself, successive
    panels of this court have turned to the definition of “proceeding” in the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  Both Feldman J.A. in <i>Meady v. Greyhound Canada
    Transportation Corp.</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 774 (C.A.), and later Simmons
    J.A. in <i>Placzek v. Green</i> (2009), 245 O.A.C. 220 (C.A.), have held that
    the word “proceeding” in s. 4 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> has the same
    meaning as “proceeding” in r. 1.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Proceeding” under r. 1.03 refers to the commencement of litigation
    either by action or application; it does not refer to a motion within an
    action.  Thus, under r. 1.03(1):</p>

    counterclaim, cross-claim, or third or subsequent party claim; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“Application” means a proceeding commenced by notice of
    application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under these definitions, a motion within an action is not a
    “proceeding”.  Indeed, “motion” is defined in r. 1.03(1) to mean “a motion in a
    proceeding or an intended proceeding”.  Peters’ motion under r. 57.07 is an
    unusual kind of motion because it is brought against a non-party.  Yet our
    rules provide for just such a motion.  But it remains a motion, and, moreover,
    a motion in the existing action between Peters and Giglio and other parties. 
    It is not a “proceeding” under s. 4 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To give effect to Battiston’s submission would mean that the two-year
    limitation period in s. 4 would govern many steps in the litigation.  Many
    motions in the litigation – for example, a summary judgment motion – would each
    have its own two-year limitation period.  This would make litigation, as we
    know it, unworkable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that r. 57.07(2) provides that the court on its own
    initiative can make an order for costs against a lawyer.  Again, if we were to
    give effect to Battiston’s submission, the court itself would be subject to the
    two-year limitation prescription period, a proposition that, in my view, is untenable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peters and Battiston also disagreed on whether the order Peters seeks is
    a “claim” under s. 4 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>.  Claim is defined in
    s. 1 of the Act to mean “a claim to remedy an injury, loss or damage that
    occurred as a result of an act or omission”.  Battiston argues that this
    definition is broad enough to cover the relief Peters seeks.  Peters argues to
    the contrary.  As I have said, it is unnecessary to resolve this debate because
    even if Peters’ motion is in respect of a claim, it is not a proceeding in
    respect of a claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Second Issue: Is Peters’ rule 57.07 motion an abuse of
    process?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge ruled that Peters’ motion did
    not constitute an abuse of process.  Battiston submits that the motion judge
    erred in his ruling, and advances three arguments to support his submission. 
    First, he contends that the motion judge made no finding that Battiston
    incurred costs needlessly.  Second, he contends that Peters’ real motive for
    bringing this motion is not to recover his costs, but for the improper purpose
    of punishing Battiston.  Third, he contends that Peters recovered his costs as
    part of his settlement with Giglio and therefore would be overcompensated if
    the court ordered costs against Battiston.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept these arguments.  Battiston’s
    contentions may well be live issues on the r. 57.07 motion itself, but none
    afford a basis to prevent that motion from being heard on its merits.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On Battiston’s first contention, it is true the
    motion judge made no finding that Battiston had incurred costs needlessly or
    “without reasonable cause”.  Whether that finding ought to be made is an issue
    for the motion judge on the r. 57.07 motion.  Indeed, unless the court makes
    that finding, it cannot make a costs order against Battiston.  That the motion
    judge did not make this finding does not transform Peters’ r. 57.07 motion into
    an abuse of process.  It simply means that the merits have yet to be heard.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Battiston’s second contention, that Peters
    brought his motion for an improper motive, fails for lack of any supporting
    evidence.  Battiston chose not to cross-examine Peters, Giglio or Tenaglia on
    their affidavits filed on the r. 57.07 motion, and chose not to file his own
    affidavit evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Instead, Battiston points to the two-year delay
    before Peters brought his motion and to the Law Society complaint Peters filed
    against Battiston contemporaneously with his motion as some evidence of
    improper motive.  Standing alone, however, without any other evidence, neither
    the delay nor the Law Society complaint credibly sustains a finding of improper
    motive.  On the record before the motion judge, the claim of improper motive
    was entirely speculative.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On Battiston’s third contention, under the terms
    of the settlement agreement between Peters and Giglio, Peters received no
    payment for costs.  The agreement expressly provided that the $150,000 Peters
    did receive was for damages.  Whether, as Battiston claims, this characterization
    of the $150,000 was contrived to permit Peters to bring his r. 57.07 motion is
    an issue to be resolved on the hearing of the motion.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons I would not give effect to

lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the motion judge that Peters’
    motion under r. 57.07 seeking costs of the litigation from Battiston is not
    barred by s. 4 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, and it is not an abuse of
    process.  </span></p>
