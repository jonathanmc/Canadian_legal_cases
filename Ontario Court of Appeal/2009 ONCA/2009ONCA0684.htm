  <h2>I.       INTRODUCTION </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue in this
    appeal is the relief, if any, to which Mary Faye Hamilton, the
    appellant/respondent by cross-appeal, is entitled as a result of problems she
    encountered when she purchased land and hired a builder to build a home for her.
     Jon Osborne, the respondent/appellant by cross-appeal, a co-worker in the real
    estate firm where Hamilton worked as an associate broker,<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> 
    had listed the property and recommended the builder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the project
    progressed, problems developed.  First, the builder, who was to purchase the
    property and then sell Hamilton a finished home on it, did not have enough
    money to close on the sale of the property. Second, the builder’s work was deficient. 
    Third, for a number of reasons, it was not possible for the home to have a
    feature that was particularly important to Hamilton - a walk-out basement apartment. 
    After a small amount of work had been completed in the construction of her new
    home, Hamilton was forced to replace the original builder and build a modified
    dwelling. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central to this
    appeal and cross-appeal is the way in which the trial judge dealt with the
    issues of damages and alleged misrepresentations and breach of fiduciary duty
    on the part of Osborne.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons
    that follow, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal, in part.</p>
  <h2>II.      FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following
    separation from her husband, Hamilton wanted a home with a walk-out basement
    apartment that she could rent out to help defray expenses.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the spring of
    1998, Hamilton’s colleague, Osborne, presented an exclusive listing of a vacant
    lot for which he had a builder; namely, Lou Lacivita, operating through his
    numbered company, 1214125 Ontario Limited (collectively “Lacivita”). The
    information in the listing included the opportunity to build a home with a
    walk-out basement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hamilton investigated the proposal by viewing
    the lot and asking Osborne questions including about the possibility of a
    walk-out basement apartment and Lacivita’s qualifications.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After deciding to
    proceed, Hamilton personally prepared an offer in the form of the agreement of
    purchase and sale.  In the agreement, entered into on May 11, 1998, Hamilton agreed to pay Lacivita $320,000.00 for the home and lot, with a $15,000.00
    initial deposit payable to Lacivita and a further $15,000.00 to be paid when
    the sale of her home closed.  At the time the agreement was signed, Hamilton knew that Lacivita did not own the lot, but that he intended to buy it in advance
    of her purchase of the property and newly-built home, scheduled to close on
    August 28, 1998. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In late June
    1998, Lacivita’s lawyer told Hamilton that Lacivita did not have the $7,500 required
    to complete the acquisition of the land.  Hamilton, in order to salvage the
    project, agreed to advance the money herself.  On June 30, 1998, she purchased
    the lot and assumed a vendor take-back mortgage.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10] Shortly after the
    land transaction closed, additional problems surfaced.  Lacivita had not
    obtained building permits, trades people were not being paid, and the
    municipality had delivered a stop work order.  Later, Hamilton found out from
    the Ontario New Home Warranty Program (“ONHWP”) that Lacivita’s membership had
    expired and that he owed them money. In addition, unbeknownst to Hamilton, Osborne had been in communication with Lacivita’s lawyer about Lacivita’s need
    for $150,000 to assist with construction financing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11] After completing
    only a small percentage of the construction, Lacivita stopped working on the
    home.  Hamilton subsequently hired a new builder.  Once familiar with the
    project, the new builder advised Hamilton that he would have to repair
    Lacivita’s mistakes and that a walk-out basement would be very expensive due to
    restrictions imposed by the Lake Simcoe Conservation Authority and the
    topography of the lot. Hamilton also learned that the property was not serviced
    by either hydro or gas.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12] Hamilton’s agreement with the new builder was
    for a modified home to be built for $308,000, without a walk-out basement
    apartment.  She spent additional money for legal fees and for her new builder
    to correct the deficiencies in Lacivita’s work.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13] As a result of
    these various problems, Hamilton sued Osborne and others.  Her claim against
    Osborne is for damages arising from, among other things, negligent misrepresentation
    and breach of fiduciary duty.  Specifically, Hamilton claims that Osborne
    misled her in relation to Lacivita - his standing with ONHWP and his financial
    strength - and the feasibility of building a home on the property that included
    a walk-out basement apartment.  </p>
  <h2>III.      THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14] The trial judge’s
    reasons contain a detailed analysis of Hamilton’s claims against Osborne on the
    basis of negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <h2>1.       <u>Negligent Misrepresentation</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15] Relying on the principles
    established in <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i>.,
    [1964] A.C. 465, adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Queen v. Cognos</i>,
    [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87, the trial judge noted, at para. 39, that for a finding of
    misrepresentation to be made, Hamilton had to establish that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:200%'>i.        there was a duty of care
    based on a special relationship; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:200%'>ii.       the representation was
    untrue or inaccurate;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:200%'>iii.      Osborne acted negligently
    in making the misrepresentation;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:200%'>iv.      she relied on the
    misrepresentation; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:200%'>v.       the reliance on that
    misrepresentation was detrimental in that damages resulted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16] The trial judge found
    that a “special relationship” existed between Hamilton and Osborne based on
    “dual agency” – both parties worked for the same brokerage firm.  Osborne was
    the vendor’s agent and Hamilton was both the purchaser and the purchaser’s
    agent.</p>
  <h2><i>(i)      Lacivita’s reputation as a
    builder</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17] The trial judge
    found, at para. 44, that Osborne had described Lacivita to Hamilton as a “solid
    gold” builder. This finding notwithstanding, the trial judge rejected Hamilton’s claim that Osborne’s misguided endorsement of Lacivita as a builder was
    negligent.  First, Hamilton had the opportunity to investigate the quality of
    Lacivita’s work on her own terms but made only minimal inquiries.  Second,
    relying on <i>Fraser v. Powell River Real Estate Ltd.</i> (1998), 112 B.C.A.C.
    276 (C.A.), the trial judge found, at para. 47, that the statements upon which Hamilton relied amounted to “broad exhortations” for which Osborne should not be held
    liable.</p>
  <h2><i>(ii)     The walk-out basement  </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18] The trial judge
    then proceeded to consider Hamilton’s claim that Osborne misled her about being
    able to build a walk-out basement.  The trial judge rejected this aspect of the
    claim, at paras. 53-55, primarily because she found nothing in the evidence to
    support a conclusion that a walk-out basement was not possible.  It would
    simply have cost more than originally anticipated.</p>
  <h2><i>(iii)    The basement apartment  </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19] With respect to Hamilton’s complaint that she was misled into believing that there was no legal impediment
    to her building a basement apartment, the trial judge found that Osborne told
    her that a basement apartment could be built.  Based on this finding, the trial
    judge went on to conclude that Osborne was guilty of negligent
    misrepresentation as, to his knowledge, the relevant by-law prohibited basement
    apartments in that area. However, the trial judge, at para. 65, found Hamilton to have been contributorily negligent.  Given her background and knowledge, Hamilton could have taken steps to satisfy herself as to the legality of a basement
    apartment and failed to do so.  The trial judge therefore held Hamilton 50%
    responsible for any damages she incurred as a result of her not being able to
    build a basement apartment.</p>
  <h2><i>(iv)     Lacivita’s financial strength </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20] Turning to the
    issue surrounding Osborne’s representation that Lacivita was financially
    strong, the trial judge found, at para. 89, that while Osborne was negligent in
    making representations to this effect, after June 1998 when evidence came to
    light indicating that Lacivita was in financial difficulty, Hamilton did not
    act reasonably in relying on those representations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21] The trial judge’s
    analysis of Hamilton’s response to becoming aware of Lacivita’s financial
    difficulties is contained in paras. 75-77 and 88 of the reasons, as follows.  I
    set these paragraphs out in full as this analysis was pivotal to the trial
    judge’s assessment of the damages to which Hamilton was entitled.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[75]   When Ms.
    Hamilton discovered that Mr. Lacivita could not come up with $7500.00 to buy
    the building lot, she did not terminate her contract with Mr. Lacivita. 
    Instead, she told Mr. Osborne to prepare a new agreement related solely to the
    house construction which would be signed when Mr. Osborne brought her proof of
    Mr. Lacivita’s financial stability.  With respect, it is difficult to
    understand why Ms. Hamilton adopted this course of action when she knew that
    her Builder was unable to come up with the sum of $7500.00.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[76]   At this critical
    point in the timing of matters, Ms. Hamilton had good reason to believe that
    Mr. Lacivita had financial problems.  However, rather than taking matters into
    her own hands, she sat back and waited for Mr. Osborne to prepare a new
    agreement.  One must ask why Ms. Hamilton did not prepare a new agreement
    herself (since she was clearly capable of doing so) and make it conditional on
    Mr. Lacivita’s ability to provide adequate financial backing.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[77]   If Ms.
    Hamilton had reasonably relied on Mr. Osborne’s representations up to this
    point, surely this was the moment when she would have had some realization that
    it was time for her to make her own enquiries.  When she knew that her builder
    could not come up with $7500.00 clearly her level of reliance on any of Mr.
    Osborne’s past representations would have been shaken.  I agree with the
    Defendant Osborne’s submissions that at this point had Ms. Hamilton stepped
    back and not closed the land transaction, or if she had closed the lot
    transaction and applied to the ONWHP to get back her deposit, her loss would
    have been minimal.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[88]   I find that
    she would not have done anything differently.  She already knew that Mr.
    Lacivita did not have the $7500.00 to close the lot transaction and so she
    proceeded to buy the lot.  It would not have therefore surprised her to find
    out he needed financing to build her home if he did not have $7500.00.  Once
    again, it must be kept in mind that Ms. Hamilton was very concerned about
    timing.  The sale of her own home would close within a month of the date she
    bought the lot and she needed a place to live.  Ms. Hamilton was intent on
    proceeding no matter what warning signs came her way.</p>
  <h2> 2.      <u>Breach of fiduciary duty</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22] The trial judge
    next dealt with Hamilton’s claim for damages arising out of Osborne’s alleged breach
    of fiduciary duty to her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23] The trial judge started
    this part of her analysis, at para. 90, by quoting from Mark Vincent Ellis’s <i>Fiduciary
    duties in Canada</i>.  She concluded that due to the dual agency relationship
    that existed between Hamilton and Osborne, each had an obligation to the other
    to “make full and fair disclosure of all material circumstances and of
    everything known to him or her respecting the subject matter of the contract
    which would be likely to influence the conduct of the principal”: Mark Vincent Ellis, <i>Fiduciary duties in Canada</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Thompson Carswell,
    2008), at p. 5-2.3.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24] Relying on <i>Laycock
    v. Lee &amp; Fraser</i> (1912), 17 B.C.R. 73 (C.A.), the trial judge held, at
    para. 91, that this duty includes an obligation to disclose all facts about the
    property’s value and suitability for the principal’s purpose.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25] Against the
    background of this mutual obligation, the trial judge dealt with all aspects of
    Hamilton’s arguments essentially on the same basis as that involving Hamilton’s claims for damages arising from the various alleged negligent
    misrepresentations, reviewed above.  The only aspect of the claim under breach
    of fiduciary duty for which the trial judge was prepared to hold Osborne
    responsible was with respect to his advising her as to the feasibility of being
    able to build a home with a basement apartment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b>3.       <u>Damages</u></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[26] The trial judge
    found that Hamilton’s damages claim against Osborne was limited by her failure
    to mitigate in relation to the $15,000 deposit she paid Lacivita and by her
    failure to establish causation in relation to damages incurred after June 1998
    when Hamilton learned of Lacivita’s financial difficulties.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[27] Against this
    background, the trial judge awarded damages in favour of Hamilton in the amount
    of $15,005, calculated as follows.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28] Osborne was
    ordered to pay Hamilton one-half of her costs associated with his negligent
    misrepresentation concerning the viability of a basement apartment.   In
    arriving at the amount of $5,005, the trial judge relied on the work schedules
    in determining the cost of restoring the property to vacant lot status when the
    new builder was brought in to build a home without a basement apartment and
    took into account Hamilton’s costs of renting alternative accommodation over
    the additional time to completion resulting from the extra work involved
    restoring the property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29] To the $5,005,
    the trial judge added $10,000 in punitive damages based on her finding that
    Osborne breached his fiduciary duty owed to Hamilton and that he deliberately
    lied to her about the basement apartment.</p>
  <h2> IV.   ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the appeal, Hamilton raises the following issues:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.       Did the trial judge err in not explicitly
    finding fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of Osborne?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.       Did the trial judge err in her analysis of
    Osborne’s misrepresentations?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.       Did the trial judge err in respect of her
    damages award?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By way of
    cross-appeal, Osborne raises the following issue:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.       Did the trial judge err in any other respect
    with regard to her ruling on damages, especially punitive damages?</p>
  <h2>V.      ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>1.
          <u>Did the trial judge err in not explicitly finding fraud or fraudulent
    misrepresentation on Osborne’s part?</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32] Hamilton argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that Osborne’s conduct toward her amounted to fraud or
    fraudulent misrepresentation and in assessing the consequences of his conduct
    “without regard to the relevant legal principles.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[33] Hamilton did not adequately plead fraud
    against Osborne and her failure to do so is fatal to this argument advanced for
    the first time on appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule
    25.06(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> requires that every pleading
    contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the party relies for
    the claim or defence, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be
    proved. Rule 25.06(8) further provides:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>Where fraud, misrepresentation, breach of trust,
    malice or intent is alleged, the pleading shall contain full particulars, but
    knowledge may be alleged as a fact without pleading the circumstances from
    which it is to be inferred.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Lana
    International Ltd. v. Menasco Aerospace Ltd.</i> (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 343, at
    350, Greer J. interpreted Rule 25.06(8) and adopted the following requirements
    from <i>Rahn v. McNeill</i> (1987), 19 B.C.L.R. (2d) 384 at 392 (S.C.), for
    pleading either innocent misrepresentation or deceit:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    pleading, even of innocent misrepresentation, must set out with careful
    particularity the elements of the misrepresentation relied upon, that is:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>1.       the
    alleged misrepresentation itself,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>2.       when, where, how, by whom and to
    whom it was made,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>3.       its
    falsity,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>4.       the
    inducement,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>5.       the intention that the plaintiff
    should rely upon it,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>6.       the alteration by the plaintiff of
    his or her position relying on the misrepresentation,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>7.       the resulting loss or damage to
    the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Of course,
    if deceit is alleged, then there must also be an allegation that the defendant
    knew of the falsity of his statement…. Each of the defendants must know the case that it has to meet.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36] Since fraud was
    not raised in the pleadings and Hamilton did not seek to amend her claim, I would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.  This takes me to the claims that Hamilton did properly advance – negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. </p>
  <h2>2.
          <u>Did the trial judge err in her analysis of Osborne’s statements based
    on negligent misrepresentation?</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[37] I see no error in
    the trial judge’s reasoning that led to her rejection of most of Hamilton’s claim for damages based on negligent misrepresentation.  With respect to the
    quality of Lacivita’s work, both Osborne and Hamilton acted as agents on the
    transaction and Hamilton was fully capable of performing her own due diligence.
    With respect to the feasibility of a walk-out basement, the trial judge found that
    a walk-out basement was feasible and therefore the information provided was not
    inaccurate or untrue.  Whether such a basement could be provided at the price
    stipulated was an issue between Hamilton and Lacivita. With respect to
    Lacivita’s financial strength, I agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that Hamilton should be held responsible for the decisions she made once Lacivita’s financial
    difficulties became apparent.  Hamilton knew in June 1998 that Lacivita could
    not come up with the relatively small amount - $7,500 - to close the land
    transaction; this fact is indicative of serious money problems for a builder
    who was by then building an expensive home for Hamilton.  Notwithstanding this
    clear evidence that Lacivita was in financial trouble, Hamilton chose to
    proceed with the project with Lacivita as builder. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b>3.       <u>Did the trial judge err
    in respect of her ruling on damages?</u></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[38] The most
    significant factor that restricts the damages to which Hamilton is entitled is
    the trial judge’s clear finding to the effect that Hamilton was determined to
    go ahead with the project, “no matter what”.  This finding creates a barrier to
    the recovery of damages incurred after June 1998 when Hamilton first became
    aware of Lacivita’s financial difficulties.  Any losses Hamilton incurred after
    June 1998 must be attributed not to Osborne’s misrepresentations but to
    Hamilton’s decisions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[39] Aside from the costs associated with Osborne’s
    negligent misrepresentation concerning the viability of a basement apartment,
    Hamilton’s only loss
    incurred before June 1998 is the $15,000 she paid Lacivita for the initial
    deposit.  Hamilton submits that the trial judge erred in relying on the duty to
    mitigate her damages in holding that because it was possible for her to seek
    repayment of the deposit from ONHWP, she could not recover the loss.  According
    to Hamilton, her ONHWP claim is akin to a claim against an insurance policy. 
    She relies on law to the effect that the existence of an available insurance
    policy does not obligate the wronged party to claim under it or disentitle the
    party who fails to make a claim under an available policy to compensation from
    the tortfeasor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[40] I do not agree
    with this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[41] The principle
    Hamilton cites, that insurance proceeds are not susceptible to the doctrine of
    mitigation, stems from the fact that they cannot be deducted from tortfeasor’s
    liability: Tetterborn, A. <i>The Law of Damages</i> (London, England:
    Butterworths LexisNexis-UK, 2004) at para. 5.50. This is a well-established
    principle in Canadian and English law.  The history of this principle can be
    traced at least to <i>Bradburn v. Great Western Railway Co </i>(1874) LR 1 Ex
    10, where the English House of Lords ruled that insurance is not deductible
    from tort liability.  As Baron Bramwell put it,</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText>One who pays premiums for
    the purpose of insuring himself, pays on the footing that his right to be
    compensated when the event insured against happens is an equivalent for the
    premiums he has paid; it is a quid pro quo, larger if he gets it, on the chance
    that he will never get it at all. (p.2) </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court in <i>Ratych v. Bloomer, </i>[1990]
    1 SCR 940.  Cory J., writing in dissent (but not on this point), traced the
    issue of deductibility through Canadian law since <i>Bradburn</i> and concluded
    that “despite any
    confusion that may have beset this issue, no court in Canada or England has
    questioned the principle enunciated in <i>Bradburn</i>, that benefits awarded
    under a private insurance contract should not be deducted from damages awarded
    against a tortfeasor.”  <i>Ratych</i>, para. 11.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[43] The rationale for
    this exception is that people should not lightly be deprived of the proceeds of
    their own thrift and foresight; therefore premiums paid for insurance should
    not be used to reduce a tortfeasor’s liability: Tetterborn, at para. 5.26. See
    also <i>Ratych</i> at para. 7.  But this rationale is only applicable where
    insurance premiums are paid.  Hamilton paid no premiums to ONHWP, nor did she
    demonstrate any foresight in gaining access to it.  The guarantee fund was
    available to her by statute.  While her contract with Lacivita included an
    indemnity clause for his registration under ONWHP upon completion of
    construction, it is clear that construction did not proceed to that stage and
    that this payment was never made.  The ONWHP fund was therefore not “insurance”
    in the sense that warranted its exclusion from the doctrine of mitigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[44]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    would dismiss Hamilton’s appeal as to damages.</p>
  <h2>4.
          <u>Cross-appeal:  Did the trial judge err in any other respect with
    regards to her ruling on damages, particularly punitive damages?</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[45] In the
    cross-appeal, Osborne appeals two aspects of the damages award – the award for
    punitive damages, and the amount of $5,005, being one-half of the costs
    associated with restoring the property to vacant lot status.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[46] I start with the
    award of punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[47] As previously
    mentioned, the trial judge ordered Osborne to pay $10,000 in punitive damages
    based on her finding that he breached his fiduciary duty to Hamilton by lying to
    her with respect to the legality of a basement apartment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[48] With respect, I
    do not agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that Osborne had a fiduciary
    obligation to Hamilton.  Although Osborne and Hamilton worked at the same
    agency – and in that sense there was “dual agency” – the listing agent and
    selling agent were not the same person.  Osborne was the vendor’s agent and
    Hamilton served on her own behalf as agent for herself.  Even though real
    estate agents fall within the traditional categories of fiduciaries, the real
    estate context alone does not give rise to a fiduciary relationship in this
    case since Osborne did not serve as Hamilton’s agent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[49] Relationships in
    which a fiduciary obligation has been imposed are marked by the following three
    characteristics: (1) scope for the exercise of some discretion or power; (2)
    that power or discretion can be exercised unilaterally so as to effect the
    beneficiary's legal or practical interests; and, (3) a peculiar vulnerability
    to the exercise of that discretion or power: <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994]
    3 S.C.R. 377, at p. 408; <i>Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources
    Ltd.</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574 at 599 per Sopinka J., and at 646 per La Forest J. 
    In the context of real estate transactions, a fiduciary duty arises where a
    real estate agent has access to confidential information and can exercise
    discretion in a fashion that places the principal in a position of dependency
    or vulnerability:  <i>Valiquette v. Re/Max Realty Specialists</i>, [1997] O.J.
    No. 2677 at para. 35(O.C.G.D.).  None of those factors exist here. As stated
    above, the by-law prohibiting basement apartments was freely available to the
    public. Osborne possessed no discretion or power in relation to the transaction
    that left Hamilton vulnerable. Quite the contrary, Hamilton was an experienced
    agent and broker who had access to the same information as did Osborne. 
    Finally, Osborne was not in a position of conflict with Hamilton; as the
    listing agent, he would have earned a commission whether the property was sold
    to Hamilton or to another purchaser.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[50] My conclusion
    that no fiduciary relationship existed between Osborne and Hamilton
    significantly erodes the basis upon which the trial judge awarded Hamilton punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[51] The only other
    basis expressed by the trial judge is the nature of Osborne’s conduct. The worst
    that can be said of Osborne’s conduct, as found by the trial judge, is that he
    concealed from Hamilton the legality of building a basement apartment – in
    other words, he told her something that a search of the public records would
    have proven incorrect.  This is not the type of “highly reprehensible” conduct
    sufficient to attract an award of punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[52] For these reasons
    I would set aside the award for punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[53] I now turn to the
    award of $5,005. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[54] The award of
    $5,005 based on negligent misrepresentation in relation to the legality of the
    basement apartment is arguably problematic due to the lack of evidence about
    the amount of work, if any, Lacivita had done in relation to the basement
    apartment as of June 1998.   However, it has long been recognized that in the
    absence of an error of law, an award to damages is reviewable by a deferential
    standard.  While the evidence is scant, it was for the trial judge to review
    and determine the award.  I see no error of law or any palpable and overriding
    error on the facts on which the award was based.  Therefore, I would not
    interfere with this award. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[55] Accordingly, I
    would allow the cross-appeal, in part, and set aside the order that Osborne pay
    $10,000 in punitive damage award.</p>
  <h2>VI.    DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[56] For these
    reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal, in part.  The
    effect of this disposition is that I would reduce the award of damages payable
    by Osborne from $15,005 to $5,005. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[57] Based on the
    parties’ submissions at the conclusion of the hearing, I would award Osborne
    his costs of this appeal and cross-appeal, fixed in the amount of $20,000,
    including disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
