  <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant leased premises in a hotel in Smiths Falls, which had been
    operated as Do Little’s Sports Bar &amp; Grill (“the premises”).  In order to
    avoid the provisions of the <i>Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 1994</i>, C. 10 (the
    “Act”), the appellant purported to operate the sports bar as a private club for
    people who paid a monthly membership fee of $4.00.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was prosecuted under the Act and convicted of five
    offences related to the use of the premises for smoking by its patrons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Act prohibits smoking “in any enclosed public place”.  The central
    issue in the prosecution was whether the premises fell within the definition of
    “enclosed public place”.  Section 1(1) of the Act defines “enclosed public
    place” as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“enclosed public place” means,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>the inside of any place,
    building or structure or vehicle or conveyance or a part of any of them,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that is covered
    by a roof, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>to which the public is ordinarily
    invited or permitted access, either expressly or by implication, whether or not
    a fee is charged for entry, or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>a prescribed place</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>Both the justice of the peace at trial and the provincial court
    judge on appeal held that the premises constituted an enclosed public space.  The
    convictions followed accordingly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The matter now comes before us by way of leave to appeal, granted by
    R.A. Blair J.A. on two questions: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)  Do
    the premises regarding which the charges were laid constitute an “enclosed public
    place” within the meaning of s. 9(1) of the Act?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)       Is the definition of “enclosed public
    place” in the Act general, vague, ambiguous and/or uncertain in its scope and
    application?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the premises in question
    constituted an “enclosed public place”.  I further conclude that the definition
    of “enclosed public place” in the Act is not general, vague, ambiguous and/or
    uncertain in its scope and application.</p>
  <h2>THE FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the organizer and operator of Smokers’
    Choice/Non-Smokers’ Choice, a not-for-profit club (the “club”).  Membership in
    the club was solicited by recruiters who approached members of the public who
    were smokers.  The prospective members were given application forms which were
    also available at the door of the premises.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The membership application form, which was signed by the prospective
    member, contained the following declaration:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>AS A MEMBER I AGREE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING
    RULES;</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept second hand smoke at private functions</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will not engage in the use of drugs</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will not permit entry to the general public</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will not enter if intoxicated</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will not jeopardize the enjoyment of other members</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The club was said to have a membership in excess of 500 people from
    Smiths Falls and the surrounding communities, including Ottawa.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No change was made to the interior of the premises other than to remove
    the “No Smoking” signs and place ashtrays on the tables.  The “Do Little’s
    Sports Bar and Grill” signs remained both inside and outside the premises. 
    There was an electric “OPEN” sign in the window.  There were no signs
    prohibiting entry by the public, although one sign advised patrons not to enter
    if sensitive to second-hand smoke.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The operation of the premises was carried out by independent contractors
    and volunteers under the supervision of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Patrons of the sports bar, as before, could purchase food and alcoholic
    beverages.  However, they were also permitted to smoke on the premises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 8, 2006, in response to a complaint, an inspector from the
    Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit conducted an inspection of the
    premises.  He observed that there were no “No Smoking” signs posted and there
    were ashtrays on the tables.  He made a return visit on September 13, 2006. 
    After the appellant refused him entry, the inspector looked through a window and
    saw a person sitting in the bar area while holding lighted tobacco.  He also
    observed tobacco smoke in the premises.  His final visit took place on
    September 20, 2006.  The inspector observed the appellant coming out of the
    premises with a partially smoked cigarette in his hand.  The inspector
    presented his credentials to the appellant and explained that the Act
    authorized his entry for the purpose of conducting an inspection.  Nonetheless,
    the appellant again denied him entry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of his observations at the premises, the inspector laid an
    information against the appellant in respect of five offences under the Act:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)
          as a proprietor of an enclosed public place, he failed to post signs
    prohibiting smoking – s. 9(6)(c) of the Act;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)
         as a proprietor of an enclosed public place, he failed to insure that no
    ashtrays remained in the enclosed public place – s. 9(6)(d) of the Act;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)
        as a proprietor of an enclosed public place, he failed to insure compliance
    with the no smoking requirements – s. 9(6)(a) of the Act;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iv)     he
    obstructed an inspector from conducting an in-spection – s. 14(16) of the Act;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(v)
         he was smoking tobacco or holding lighted tobacco in an enclosed public
    place – s. 9(1) of the Act.</p>
  <h2>THE TRIAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial of the charges proceeded before Justice of the Peace Bartraw
    (the “trial judge”) on March 7, 2007.  The central issue was whether the
    premises were an “enclosed public place” within the meaning of the Act.  The
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It may very well be that you are a member of an
    organization but that does not stop you from being a member of the public of
    the Province of Ontario and the legislature’s intent was to protect members of
    the public of the Province of Ontario from second hand smoke and smoke and that
    is why they have made these laws.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So whether you are signing a membership card or not,
    you are still a member of the public of the Province of Ontario.  You should
    not have to be put into a situation where your health is at risk through
    smoking and that is why they put in these laws.  So clearly when they made the
    definition under sub-section 1 of this Act, regarding an enclosed public place
    and when they say it is covered which is not an issue to which the public is
    ordinarily invited or permitted access either expressly or by implication,
    whether or not a fee is charged, they are speaking of all members of the public
    whether you are a member of a club or not.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Convictions followed and the appellant was fined a total of $3,530.00.</p>
  <h2>THE ONTARIO COURT OF JUSTICE APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal, pursuant to s. 116(2) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 33, as amended, was heard by Justice S. March of the Ontario
    Court of Justice on January 3, 2008.  The appeal judge noted that the trial had
    proceeded on the basis that if the prosecution established the premises,
    operated by the appellant, were an “enclosed public place”, then convictions
    would follow as the other elements of the offences had been made out.  The
    appeal judge adopted a purposive approach to the definition of “enclosed public
    place”.  He also relied on this court’s judgment in <i>R. v. D’Angelo</i> (2002), 8 O.R. (6th) 386 (Ont. C.A.).  In that case, the appellant was
    prohibited under s.&nbsp;161 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> from attending a
    public swimming area where persons under the age of 14 might reasonably be
    present.  He was arrested for swimming in his condominium swimming pool when
    minors were present.  The pool was restricted to the 8,000 members of the
    condominium club.  The court had no difficulty in concluding that the swimming
    pool was a public swimming area.  At para. 19 of his reasons, MacPherson J.A.
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, I turn to a consideration of the purpose of
    s. 161 of the Code.  Section 161 is contained in Part V of the Code which deals
    with, inter alia, sexual offences.  Many of the provisions in this part of the
    Code are designed to protect children from sick adults who prey on them for
    purposes of selfish sexual gratification.  Adopting a narrow definition of
    “public swimming pool” – for example, which excluded such large facilities as
    Wet and Wild Kingdom or Canada’s Wonderland – would be a disservice to a
    particularly vulnerable group in Canadian society.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the appeal judge in this case concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In applying the analysis set out in the D’Angelo
    case, this Court is satisfied that the decision of the Justice of the Peace was
    not unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The SFOA is to be interpreted broadly so as to
    attain the objectives of the SFOA which is to protect people from the hazard of
    smoking, including second hand smoke.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It was clearly open for the Justice of the Peace to
    find that a group of people with approximately 578 members who are prepared to
    accept the hazard of second hand smoke, are still members of the public and
    therefore covered by the SFOA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge therefore upheld the convictions.</p>
  <h2>THIS APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the appellant and respondent seek the leave of the court to
    introduce new material on appeal.  The respondent moves to have the court
    consider the following documents:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)        the
    statement of the Minister of Health of 15 Decem-ber 2004 on the tabling of the
    legislation to create the Act.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)
          the statement of the Minister of Health of 15 February 2005 on moving the
    second reading of the legislation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)
        the statement of the Minister of Health of 5 September 2006 to the Standing
    Committee on Estimates.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>The above statements relate to the intended purpose of the Act
    and the legislature’s intent that the Act apply to legion halls and private
    clubs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, in a responding motion, relies upon a statement made by
    the Minister of Health to the Standing Committee on Estimates on September 5,
    2006 to the effect that the Act was the mirror image of the City of Ottawa no
    smoking bylaw.  Based on that statement, the appellant seeks to have admitted a
    raft of material concerning the Ottawa bylaw for the purpose of establishing
    that the bylaw did not apply to private clubs and by analogy, the Act does not
    apply to private clubs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additional materials sought to be entered into evidence by the appellant
    included: the minutes of meetings of committees of the Ottawa city council,
    various publications of the Ministry of Health and Hansard reports of the
    debates in the Ontario legislature concerning the Act.  He also sought to
    tender in evidence a transcript of an interview on an Ottawa radio station talk
    show with the Chief Medical Officer of Health for the City of Ottawa.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the appellant and the respondent frame their motions as motions for
    the admission of fresh evidence.  In my view, this material is not the kind of
    material that is typically received as fresh evidence, which must be assessed
    in accordance with the criteria articulated in <i>R. v. Palmer and Palmer</i>, [1980]
    1 S.C.R. 759.  The <i>Palmer</i> criteria are properly reserved for fresh
    evidence that goes to adjudicative facts.  It seems to me that we can consider
    this additional material on appeal to assist in statutory interpretation if the
    interests of justice so warrant.  The interests of justice require a
    consideration of the potential cogency of the material, the unfairness, if any,
    occasioned to the other side by receiving the material on appeal and the
    court’s ability to effectively assess that material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the Hansard evidence, the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Re
    Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, has said that Hansard
    evidence is a legitimate source of assistance when a court is interpreting the
    provisions of a statute.  At para. 35, Iacobucci J. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although the frailties of <i>Hansard</i> evidence
    are many, this Court has recognized that it can play a limited role in the
    interpretation of legislation.  Writing for the Court in <i>R. v. Morgentaler</i>,
    … Sopinka J. stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>… until recently the courts have balked at
    admitting evidence of legislative debates and speeches… The main criticism of
    such evidence has been that it cannot represent the “intent” of the
    legislature, an incorporeal body, but that is equally true of other forms of
    legislative history.  Provided that the court remains mindful of the limited
    reliability and weight of <i>Hansard</i> evidence, it should be admitted as
    relevant to both the background and the purpose of legislation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Re Canada 3000 Inc.</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865, Binnie J. relied on
    Hansard evidence and common sense to establish the meaning of the word “owners”
    in s. 55 of the <i>Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act</i>,
    S.C. 1996, c. 20.  In doing so, he referred to the “limited weight” of Hansard
    evidence.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not perceive any unfairness in considering the Hansard material.  First,
    both parties seek to rely on Hansard evidence to advance their case.  Second,
    if Hansard evidence were admitted at trial it is doubtful that either side
    could have done anything more with the evidence than they could do now on appeal. 
    Hansard evidence is not comparable to the evidence of a live witness who would
    be subject to cross-examination and whose evidence is better heard by the trier
    of fact.  It is difficult to see how either side would suffer any disadvantage
    in the admission of this evidence in the Court of Appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hansard references proffered by the respondent support its position
    and confirm the interpretation placed on s. 9(1) of the Act by the courts below
    to the effect that the legislature did not intend to exempt private clubs from
    the reach of the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that the material concerning the Ottawa bylaw would be of
    any relevance or assistance in determining the legislature’s intention
    regarding the definition of “enclosed public place” in the Act.  Also, I do not
    find that either the publications of the Ministry of Health or the transcript
    of the radio interview with the Chief Medical Officer of Health to be of any assistance.  
      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the merits of the appeal.  </p>
  <h2>(i)  Do the premises regarding which the charges were laid constitute an
    “enclosed public place” within the meaning of s. 9(1) of the Act?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I repeat the relevant words of the Act for convenient reference. 
    Section 9(1), the offence section of the Act, provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>No person shall smoke tobacco or hold lighted
    tobacco in any enclosed public place or enclosed workplace.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo>Section 1(1) of the Act, the definition section, reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“enclosed public place” means,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>the inside of any place,
    building or structure or vehicle or conveyance or a part of any of them,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that is covered
    by a roof, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>to which the public is ordinarily
    invited or permitted access, either expressly or by implication, whether or not
    a fee is charged for entry, or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>a prescribed place</p>
  <h2>(a)       The Position of the Appellant</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant concedes that the premises satisfy s. 1(a)(i) of the Act;
    namely, the premises are the inside of a place that is covered by a roof.  The
    sole issue on this appeal is whether the premises are a place “to which the
    public is ordinarily invited or permitted access, either expressly or by
    implication, whether or not a fee is charged for entry” as set out in s.
    1(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant takes the position that the operation of the premises
    constitutes a private club to which the public is not ordinarily invited or
    permitted access.  Entry to the premises is granted only to club members who
    must establish their membership in the club at the door by presenting their
    membership cards.  The premises therefore do not fall within the language of
    the definition of “enclosed public place” under the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the use of the word, “means”, as opposed
    to “includes” in the definition section indicates the intention of the
    Legislature to apply a restrictive approach to the definition of “enclosed
    public place”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant cites a number of cases in support of his position.  He
    places particular emphasis on two decisions of the House of Lords: <i>Dockers’
    Labour Club and Institute Ltd. v. Race Relations Board</i>, [1976] A.C. 285 and <i>Charter v. Race Relations Board</i>, [1973] A.C. 868.  These dealt with
    allegations of racial discrimination and the meaning of “a section of the
    public” in the <i>Race Relations Act,</i> <i>1968 </i>(U.K.), C. 71.  Both
    cases are dated and, in my view, are not relevant to the issue before this
    court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also places considerable weight on the judgment of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Labaye</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 728.  In that
    case, the appellant was convicted of keeping a common bawdy house under s. 210
    of the Criminal Code.  He operated a club that facilitated group sex.  Only
    members and their guests had access to the club premises.  Group sex took place
    on the third floor of a commercial establishment, which was separated from the
    rest of the premises by two doors.  One of the doors was locked with a numbered
    key pad and marked “Privé”.  Only those who were inclined to group sex activity
    were allowed to participate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin C.J.C., writing for the majority, discussed the kinds of harm
    or risk of harm necessary to found a conviction in this kind of case.  She referred <i>inter alia</i> to “the harm of public confrontation with unacceptable and
    inappropriate conduct”.  She further observed at para. 42 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Since the harm in this class of case is based on the
    public being confronted with unpalatable acts or material, it is essential that
    there be a risk that members of the public either will be unwillingly exposed
    to the conduct or material, or that they will be forced to significantly change
    their usual conduct to avoid being so exposed.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>The Chief Justice went on to conclude that on the facts of that
    case, there was no evidence of the kind of harm necessary to found a criminal
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court in <i>Labaye</i> was pre-occupied with what conduct is
    appropriately made subject to criminal sanction.  There is no issue in this
    case of an adequate foundation for a criminal conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that the judgment of the court in <i>Labaye</i> is at
    all helpful in ascertaining the scope of the definition of “enclosed public
    place” under the Act and, in particular, whether the premises in issue
    constitute a place “to which the public is ordinarily invited or permitted
    access”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the common law of trespass to land and
    the common law of privacy assist in the determination of whether the premises
    constituted an “enclosed public place”.  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further questions the lawfulness of the inspector’s entry
    and attempted entry into the premises.  This issue is not before us on this
    appeal.</p>
  <h2>(b)       The Position of the Respondent </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the Act is a public welfare statute,
    designed to promote public health and safety, and should be interpreted in a
    manner consistent with the purpose and objective of the legislative scheme: see <i>Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Hamilton (City)</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 37
    (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent relies on s. 10 of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. I.11, in force at time of offences, which reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Every Act shall be deemed to be remedial, whether
    its immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing that the Legislature
    deems to be for the public good or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing
    that it deems to be contrary to the public good, and shall accordingly receive
    such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best
    ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent,
    meaning and spirit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent notes that the Act exempts residential care facilities;
    psychiatric facilities; facilities for veterans; guest rooms in hotels, motels
    or inns; and scientific testing research facilities from its application.  No
    mention is made of private clubs.  The respondent concludes that the
    legislature would have expressly excluded private clubs if it had so intended.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern approach to statutory interpretation is well known: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Today there is only one principle or approach namely
    the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>See E. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i>, 2nd ed.
    (Toronto, Ont.: Butterworths, 1983); <i>R. v. Bell ExpressVu Ltd. Partnership</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondent that the Act is public welfare legislation designed
    to promote public health and safety.  Such legislation attracts an interpretation
    that is consistent with its objective.  In <i>Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v.
    Hamilton (City)</i> at para. 16, this court said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Protective legislation designed to promote public
    health and safety is to be generously interpreted in a manner that is in
    keeping with the purposes and objectives of the legislative scheme.  Narrow or
    technical interpretations that would interfere with or frustrate the attainment
    of the legislature’s public welfare objectives are to be avoided.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumberItalicLeft0cmFirstline0cm>Similarly, in <i>R. v.
    Timminco Ltd.</i> (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 21 (C.A.) at para. 22, this court said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> is a
    public welfare statute.  The broad purpose of the statute is to maintain and
    promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers
    in and about their workplace.  It should be interpreted in a manner consistent
    with its broad purpose.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read as a whole, the Act is clearly designed to eliminate smoking in
    public places and thus protect members of the public from contact with
    second-hand smoke.  The word “public” is not defined in the Act.  There is no
    attempt to limit or restrict its application in any way.  As I see it, people who
    join the club are as much members of the public as are members of a swimming club
    or tennis club.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case members of the “smoking public” were approached and
    recruited to patronize the former sports’ bar in the guise of joining a private
    club.  While the club was said to be a non-profit operation it ran essentially
    as before, except that admission was restricted to those members of the public
    who paid four dollars a month and accepted the club’s simplistic rules.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the appellant’s position was accepted, everyone who belonged to a private
    club would be exempt from the Act, even if the club chose to operate in a
    public place.  Such an interpretation of the Act would defeat its objective of
    protecting the public from second-hand smoke.  The approach taken by this court
    in <i>D’Angelo </i>supports the proposition that a narrow interpretation of
    “enclosed public space” would be wholly inappropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the legislature had intended to exempt private clubs from the
    application of the Act it clearly would have done so.  As the respondent
    pointed out, ss. 9(7) – (11) of the Act set out a narrowly defined set of
    exemptions from s. 9(1) of the Act.  It is significant that private clubs are
    not included in this list of exemptions.  As indicated above, the statements in
    the legislature of the Minister of Health confirm this view.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the approach which I take is consistent with the approach
    taken by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <i>Albertos Restaurant v. Saskatoon
    (City)</i> [2001] 6 WWR 214.  In the Saskatchewan case the court had the
    opportunity to consider the words “any enclosed public space” in a Saskatoon by-law
    regulating smoking in restaurants.  Thirty-five restaurants brought an action
    to have the by-law set aside.  The restaurants argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that
    although they invite the general public into their premises, they reserve the
    right to refuse entry to anyone they choose, therefore their premises were not
    public places within the meaning of the by-law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that “enclosed public place” was not defined in the by-law and
    the facts of <i>Albertos Restaurant</i> differ significantly from this case.  That
    said, I find the Saskatchewan court’s response to the arguments advanced by
    counsel for the restaurants to be helpful and informative.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>We cannot agree with their
    argument.&nbsp; The term “public place” as used in s. 142 is modified by the
    words which follow: “including...any building or part of a building that is
    open to the public.”&nbsp; The words “open to the public”,&nbsp; in their plain
    and ordinary meaning,&nbsp; include places to which&nbsp; “members of the
    public are customarily invited and admitted” as described in para. 6 of the
    agreed statement of facts.&nbsp; The reservation of the right to deny access to
    anyone, or to remove anyone, does not alter the fact of the general invitation
    of the public.&nbsp; In sum, a place to which the public is invited is clearly
    “open to the public”.&nbsp; If the legislators had intended to restrict the
    scope of s. 142 to places to which the public had a right of access, as opposed
    to a revocable invitation to enter, they would have said so.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>Furthermore, this interpretation
    conforms with the obvious purpose of s. 142: to permit a municipality to
    protect public health by regulating smoking in places where the public gathers,
    and to thereby protect the public from the deleterious effects of second hand
    smoke.&nbsp; To confine the municipality’s power to legislate to places to
    which the public has a right of access would render the legislation almost
    meaningless.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion I am satisfied that the premises in this case constitute
    “an enclosed public space” within the meaning of s. 9(1) of the Act.</p>
  <h2>(ii) Is the definition of “enclosed public space” in the Act, general,
    vague, ambiguous or/uncertain in its scope and application? </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted by Professor Sullivan in <i>Driedger on the Construction of
    Statutes</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham, On.: LexisNexis Butterworths, 2002),
    at 385-386, the vagueness doctrine involves a consideration of “whether the
    legislation can be given a sensible meaning through interpretation, whether it
    provides an adequate framework for resolving interpretative doubt through
    reasoned legal analysis.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded above that private clubs are not exempted from the Act
    and that the premises in issue fall within the definition of an “enclosed
    public place” in s. 9(1) of the Act, I am satisfied that the definition is not
    general, vague, ambiguous and/or uncertain in its scope and application.  In my
    view, the definition of “enclosed public place” in the Act is capable of
    interpretation through reasoned legal analysis.  </p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would answer “yes” to the first question and “no” to the second
    question.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
