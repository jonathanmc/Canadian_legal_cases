    malpractice action involving the treatment of the appellants’ 10 month old son,
    Burany.  Tragically, Burany died of a bowel obstruction approximately four hours
    after he had been examined and discharged by the respondent Dr. Marissa Tucci,
    an emergency room physician at the Victoria Hospital/Children’s Hospital of
    Western Ontario.  The trial judge made adverse findings of credibility against
    the appellants, accepted the evidence of Dr. Tucci, rejected the expert opinion
    evidence offered by the appellants and accepted the expert opinion evidence
    offered by the respondent.  The trial judge found on the basis of the evidence
    that he did accept that Dr. Tucci had not fallen below the applicable standard
    of care.   Accordingly, he dismissed the action.</span></p>

    the trial judge’s adverse credibility findings against them or his positive
    credibility findings in favour of Dr. Tucci.  They submit, however, that the
    trial judge erred in his assessment of the medical evidence pertaining to the
    standard of care and in concluding that Dr. Tucci did not fall below that
    standard.  They submit that the trial judge erred in law in that he ignored or
    failed to address critical evidence and, in effect, failed to ask himself the
    correct question.</span></p>

    trial judge erred in failing to critically assess Dr. Jarvis’ opinion evidence
    that the respondent Dr. Tucci had met the standard of care in the face of the
    evidence that these warning signs were present.  The appellants argue that
    given the presence of the five warning signs, the standard of care for an
    emergency room physician required admission of the infant to hospital for
    monitoring, further investigation and, if necessary, immediate surgery for
    bowel obstruction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We reject this submission for the
    following reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    for judgment must be read in light of the case that was presented to him. It is
    important to note that the argument advanced on appeal differs fundamentally
    from that advanced before the trial judge.  At trial, the appellants urged the
    trial judge to accept their version of what they told Dr. Tucci as to their son’s
    condition when she examined him in the emergency room.  That version was
    radically different from the evidence offered by Dr. Tucci.  The appellants
    urged the trial judge to reject Dr. Tucci’s evidence as to what she was told
    and what she knew at the time of the examination.  Indeed, they invited the
    trial judge to find that Dr. Tucci had lied and distorted the truth.  The trial
    judge’s reasons respond to those arguments, not to arguments that he did not
    hear.  As we have already noted, the trial judge did not accept the appellants’
    evidence as to what took place in the emergency room on the night in question,
    and he did accept the evidence of Dr. Tucci. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, not only did the trial
    judge reject the appellants’ evidence, he also rejected that of the two experts
    they called as to the applicable standard of care.  The evidence of Dr. Crosby
    was rejected outright on the ground that he had misled the court in a variety
    of ways.  The opinion of Dr. Jones as to the requisite standard of care was
    rejected because Dr. Jones is a treating surgeon and not an emergency room
    physician and her opinion was based on the facts as related by the appellants.  As
    the trial judge rejected the appellants’ version of what Dr. Tucci was told in
    the emergency room, he was not prepared to accept an opinion that rested on
    those facts.  We see no basis to interfere with these conclusions.  As a
    result, we are left with only the opinion evidence of Dr. Jarvis, who testified
    that Dr. Tucci had met the requisite standard of care.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Third, the trial judge was aware
    of the five warning signs identified by the appellants as well as other factors
    that an emergency physician should look for in the case of possible bowel
    obstruction.  Dr. Tucci gave a detailed explanation of why she concluded, on
    the basis of her observations as to those five factors and a number of other
    factors that might indicate either bowel obstruction or some other condition, that
    the admission of the infant for further observation was not medically indicated.
     Dr. Jarvis essentially agreed and testified that Dr. Tucci had met the
    applicable standard of care in deciding to discharge the infant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Fourth, before this court, the
    appellants could point to no expert witness who testified that an emergency
    room physician who failed to admit a child for further observation in the
    presence of the five warning signs upon which they now focus would fail to live
    up to the applicable standard of care.  They say that had the trial judge
    rigorously scrutinized the evidence and the extracts from medical texts cited
    by the witnesses, he would have come to that conclusion himself. In the face of
    Dr. Jarvis’s opinion to the contrary and in the absence of an expert opinion in
    support, we fail to see how the trial judge could have done so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Another point raised by the
    appellants relates to the nature or degree of vomiting exhibited by the infant.
    Here again, there was conflicting evidence from the appellants and from Dr.
    Tucci.  The trial judge considered this evidence and concluded that Dr. Tucci’s
    version should be accepted.  The evidence indicated that Dr. Tucci was alive to
    the significance of frequent or bilious vomiting and that she took steps to
    investigate the nature of the vomiting exhibited by the infant – both in her
    own presence and in the presence of the triage nurse – and asked the appellants
    about what they had observed earlier that evening.  She noted that the infant
    was not dehydrated, which indicated that the infant had not been vomiting repeatedly.
     We see no error on the part of the trial judge in finding that bilious
    vomiting, a further sign of bowel obstruction, had not been present.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the end, the appellants’
    submissions all relate to issues of fact that the trial judge determined adversely
    to the position they advanced.  We see no palpable and overriding error which
    would allow for appellate intervention. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The central issue in this case has
    always been the condition of Burany and the symptoms he exhibited when Dr.
    Tucci examined him.  Had the trial judge accepted the appellants’ version of
    his condition at that time, it is likely that they would have succeeded in
    demonstrating that when Dr. Tucci discharged him rather than admitting him for
    further observation, she failed to live up to the standard of care expected of
    an emergency room physician.  However, the trial judge did not accept their
    evidence.  He made findings of fact, fully explained in his reasons, as to
    Burany’s condition when he was examined by Dr. Tucci in the emergency room.  In
    the absence of an expert opinion that an emergency room physician would fall below
    the standard of care in discharging the infant on these facts, and given an
    expert opinion that Dr. Tucci had met the standard of care, we see no basis to
    interfere with the conclusion of the trial judge that the action should be dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, the appeal is
    dismissed with costs to the respondent if demanded fixed at $20,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</span></p>
