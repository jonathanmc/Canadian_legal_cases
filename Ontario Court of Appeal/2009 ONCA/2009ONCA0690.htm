  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     This is an appeal by <span class=SpellE>Sutts</span>, <span class=SpellE>Strosberg</span> LLP, <span class=SpellE>Koskie</span> <span
class=SpellE>Minsky</span> LLP, and <span class=SpellE>Groia</span> &amp;
    Company (“Class Counsel”) from the order of Lax J. dated February 12, 2009,
    wherein she fixed Class Counsel’s fees at $6,300,000, plus $315,000 for G.S.T. The
    appellants argue that this amount is approximately one-half the amount agreed
    upon in their contingency fee agreements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     At the outset of the hearing in this court,
    two members of the class, <span class=SpellE>Rosetim</span> Investments Inc. (“<span
class=SpellE>Rosetim</span>”) and PBMH Investments Ltd. (“PBMH”), referred to
    collectively as “Objector Respondents”, moved to quash the appeal on three grounds.  First, they argued that neither Class Counsel
    nor the representative plaintiffs had a right of appeal.  Second, they argued that the within appeal
    was a “costs” appeal and, as such, leave to appeal was required.  In their final ground of appeal, they argued
    that the conflict of interest between Class Counsel and members of the class
    was such as to render the appeal an abuse of process.  The motion was dismissed without calling on
    the appellants (respondents on the motion).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Sections 32 and 33 of the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992,
    c. 6 are relevant to case at bar. Section 32(2) sets out the following
    requirement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Court to
    approve agreements</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An agreement respecting fees and disbursements
    between a solicitor and a representative party is not enforceable unless
    approved by the court, on the motion of the solicitor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Sections 33(4) and (7) specifically govern
    agreements to increase fees by a multiplier, providing that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An agreement under subsection (1) may permit the
    solicitor to make a motion to the court to have his or her fees increased by a
    multiplier.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the motion of a solicitor who has entered into
    an agreement under subsection (4), the court,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>shall</span> determine
    the amount of the solicitor’s base fee;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) may apply a multiplier to the base fee that
    results in fair and reasonable compensation to the solicitor for the risk
    incurred in undertaking and continuing the proceeding under an agreement for
    payment only in the event of success; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) <span class=GramE>shall</span> determine
    the amount of disbursements to which the solicitor is entitled, including
    interest calculated on the disbursements incurred, as totalled at the end of
    each six-month period following the date of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Both sections contemplate the motion by a
    solicitor for approval of an agreement respecting fees and disbursements
    between Class Counsel and a representative party, as well as for the fixing of
    a multiplier in relation to fees being made by Class Counsel.  The resulting order is a final order of a
    Superior Court judge, from which an appeal lies to this court by virtue of s. 6(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Class Counsel brought the motion which led
    to the order of Lax J.  Although not
    parties to the proceedings in which the motion was brought, they very clearly
    were parties to the motion. Moreover, Class Counsel had a direct interest in
    the subject matter of the motion and the order eventually made. Their status as
    a party to the motion, and their direct interest in the order made, are
    sufficient to give Class Counsel standing to appeal:  see <i>Parsons
    v. Canada Red Cross Society </i>(2001), 11 C.P.C. (5th) 16 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     The moving parties’<span lang=EN-US> argument that the order of Lax J. is a costs
    order simply cannot succeed.  The order
    approves the contingency fee retainer agreement executed on March 3, 2008 which
    set out the fees owed to Class Counsel by their clients, to be paid out of a
    settlement fund.  Lax J. made an order for
    the payment of money to Class Counsel, as well as a declaratory order approving
    the fee agreement.  It is not an order
    with respect to costs payable by one party to the litigation to another party,
    referable to the other party’s legal costs in the litigation.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     There is simply no merit to the final
    ground for quashing the appeal. The alleged conflict of interest between Class
    Counsel and some of the members of the class is utterly without merit. The
    requirement for court approval of any agreement respecting fees and
    disbursements between a solicitor and a representative party resolves any
    concern for potential “conflict”.  It was
    for these reasons that the motion to quash the appeal was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     The nature of the proceeding was
    succinctly described in the motion judge’s reasons at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    2 - 4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Nature of
    the Claim</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Atlas was an income trust that was intended to pay
    trust unit holders regular income distributions and provide them with the
    opportunity for capital appreciation as a result of its ownership of Atlas Cold
    Storage Holdings Inc. (“Atlas Holdings”), operators of North America’s second
    largest temperature–controlled distribution network.  The trust units traded only on the TSX.  Following an investigation that revealed that
    its net earnings were overstated, Atlas announced[,] following the close of
    trading on August 29, 2003, that it would be restating its financial statements
    for fiscal years 2001 and 2002.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Plaintiffs allege that misrepresentations were
    made by Atlas in its prospectuses, financial statements and press releases. The
    defendants in the action are Atlas Holdings and several of its former officers
    and directors; the former Trustees of Atlas, Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“E&amp;Y”)
    (Atlas Holdings’ auditors) and BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. (“Nesbitt”), the
    underwriter of two offerings of trust units during the class period. The causes
    of action pleaded against some or all of the defendants are negligence,
    negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, conspiracy, breach of fiduciary
    duty, breach of s. 130 of the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 5 (“<i>OSA</i>”)
    and declarations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Nature of
    the Settlement</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some of the defendants agreed to pay $40 million in
    full and final settlement of all claims in exchange for a release of the
    claims.  After payment of administration
    costs, a 10% levy to the Class Proceedings Fund and class counsel’s fees, each
    eligible class member will receive the amount of the actual net loss based upon
    the number of eligible trust units to a maximum loss of $4.50 per eligible
    trust unit. Under settlement, there is a claim administration process that has
    been designed so that class members can prepare their claims easily and then
    have those claims <span class=SpellE>processe</span>[d] fairly and efficiently.
    Eligibility and calculation of net loss is determined by the Administrator,
    Deloitte and <span class=SpellE>Touche</span> LLP, and is subject to appeal to
    a Referee.  If the value of all valid
    claims exceeds the value of the settlement fund net of expenses, a class
    members’ loss may be pro-rated.  If all
    valid claims against the settlement are paid in full, the balance, if any, will
    be paid as prejudgment interest pro-rata to each class member receiving a
    distribution up to an amount equal to 17% of their net loss, and the balance,
    if any, cy-<span class=SpellE>prés</span> as the court directs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The motion
    judge reviewed the background of the litigation in detail, both in terms of
    procedure and substance, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 7 - 22 of her
    reasons before beginning her analysis of the three issues before her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The analysis begins at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    7, with the motion judge’s observation that Class Counsel’s fees “are to be
    fixed and approved on the basis of whether they are fair and reasonable in all
    the <span class=SpellE>circumstancs</span>”. Lax J. goes on to state that what
    is “fair and reasonable” must be determined “in light of the risk undertaken
    and the degree of success or result achieved” (citations omitted).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was asked to approve a fee of $12
    million where the base fee claimed was approximately $3.25 million.  The motion judge summarized the amounts
    sought by the three law firms, which acted together in the prosecution of this
    litigation, the disbursements which totalled $434,474.09, with a total base fee
    of $3,226,023.00 (both exclusive of G.S.T.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 49, the motion judge
    summarized the three objections taken by the Objector Respondents to fixing Class
    Counsel’s fees in the amount requested as follows: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.         There was no
    justification for fees in this amount for an action that settled after
    cross-examinations and three days of mediation with no trial, defence pleadings,
    or examinations for discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.         One objector complained
    that his loss was greater than the maximum loss of $4.50 per trust unit agreed
    to in the settlement, and that this should be addressed before approving fees
    and disbursements in the amounts requested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.         The requested fees are
    disproportionate to the settlement achieved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found all three objections valid.  She considered that the representative
    plaintiffs had entered into fee agreements in 2006 and 2007, but that those
    agreements were replaced by the agreement executed March 3, 2008<span
class=GramE>,  effective</span> as of
    February 1, 2004.  Lax J. concluded at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no reason to refuse to approve the fee
    agreement as I am satisfied that it complies with sections 32 and 33 of the <i>CPA</i>.  The retainer agreement was executed at a time when the settlement amount
    had been finalized and the affidavits that have been filed support class
    counsel’s request for fees.  It is
    nonetheless my task to assess the reasonableness of the fee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She then went on to list the factors that are relevant
    in determining the reasonableness of the fee at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    51, including:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(a)       the time expended;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(b)       the factual and legal
    complexities of the matters to be dealt with;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(c)       the degree of
    responsibility assumed by the lawyer;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(d)       the monetary value of
    the matters in issue;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(e)       the importance of the
    matter to the client;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(f)        the degree of skill and
    competence demonstrated by the lawyer;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(g)       the results achieved;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(h)       the ability of the
    client to pay; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)        <span
class=GramE>the</span> expectations of the client as to the amount of the fee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 52, the motion judge
    accepted counsel’s submissions that this was</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… <span class=GramE>difficult</span>, risky
    litigation that was prosecuted against eleven well-resourced defendants in
    which the plaintiffs advanced novel legal arguments that may not have
    succeeded.  The litigation risk was
    exacerbated by the leveraged buyout and the risks relating to collection.  The plaintiffs were largely successful on the
    motions brought under Rules 21 and 25 and class counsel vigorously and capably
    prosecuted the action in preparation for the certification motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Lax J. observed that
    the result that was achieved was probably the best that could be attained in
    the circumstances. In reaching this conclusion, she considered each of the
    factors outlined above, as well as a number of other class action cases which
    considered the use of a multiplier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge ultimately concluded that the 7,400
    docketed hours for a three day pleadings motion, preparation for a
    certification motion that was never argued, which included 12 days of
    cross-examination, and <span class=GramE>a three</span> day mediation was not
    justified. She further held that the base fee of $3.25 million was not a
    reasonable base fee for the work that was performed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge applied the proper test in
    considering the relevant factors enumerated above at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    14 and in concluding that a 25% reduction in the base fee was warranted. It was
    her call to make.  Absent any palpable
    and overriding error, of which none have been demonstrated, it is not for this
    court to interfere.  As noted by Goudge
    J.A. in <i>Gagne v. <span class=SpellE>Silcorp</span> Ltd. </i>(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 417(C.A.) at p. 425, “the selection of [a] precise
    multiplier is an art, not a science”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge considered the submissions of Class Counsel,
    including their argument that this “was the third largest securities class
    action settlement in Canadian history.” On the basis of the authorities
    submitted by the parties, Lax J. concluded that if the Atlas Settlement was the
    third largest, then it was quite a distant third.  She compared the results achieved in the only
    shareholder approval decisions cited to her, including, <span class=SpellE><i>Mondor</i></span><i> v. Fisherman</i> (2002), 22 C.P.C. (5th) 346 (Ont. S.C.) and <span
class=SpellE><i>Frohlinger</i></span><i> v. Nortel Networks Corp</i>., [2007] 40 C.P.C.
    (6th) 62 (Ont. S.C.).  She concluded that
    the amount sought for fees in the case before her, compared with those cases,
    “could represent up to 52% of the net recovery” and that “[t]his offends the
    principle of proportionality”.  Her
    conclusion is supported by several authorities, including the words of Cumming
    J. in <span class=SpellE><i>Vitapharm</i></span><i> Canada Ltd. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</i>.,
    [2005] O.J. No. 1117 at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 112:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was argued in the course of submissions that the
    implicit multiplier of about 2.26 upon the base fee is modest and a higher
    multiple would be supportable.  In my
    view, the implicit multiplier applied to the base fee is one standard to
    measure whether the fees sought are fair and reasonable. The $15 million sought
    for fees is reasonable if the actual recovery is $100 million … The results
    achieved, i.e. the actual recovery, is a seminal factor in determining fair and
    reasonable fees in any class action settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those words have been effectively approved by this
    court in <i>Gagne v. Silcorp Ltd</i>., <i>supra</i>, where Goudge J.A. at p. 425
    wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the end, three considerations must yield a
    multiplier that, in the words of s. 33(7<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), results
    in fair and reasonable compensation to the solicitors.  One yardstick by which this can be tested is
    the percentage of gross recovery that would be represented by the multiplied
    base fee.  If the base fee as multiplied
    constitutes an excessive proportion of the total recovery, the multiplier might
    well be too high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the motion judge erred in dismissing
    their submission that they achieved a percentage recovery for the class that is
    more than six time greater than the average recovery of $5 million in U.S. securities
    class action settlements. I concur with Lax. J.’s conclusion, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 59 of her reasons, that this line of argument is
    irrelevant.  In my view, the appellants’
    submission could be of little or no assistance to the motion judge.  Her obligation was to determine <span
class=GramE>what was a fair and reasonable fee on the specific facts of the
    case before her</span> and averages from another jurisdiction do not assist in
    that determination. She considered <span class=SpellE><i>Mondor</i></span>, <i>supra</i>,
    being factually similar and from this jurisdiction, to be more relevant and I
    agree with her conclusion in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She did not ignore the fee agreement, but rather considered
    it as she was bound to do. She was not obliged to accept it.  That agreement is but one factor which “can”
    be considered “in determining what is fair and reasonable”:  see <i>Gagne
    v. <span class=SpellE>Silcorp</span> Ltd., supra</i>, p. 425.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then considered the multiplier, noting
    correctly that “[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]t is extremely rare to find a case
    where a multiplier of 3.7 or 4 has been awarded”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, she considered all of the required factors in
    coming to her conclusion of what a fair and reasonable fee would be in all the
    circumstances. Her conclusion is well summarized at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    54 of her reasons, where she states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe that it is important to encourage
    experienced counsel to take on meritorious cases that are tough and this is
    particularly so in shareholder class actions, which are really in their infancy
    in Canada.  I accept that the result
    achieved was probably the best that could be achieved in <span class=GramE>the  circumstances</span>.  I accept that the risks were great, although perhaps
    not as great as counsel contend.  I do
    not, for example, accept that this was a “bet your firm” litigation referred to
    in <i>Endean v. Canadian Red Cross Society</i>,
    [2000] B.C.J. [N<span class=GramE>]o</span>. 1254.  The risks were spread across three firms and
    support was obtained from the Class Proceedings Fund. The members of the class
    counsel team are very experienced, very creative and they did a thorough and
    diligent job.  They are deserving of
    being fairly compensated at a level significantly above an amount that might be
    considered a reasonable base fee given the risks involved.  However, I do not believe that the base fee
    of $3.25 million is reasonable or that the requested fee of $12 million,
    representing 30% of the gross recovery and a much greater percentage of the net
    recovery is fair and reasonable.  In my
    opinion, it is excessive in relation to the recovery for the class.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with her conclusion and specifically endorse
    her observation that the risks here were not as great as counsel <span
class=GramE>contend</span>, nor were the complexities.  The settlement was completed by way of
    contribution from the insurers of the directors and officers of Atlas, and did
    not come from the deep-pocketed defendants, against whom the risk of obtaining
    judgment was much greater.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the motion judge’s finding
    that the multiplier chosen would create “more than adequate incentive” to
    prosecute actions of this kind was an error in principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be no doubt that the motion judge was alive
    to need for fees to provide the necessary economic incentive to encourage
    lawyers to take these cases on and prosecute them.  At paragraph 54 of her reasons she stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe that it is important to encourage
    experienced counsel to take on meritorious cases that are tough and this is
    particularly so in shareholder class actions, which are really in their infancy
    in Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court noted in <i>Gagne</i>, <i>supra</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, fair and reasonable compensation must be
    sufficient to provide real economic incentive to solicitors in the future to
    take on this sort of case and to do it well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge accepted that the members of the class
    counsel team were very experienced, very creative and that they did a thorough
    and diligent job and were “<span class=GramE>…  deserving</span> of being fairly compensated at a level significantly
    above an amount that might be considered a reasonable base fee given the
    risks.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The base fee claimed for all three firms on the basis
    of their dockets was $3.23 million which represented an expenditure of some
    7,400 hours of docketed time at counsel’s full billing rates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reducing the base fee by 25%, the motion judge
    applied a multiplier of 2.6 and concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I consider this to be not only at the higher end of
    the range, but more than adequate incentive to prosecute actions of this
    kind.  This produces a fee of $6,290,746
    rounded to $6.3 million and represents roughly 16% of gross recovery and a more
    equitable sharing of net recovery as between class members and class counsel.
    This falls within the range of percentages of gross recovery <span class=GramE>that
    have</span> been accepted in other cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even after the 25% reduction, the approved fee
    represents nearly twice the full docketed fee.  I agree with the motion judge’s observation that a fee in this range
    would be more than adequate incentive to solicitors to take on and prosecute an
    action of this nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, I see no error on the part of the motion
    judge. She considered all the relevant factors and applied the proper legal
    authorities.  There is no basis to
    interfere with her decision. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of the oral submissions, counsel for the
    appellants began with an argument based on the interpretation of the statutory
    language in ss. 32 and 33 of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act</i>. It was argued that once the motion judge approved the fee
    agreement under s. 32(2), she had no jurisdiction to go on and test the
    reasonableness of the fees in accordance with s. 33 of the Act.  Counsel argued that a declaration proclaiming
    the agreement enforceable took it outside the specific constraints of s. 33.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument was not made before the motion judge, nor
    was it set out in the Notice of Appeal or referred to in the appellants’ factum.  Counsel for the respondents on the appeal
    contend that they had not had adequate notice of this argument and that it
    should not be permitted to proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there is much merit in the respondents’ position,
    in the course of oral argument, counsel for the appellants acknowledged that,
    regardless of the interpretation of ss. 32 and 33, at some point the motion
    judge was obliged to assess the reasonableness and fairness of the amount
    claimed by Class Counsel.  Counsel
    further acknowledged that whether it was under s. 32 or s. 33, the motion judge
    had to determine whether the fee amount produced by the terms of the fee agreement
    was within the range of what was reasonable and fair.  In my view, it follows that if the judge
    decided it was not fair and reasonable, she had authority under either s. 32 or
    s. 33 to determine what a reasonable amount was.  Regardless of what interpretation may be
    placed on ss. 32 and 33, the reasonableness and fairness of the fees must be
    addressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above it is both unnecessary
    and inappropriate to address the merits of the statutory interpretation of s.
    32 and s. 33 put forward in oral argument by counsel for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of argument, counsel for the
    appellants submitted that in his view, the Objector Respondents, who appeared
    and participated in the appeal, should be entitled to their costs of the appeal,
    irrespective of the result, on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the all
    inclusive sum of $10,000 each.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the appellants were successful on the appeal, those
    costs should be payable out of the settlement fund.  If unsuccessful, those costs should be paid by
    Class Counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Objector Respondents did not have their cost
    outlines available at the conclusion of argument.  Bills of costs were subsequently submitted by
    Mr. Fellowes on behalf of <span class=SpellE>Rosetim</span> and by Mr. Foster
    on behalf of PBMH.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fellowes claims costs of $112,976.79, on a full
    indemnity scale, for 134 hours at $800 per hour. Mr. Foster claims costs of
    $89,464.73, on a full indemnity scale, for 104.7 hours at $800 per hour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a somewhat unusual turn, also subsequent to the
    completion of oral argument, the court received a letter from a Mr. Peter Hyde,
    who describes himself as President and director of PBMH, claiming additional
    personal costs for his attendances and time spent in assisting Messrs. Fellowes
    and Foster, including travel costs and incidental related expenses, in the
    total sum of $8,929.96.   It was always
    the understanding that Mr. Foster was counsel to PBMH and it was that
    corporation that was the member of the class, not him.  Costs cannot be claimed both on behalf of the
    corporation and on behalf of the directors and/or officers individually unless they
    are parties in their personal capacity. There can be but one set of costs for
    PBMH.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the amounts claimed by the Objector
    Respondents are excessive.  While
    entitled to be present and make the arguments, in my view, they should not be
    entitled to claim fees separately.  Their
    interests were those of the class and the same objections applied to all
    members of that class. They were, in effect, representational of some of the members
    of the class although not the representative plaintiffs.  In such circumstances, it seems fair that only
    one set of costs be awarded.  I see no
    reason why costs should be on anything other than a partial indemnity scale,
    and, on that basis, I would fix costs of the Objector Respondents in the sum of
    $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., to be paid by Class Counsel.</p>
