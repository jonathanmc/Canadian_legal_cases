  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, defendants in a medical malpractice action, appeal from
    the motion judge’s order granting the plaintiffs leave to amend the statement
    of claim to substitute the name “S. Graham” in place of “P. Ferner” on the
    basis of misnomer.  The motion judge’s order permitting the amendment rendered
    moot Dr. Ferner’s motion for summary judgment that was scheduled to be heard on
    the same day. The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in allowing the
    plaintiffs’ application in view of the plaintiffs’ extraordinary delay in applying
    to correct the misnomer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal because there is no basis to interfere with the
    motion judge’s exercise of his discretion under rule 5.04(2), <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O 1990, Reg. 194 (the “<i>Rules</i>”), to allow the
    plaintiffs’ application absent prejudice to the appellants that could not be
    compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs, family members of Mr. John Ormerod, commenced a medical
    negligence action in relation to his death on July 9, 2001.  According to the
    statement of claim issued June 27, 2002, Mr. Ormerod, after injuring himself while
    lifting and pushing a canoe, was first treated by his family practitioner, the
    defendant Ian K. Ferguson.  Dr. Ferguson prescribed muscle relaxants.  Three
    days later, Mr. Ormerod experienced severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea.  He
    went to the emergency department of the defendant Strathroy Hospital on June
    25, 2001 and was later discharged.  Mr. Ormerod’s symptoms continued.  He re-attended
    at the emergency department of the Strathroy Hospital and was admitted there,
    then was sent to St. Joseph’s Hospital in London for a CT scan.  St. Joseph’s
    Hospital transferred Mr. Ormerod to the Victoria Hospital Campus of the London
    Health Sciences Centre, where emergency surgery was performed.  He died of
    multi-organ failure on July 9, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statement of claim names as defendants the three hospitals and the
    several doctors who attended to Mr. Ormerod.  The radiologist who conducted
    abdominal views, X-rays and a CT scan and reported they were normal on June 28,
    2001, was named as “John Doe”. “P. Ferner” is included as a named defendant and
    identified as the emergency doctor who saw Mr. Ormerod on June 25, 2001. The
    statement of claim alleges that at the emergency department, Mr. Ormerod “advised
    hospital staff and emergency doctor (Dr. P.  Ferner), of the history and of his
    complaints”.  It goes on to allege that “Dr. P. Ferner, the emergency physician
    discharged [him]...”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact is that Dr. P. Ferner did not treat Mr. Ormerod at all.  The
    emergency department doctor who saw him on June 25 was Dr. S. Graham.  Evidently,
    the confusion arose because the hospital’s emergency department record shows
    Dr. Ferner’s typed name with a single stroke through it and hard to decipher handwriting
    beside it that is Dr. Graham’s name. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ferner, in his statement of defence delivered on June 4, 2003,
    pleaded that he did not treat Mr. Ormerod and that Mr. Ormerod was treated by
    another emergency room physician. In his examination for discovery held on
    December 14, 2004, Dr. Ferner explained that his name only appeared on the
    patient’s chart as a result of hospital administration procedures, and that Mr.
    Ormerod had been seen by Dr. S. Graham.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At discoveries, the plaintiffs also learned that the radiologist named “John
    Doe” in the statement of claim was Dr. Bennett. They brought a motion to add
    Dr. Bennett as a defendant in the action and to correct the name of the
    defendant, St. Joseph Health Services Association, to its proper name St.
    Joseph’s Health Care London.  The order permitting these amendments was granted
    on November 8, 2005.  As will be discussed later, the appellants lay emphasis
    on the fact that the plaintiffs chose not to include a request to replace Dr.
    Ferner with Dr. Graham in this motion and took no action to do so for the next
    two and a half years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After more than two and a half years, Dr. Ferner brought a motion for
    summary judgment that was served on July 15, 2008. Two days later, on July 17, 2008,
    the plaintiffs served an expert report of a pathologist and in their covering
    letter indicated that, on the basis of the report, they intended to “add Dr.
    Graham” to the action. The plaintiffs then brought their motion to “amend the
    Statement of Claim to substitute the name of the defendant, Dr. Ferner misnamed
    as a party, with the correct naming of the defendant, Dr. Graham, along with
    other more specific allegations of negligence and increased prayer for relief”.
    Both motions came before the motion judge on September 19, 2008.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Decision of the motion judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge heard and determined the plaintiffs’ motion first. He
    granted leave to the plaintiffs to amend the statement of claim as the
    plaintiffs requested. This rendered Dr. Ferner’s summary judgment motion moot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge began his reasons by setting out rule 5.04(2), which
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At any stage of a proceeding the court may by order
    add, delete or substitute a party or correct the name of a party incorrectly
    named, on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could not
    be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge first rejected the appellants’ argument that in reality
    the plaintiffs’ motion was not one to correct a misnomer but one to add Dr.
    Graham after the expiration of limitation periods. The appellants relied upon
    the test stated by Devlin J. in <i>Davies v. Elsby Brothers Ltd.</i>, [1960] 3 All
    E.R. 672 at p. 676:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The test must be: How would a reasonable person
    receiving the document take it? If, in all the circumstances of the case and
    looking at the document as a whole, he would say to himself: “Of course it must
    mean me, but they have got my name wrong”, then there is a case of me a
    misnomer. If, on the other hand, he would say: “I cannot tell from the document
    itself whether they meet me or not and I shall have to make inquiries”. Then it
    seems to me that one is getting beyond the realm of misnomer. <i>One of the
    factors</i> <i>which must operate on the mind of the recipient of a document,
    and which operates in this case, is whether there is or is not another entity
    to whom the description on the writ might refer</i>. [Emphasis that of the
    motion judge]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then observed that the “reasonable person receiving the
    document” or the “recipient of the document” referred to in the <i>Davies v.
    Elsby Brothers Ltd. </i>test is not restricted to Dr. Graham. Rather, the cases
    have expanded the test to include the “relevant person” who reviews the
    document.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an illustration, the motion judge cited the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    decision in <i>Ladouceur v. Howarth</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 111.  In that case a
    writ mistakenly named the father of the intended plaintiff.  The Supreme Court held
    that the mistake was a misnomer.  It was significant that the insurance company
    of the defendant knew who had been the intended plaintiff.  Spence J., writing
    for the Court, viewed the knowledge of the defendant’s insurer as much more
    important than the defendant’s own knowledge.  He asked what would have been in
    the mind of the insurance company representative when he received the writ.  Upon
    receiving the writ, the insurer would certainly have known that the plaintiff
    had been simply misnamed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the logic of <i>Ladouceur</i>, the motion judge included Dr.
    Ferner, his insurer and his counsel as “relevant persons” as recipients of the statement
    of claim. These persons would have known a mistake had been made and that the
    plaintiffs had taken the wrong name from the emergency record of the Strathroy
    Hospital.  Dr. Ferner’s insurer and his solicitors knew that the “litigating
    finger” was pointed at the physician who saw the plaintiff at the hospital on
    June 25, 2001.  Further, Dr. Ferner knew or could easily have discovered that
    it was Dr. Graham who was the intended defendant. The motion judge observed
    that Dr. Graham and Dr. Ferner have the same insurer and solicitors. The motion
    judge concluded that “the ‘litigating finger’ pointed at Dr. Graham and she
    would have known this, Dr. Ferner did know it and likewise, their
    representatives in this litigation knew it.<span lang=EN-US>”</span>  Consequently,
    the motion judge concluded that this was a case of misnomer and not a case of
    adding a new party. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge turned to the appellants’ second argument — that the replacement
    of Dr. Ferner’s name with Dr. Graham’s should not be permitted because the
    plaintiffs had not been diligent in moving to correct the misnomer. The
    appellants argued that six years had passed since the issuance of the statement
    of claim and almost four years had passed since Dr. Ferner’s examination for discovery
    at which he had sworn it was Dr. Graham who was the emergency doctor who
    treated Mr. Ormerod.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge recognized that there had been the passage of a great
    deal of time but proceeded on the understanding that “inordinate delay is not a
    reason for refusing to substitute unless the defendant to be substituted did
    not have timely notice of the claim and will be unduly prejudiced in preparing
    a defence to the claim.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As there was no prejudice alleged other than the passage of time, the motion
    judge granted leave to the plaintiffs to replace the defendant P. Ferner with
    S. Graham and make the other changes to the statement of claim they had
    requested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants, P. Ferner, T. Tigclelaar, J. Maxted, Ian K. Ferguson, D.
    Gray, and S. Graham appeal to this court.  There is no issue as to this court’s
    jurisdiction to deal with the appeal as the motion judge’s order is final as
    far as P. Ferner and S. Graham are concerned.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants first submit that the motion judge erred by finding that
    this is a case of misnomer. Second, they submit that if this is a case of
    misnomer, the trial judge should not have permitted its correction in the
    circumstances. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Misnomer</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely on Lord Devlin’s test in <i>Davies v. Elsby Brothers,
    Ltd</i>. They argue that had Dr. Graham been served with the statement of claim
    she would not have said to herself upon her looking at the document “Of course
    it must mean me, but they have got my name wrong”. The appellants point out
    that the statement of claim was issued more than one year after Dr. Graham saw
    Mr. Ormerod in the emergency department. They submit that a reasonable person
    in Dr. Graham’s position would not have remembered Mr. Ormerod’s attendance at
    the emergency department. They observe that Mr. Ormerod reported general
    run-of-the-mill symptoms. There was nothing unusual or exceptional about his
    case to make it stand out in the mind of a reasonable emergency physician. They
    submit that the only conclusion is that a reasonable person in Dr. Graham’s
    position, upon receiving the statement of claim, would have no reason to think
    that Dr. Ferner had not been correctly named. Without doubt, they say, Dr.
    Graham would have had to make inquiries in order to discover that she was the
    real target of the litigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Davies v. Elsby Brothers, Ltd</i>., the English Court of Appeal
    did indeed take a narrow view of what fell within the scope of a “misnomer”. 
    The correction sought in that case, to change “Elsby Brothers (a firm)” to
    “Elsby Brothers Ltd.” was in fact refused.  Since both entities existed, the
    court found that it was not a case of misnomer.  However, the law has evolved a
    great deal since the <i>Davies</i> case was decided in 1960.  This court
    recently summarized the current approach at para. 4 of<i> Lloyd v. Clark,</i> [2008]
    O.J. No. 1682:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The case law amply
    supports the proposition that where there is a coincidence between the
    plaintiff’s intention to name a party and the intended party’s knowledge that
    it was the intended defendant, an amendment may be made despite the passage of
    the limitation period to correct the misdescription or misnomer. See <i>Ladouceur
    v. Howarth</i>, [1973] S.C.J. No. 120 (S.C.C.); <i>Kitcher v. Queensway General
    Hospital, </i>[1997] O.J. No. 3305 (C.A.) and <i>J.R. Sheet Metal &amp;
    Manufacturing Ltd. V. Prairie Rose Wood Products</i>, [1986] A.J. No. 7 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found the facts before him to be indistinguishable from
    those in <i>Spirito v. The Trillium Health Centre,</i> 2008 ONCA 762, (O.C.A). 
    In <i>Spirito</i> this court upheld the decision of the motion judge allowing
    the replacement of pseudonyms with the names of the initially unknown doctors
    who were the intended defendants.  The motion judge had found that the unknown doctors
    identified by the pseudonyms Doctors AB and CD would have known that the
    litigating finger pointed at them. Therefore, she concluded the defendant
    doctors had been simply misnamed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought to distinguish <i>Spirito</i> on the facts.  They
    argued that the medical treatment of the patient in <i>Spirito</i> was highly
    unusual.  The doctors would therefore have remembered the unusual treatment and
    known from the details in the statement of claim that they were the intended
    defendants.  In this case, the appellants argued that Mr. Ormerod’s attendance
    at the emergency department was of the utmost routine and Dr. Graham could not
    know from reviewing the claim that she was the intended defendant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a factual argument and must be rejected according to the
    findings of the motion judge.  The motion judge found that Dr. Graham  would
    have known the litigating finger pointed at her.  He reached this conclusion
    after pointing out that in applying the <i>Davies</i> test the court is not
    limited to considering what the litigant would know, but may, in addition,
    consider the knowledge of the intended litigant’s representatives when they
    received the statement of claim.  Here the motion judge relied on the fact that
    Dr. Graham had the same insurer as Dr. Ferner.  Upon receiving the claim, the
    insurer would have had no doubt that the plaintiffs intended to claim against
    the emergency physician who treated Mr. Omerod on June 25, 2001.  The insurer
    would have known or could easily have ascertained that the intended defendant was
    Dr. Graham.  In the motion judge’s analysis, Dr. Graham’s representative, upon
    receiving and reading the claim as a whole would have said “of course it must
    mean Dr. Graham, but they have got her name wrong”.  Consequently, he found
    that Dr. Graham’s representatives and Dr. Graham herself would have known that the
    “litigating finger” pointed to her.  As the court in <i>Spirito</i> observed,
    the finding of what the intended defendant would have known is primarily a
    finding of fact.  This finding of fact led to the motion judge’s conclusion that
    the inclusion of Dr. Ferner’s name in the claim as the emergency physician
    instead of Dr. Graham was a misnomer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that the appellants are attempting to forestall a
    development in the law that has already taken place.  This court has already
    applied the misnomer approach, in three cases<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    in equivalent circumstances where the intended defendants, though not
    personally served with the originating process, were found to have had
    knowledge of the claim when it was issued.  There is no basis to interfere with
    the motion judge’s finding that this was a case of misnomer.  </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Discretion to Refuse to
    Permit Correction </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the naming of Dr. Ferner was a misnomer, the appellants submit
    that the motion judge erred by allowing the plaintiffs to correct it. They
    submit that a motion judge has discretion to permit or refuse the correction of
    a misnomer.  In this case, they say, the motion judge should have refused to
    permit the correction for two reasons.  The first reason is the plaintiffs’
    inordinate delay in bringing their motion.  Second, the plaintiffs, after
    learning it was Dr. Graham who treated Mr. Omerod, made a conscious decision
    not to pursue an action against her and later changed their minds.  The
    appellants submit that the correction should not be allowed in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, after finding that Dr. Ferner was a misnomer for Dr.
    Graham, the motion judge applied the standard that despite the inordinate delay,
    he should allow the correction of the misnomer unless “the defendant to be
    substituted did not have timely notice of the claim and will be unduly
    prejudiced in preparing a defence to the claim.”  The motion judge’s reference
    to “the defendant to be substituted” is unfortunate because in the case of a
    misnomer, the amendment is made under rule 5.04(2) “to correct the name of a
    party incorrectly named”.  The correction of a misnomer does not involve the
    substitution of one defendant for another.  However, his reasons, read as a
    whole, make clear that he viewed the remedy as the correction of the misnaming
    or the misdescription of the emergency doctor rather than the substitution of Dr.
    Graham as a defendant for Dr. Ferner.  The appeal was argued on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The framework put forward by the appellants is correct.  After finding
    there was a misnomer the motion judge had the discretion to refuse to permit
    its correction.  The <i>Rules</i> make this apparent.  Cronk J.A. in <i><span
lang=EN-US>Mazzuca v. Silvercreek Pharmacy Ltd.,</span></i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'> </span>207 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 492<span lang=EN-US>, analyzed
    the wording of the </span>two rules that deal with the court’s authority to
    permit amendment in detail —  rules 5.04 and 26.01.  She contrasted their
    wording to note that rule 5.04(2) uses the discretionary “may” unlike rule
    26.01, which uses “shall”; she also considered the history and development of
    these two provisions.  She said at para. 25:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under both rules, a pleadings amendment is not to
    be made if non-compensable prejudice would result. In contrast to rule 26.01,
    however, the language of subrule 5.04(2) imports a discretionary power rather
    than a mandatory direction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 42 she added that “proof of the absence of prejudice will not
    guarantee an amendment”.  She also cited the discussion of the inter-relationship
    of the two rules in Holmested and Watson, <i>Ontario Civil Procedure</i>, Vol.
    2 (Toronto: Carswell, 1993).  The current edition states at p. 5-34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>the same threshold test applies to a motion to
    amend under either rule 26.01 or rule 5.04(2) and the moving party must
    demonstrate that no prejudice would result from the amendment that could not be
    compensated for by costs or an adjournment; once this threshold test is met,
    under rule 26.01 the granting of leave is mandatory; however, where it is
    sought to add parties under rule 5.04(2) the court has to discretion whether to
    allow the amendment, notwithstanding that the threshold test is satisfied</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the authors refer only to “adding” parties, the permissive “may”
    in rule 5.04(2) grammatically applies to the correction of the name of a party
    incorrectly named in exactly the same way as it does to the addition, deletion,
    or substitution of a party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I see it, as the scope of what the courts treat as a misnomer
    broadens, it is appropriate to take a wider view of the court’s discretion to
    refuse the correction of a misnomer.  A “classic” misnomer, one in which the
    claim contains a minor spelling error of the defendant’s name and is personally
    served upon the intended but misnamed defendant, prompts the application of a
    standard historically developed to remedy mere irregularities.  Now that the
    concept of “misnomer” has been broadened to apply to a wider range of situations,
    the standard used to permit its correction should take into account the extent
    of its departure from mere irregularity in all the circumstances of the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The factors the motion judge applied in this case, whether the defendant
    was misled or was unduly prejudiced, are undoubtedly deserving of the greatest
    weight.  As a general principle, these factors should be determinative.  A
    general principle, however, is not an inflexible rule.  Where the mistake in
    naming the defendant involves more than a mere irregularity or in any
    particular case with exceptional circumstances, the court may exercise its
    residual discretion under the rule to refuse to permit its correction.  It may
    well be that the motion judge took a narrow view of his residual discretion to
    refuse to permit the correction of the misnomer.  However, I am satisfied he
    realized he had a residual discretion since the factors he applied  are broader
    than the rule’s threshold of prejudice that cannot be compensated by costs or
    an adjournment.  While the motion judge in this case might have inferred that
    the plaintiffs, after learning Dr. Graham’s identity, did not resolve to
    proceed against her until July 2008, he did not make that inference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the final analysis, in this case, the motion judge exercised his
    discretion under the rule to permit the plaintiffs to correct what he concluded
    was a misnaming of the emergency physician.  That discretion was his, not this
    court’s, to exercise.  I see no basis to interfere. </p>
