  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Nature of Appeal </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, 1054384 Ontario Limited, a company wholly owned by Constantine
    (Gus) Bassis, sold the property located at 1520 Danforth Ave. in the City of
    Toronto (the Property) to the respondent.  The closing did not take place and
    the respondent successfully sued the appellant for specific performance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two issues raised in this appeal are whether the respondent was
    disentitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance because he had
    “unclean hands” and whether the Property meets the two pronged test for
    specific performance. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Relevant Background and Purchase Agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bassis (Gus) bought the Property in 1994 with help from his
    girlfriend at the time, Liane Samuels, who contributed to the purchase price,
    and it was subsequently transferred to the appellant numbered company. The
    Property includes two bedrooms above the main floor and a basement.  The
    Property had been a bank, so there is a vault on the main floor and in the
    basement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carlos and Christina Caramanda have jointly owned and operated a bicycle
    store, Cyclepath, since 1988 in leased premises two doors down from the
    property in question.  Their lease includes only the main floor of the store,
    so all aspects of their operation are located on one floor.  They have been
    interested in purchasing the Property because of its size and layout, allowing
    them to use the basement for storage and bike repairs.  The proximity of the
    Property to their existing location was another highly desirable feature of the
    Property.  As the trial judge noted, the cycle shop has built up a “strong and
    loyal clientele in the area” and “has become somewhat of a fixture in the
    neighbourhood.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early 2005, Gus instructed a real estate agent, Gruber, to list the
    Property for sale.  After researching comparable properties, Gruber recommended
    that the Property be listed for $600,000 and told Gus that it would probably
    sell for something in the range of $550,000 to $575,000.  Gus told Gruber to
    list the property for $699,000.  Or nearly $100,000 more than the agent’s
    recommendation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Cyclepath owners, who had been interested in the Property for some
    time, recruited the respondent, Christina’s father Philip, to be a nominee on
    their behalf in order to conceal their interest for the sake of their
    negotiating stance.  The respondent was happy to help and was also interested
    in using the vault in the basement in which to store paintings from the art
    gallery he runs in Montreal as well as the apartment above as a “pied a terre”
    when he visited Toronto.  The respondent made two offers to purchase the Property
    at less than the asking price which were both signed back at $698,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To “smoke out” the vendors’ best price, Gruber was asked to have the
    vendors make a written offer to sell the Property to the respondent.  That
    offer to sell was for $698,000, irrevocable until 6:00 p.m. on March 21, 2005. 
    The respondent signed and accepted the offer on March 18 and provided the
    required $30,000 deposit.  The transaction was to be closed on September 1,
    2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed the claim against Gus personally and granted
    judgment against the numbered company. The trial judge found that as of March
    21, Gus had no intention of causing his company to close the deal, and that the
    Cyclepath owners badly wanted to close.  That finding is not contested on this
    appeal. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Respondent’s Alleged Misconduct</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent brought an application for a certificate of pending
    litigation on October 19, 2005.  In his affidavit filed in support of the
    application, the respondent referred to himself as the purchaser of the
    Property, noting that it was “ideally suited to my proposed business,” and
    explaining that he did not want to be specific about the type of retail
    business as this could be economically disadvantageous.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an affidavit in support of a motion for summary judgment for specific
    performance on October 13, 2006, however, the respondent explained that the
    premises would be occupied by Cyclepath, but he did not explain that he was purchasing
    the Property as a nominee.   There was no cross-examination on either
    affidavit.  The motion was dismissed and trial of the issues ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, a number of issues were raised but, as we have indicated, only
    two of them concern us here and we turn to them now.   Before doing so, we note
    that the claim against Gus personally was dismissed leaving the numbered
    company as the sole appellant.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Does the respondent’s conduct constitute
    “unclean hands” such that he is disentitled from the equitable remedy of
    specific performance?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge</span> found that the respondent,
    Silverberg, had no legal obligation to disclose that he was acting as a nominee
    prior to the closing date.  That finding is not challenged on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paras. 116-128 of his reasons, the trial judge discussed the
    complaint that the respondent swore a false affidavit in support of an
    application for a certificate of pending litigation  and the appellant’s
    position that because the respondent had “unclean hands” he could not seek the
    equitable remedy of specific performance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed this argument for three reasons.  First, he
    held that the misconduct alleged must be directly related to the contract
    sought to be enforced and not merely to the general morals or conduct of the
    person seeking relief.  The affidavit and motion for the certificate of pending
    litigation did not relate directly to the contract of purchase and sale in
    issue having occurred long after the contract had been made and breached. 
    Second, the respondent’s conduct was devoid of any intention to mislead the
    court.  The respondent was concerned that the appellant would use the knowledge
    of the true purchasers’ identity to their advantage in any potential settlement
    discussions.  Third, the trial judge found that the respondent’s conduct in
    trying to get out of the deal and as to why they had not closed was deceitful
    and egregious.  Weighing the appellant’s conduct against that of the
    respondent, it would not be just and equitable to deny the respondent the
    relief he sought. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred.  It argues that the
    respondent’s conduct is directly related to the agreement, that there is no
    evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that the respondent had a valid
    reason for not disclosing that he was acting as a nominee after the transaction
    failed to close and that the doctrine of unclean hands is only based on the
    conduct of the party with unclean hands.  While the trial judge found that Gus
    and his father also engaged in misrepresentation to the respondent and to the
    court concerning the transaction, the appellant submits that the doctrine of
    “unclean hands” is not a comparative measurement.  Because the respondent
    misrepresented the facts in affidavits, he has unclean hands and specific
    performance is therefore unavailable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, the trial judge’s conclusion was correct.  None of the
    jurisprudence to which our attention was drawn involves a situation where the
    person with “unclean hands” ultimately confesses.  By the commencement of
    trial, the appellant knew the identity of the purchasers and the
    characteristics that would make the Property unique for the purchasers’
    intended use so it was in a position to assess the extent of its jeopardy.  The
    appellant knew the case it had to meet and the trial was therefore not an
    unfair process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that the alleged misconduct was sufficiently directly
    related to the contract sought to be enforced, the defendants suffered no
    prejudice.  The only prejudice suggested by the defendants was that the
    certificate of pending litigation was maintained up until trial when it
    otherwise might have been removed.  Insofar as the administration of justice is
    concerned, and as the trial judge held, disclosure of the true state of affairs
    would probably have strengthened the case for a certificate of pending
    litigation.  Even if there was no direct evidence as to why the respondent
    maintained his subterfuge at the time he applied for a certificate of pending
    litigation, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference he did that
    disclosure that the Cyclepath owners would occupy the property would weaken any
    settlement negotiations.  Furthermore, the defendants adduced no evidence that
    they could have sold the Property to another purchaser had the certificate of
    pending litigation been removed or that anyone else would have been willing to
    overpay for the property to the extent the respondent had.  The trial judge was
    entitled to exercise his discretion in the manner he did. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Is the Property “unique” so as to support an
    order for specific performance?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, at paras. 130-134, the trial judge correctly summarized
    the jurisprudence relating to the requirement that a property must be unique in
    order for specific performance to be granted.  He then determined that the
    Property satisfied the requirement of “uniqueness” for granting specific
    performance because it was sufficiently suitable for the bike shop,
    particularly because of its proximity to the existing shop, but also because of
    the size and layout features.  Furthermore, he noted that an award of damages
    would be a wholly inadequate result, given his conclusion that the purchase
    price was substantially in excess of market value. He decided that “an award
    for damages would not be fair and just.”  As a result, he ordered specific
    performance.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Uniqueness has both a subjective and objective aspect.  The appellant accepts
    that the Property was uniquely suited for the use of the owners of the
    Cyclepath so that the subjective aspect is satisfied.  It argues, however, that
    the objective aspect of the uniqueness test has not been satisfied on the basis
    that there was insufficient evidence that the Property could be not duplicated
    elsewhere.   Because <span lang=EN-US>the Cyclepath owners were interested in a
    particular area of Toronto, they should have had to provide “tangible evidence
    that there were no alternative stores available in this very precise geographic
    location,” in order to meet their burden of proof on uniqueness.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>We disagree that the objective aspect of the uniqueness
    test was not met.  </span>The Cyclepath owners<span lang=EN-US> had been
    looking for a suitable property in the area for eleven years and had found
    none.  Among the trial judge’s findings of fact regarding the uniqueness of the
    Property and the appropriateness of specific performance, is his finding that
    the Cyclepath owners were willing to offer an amount substantially in excess of
    market value.  The </span>jurisprudence supports the finding that the Cyclepath
    owners’ willingness to pay a premium for the Property is evidence of its
    uniqueness and damages are therefore inadequate.  <span lang=EN-US>The trial
    judge did not err in holding that the Property was unique. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for the reasons given the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is entitled to his costs relating to the appeal on a
    partial indemnity basis, which we fix in the amount of $29,000, all inclusive. 
    These costs are to be deducted from the money paid for the purchase of the
    property. </p>
