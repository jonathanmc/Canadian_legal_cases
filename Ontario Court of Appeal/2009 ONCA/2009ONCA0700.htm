  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 25, 2004, the appellant was convicted by Smith J., sitting
    alone, of eight counts arising out of two separate domestic assaults.  The
    Crown then applied to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender, and on
    December 2, 2005, after a four-day hearing, the trial judge made that order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals some, but not all, of his convictions and his
    designation as a dangerous offender.  I would dismiss his conviction appeal. 
    However, for the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge erred in
    basing his conclusion on the opinion that motivation to change was an essential
    prerequisite to be designated a long-term offender in the face of unanimous
    expert evidence that the contrary was true for this appellant.  I would
    therefore allow his sentence appeal, set aside his designation and order a new
    hearing of the Crown’s dangerous offender application.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2004 the appellant was 47 years old.  Early that year, Victoria
    LeBlanc, then 41 years old, and her two teenaged children moved into his home. 
    She and the appellant soon became intimate.  Both of them were alcoholics.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first incident occurred on May 27, 2004.  The trial judge convicted
    the appellant of assaulting Ms. LeBlanc, by choking her after a violent
    argument in the home.  He also convicted the appellant of assaulting Ms.
    LeBlanc’s daughter when she tried to intervene, and of preventing the daughter
    from using the telephone when she tried to contact the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second incident occurred on June 15, 2004.  The trial judge found
    that the appellant, in a drunken state, assaulted the entire LeBlanc family. 
    He convicted the appellant of assault causing bodily harm for an assault of
    Victoria LeBlanc that he described as brutal and vicious, causing horrendous
    injuries.  He convicted the appellant of assaulting Ms. LeBlanc’s daughter and
    son, each of whom were in the home at the time.  Finally, he convicted the
    appellant of preventing the daughter from calling the police for help, and of assaulting
    a police officer after the appellant’s arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender
    based on the predicate offence of assault causing bodily harm to Ms. LeBlanc on
    June 15, 2004.  Over the four days of hearing that application, the trial judge
    heard evidence of the appellant’s numerous prior convictions, his assaults of
    previous domestic partners and others, and his numerous breaches of probation
    orders over some 22 years.  The trial judge also heard from Dr. Phillip
    Klassen, the forensic psychiatrist called by the Crown who performed the
    assessment of the appellant pursuant to s. 752.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    and Dr. Julian Gojer, the forensic psychiatrist called by the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the trial judge concluded as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With an individual who presents with a record of
    persistent violent behaviour over many years against multiple partners and
    multiple acts of brutality towards them, but presenting as well with some
    sincere demonstration of an attempt to alter that behaviour either by following
    counselling programs or at least obeying Court ordered conditions designed to
    support an altered lifestyle, some reasonable possibility of eventual control
    of the risk of re-offending would exist, but that is not this offender at this
    time in his life.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I regretfully conclude that Gary Cumming has proved
    himself to be a dangerous offender and I so find for the reasons earlier
    expressed.  I have no confidence that there exists, at present, a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control in the community of the substantial risk that
    the accused will re-offend.  The numerous stringent terms suggested by the
    psychiatric experts to provide that control could succeed only with a
    determined, sincere effort on the part of the subject.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. THE CONVICTION APPEALS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not appeal his conviction for the predicate offence,
    or his conviction for assaulting his daughter on June 15, 2004.  In oral
    submissions, the appellant addressed only his conviction for interfering with
    Ms. LeBlanc’s daughter’s attempt to call police on June 15, 2004.  He argued
    that there was no evidence that the daughter had the right to use the phone or to
    enter the room where it was located.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  There was ample evidence that the appellant’s house was the
    daughter’s family home at the time, and that she had access to all the rooms.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the other convictions, the appellant’s factum advances the general
    position that there was insufficient evidence to sustain them.  Again, I
    disagree.  I need only say that all of the convictions are well founded on the
    evidentiary record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction appeals are therefore dismissed.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. THE SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his designation as a dangerous offender.  He
    argues that the trial judge erred in not declaring him a long-term offender
    instead.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not contest the trial judge’s finding that he
    constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of
    other persons and therefore meets that criterion for dangerous offender. 
    Following that finding, the trial judge then went on to consider, as he was
    required to by <i>R. v. Johnson</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, whether the appellant
    nonetheless meets the requirements for designation as a long-term offender set
    out in s. 753.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He concluded that the appellant
    did not, because there was no reasonable possibility of eventual control in the
    community of the risk the appellant presents, which is an essential criterion for
    long-term offender mandated by s. 753.1.  As a result, the trial judge declared
    the appellant to be a dangerous offender.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that the trial judge erred in his conclusion that
    there was no reasonable possibility of eventual control in the community and
    that the sentence imposed was fatally flawed as a consequence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two psychiatrists gave the only expert evidence in the sentencing
    proceedings, Dr. Klassen for the Crown and Dr. Gojer for the defence.  Their
    evidence was very similar.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Klassen’s risk assessment of the appellant was that he is at high
    risk of repeating his history of violent behaviour with co-habiting persons
    absent significant intervention, but that in all likelihood, there will be some
    decline in this risk over the next number of years as the appellant moves into
    his fifties.  Dr. Gojer’s opinion was consistent with this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Klassen was clear, however, that with the proper set of external
    controls on the appellant there is, in the language of s. 753.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code,</i> a reasonable possibility of his eventual control in the community.  Dr.
    Klassen described this as reflecting the shift in recent years from
    institution-based care to intensive community supervision, a shift that he believes
    has proven very successful.  This includes regular or even daily monitoring of
    the individual, including where and with whom he is living and working, and ensuring
    that he is taking his medication and abstaining from alcohol consumption.  Dr.
    Klassen underlined that the appellant has never been aggressively monitored in
    this way.  He emphasized that the whole point of aggressive monitoring is to
    render immaterial the appellant’s lack of motivation to change.  Finally, Dr.
    Klassen said that if the appellant does not participate in the aggressive
    monitoring or, if he does and there are indications that he is proceeding along
    a road to re-offend, he can immediately be re-incarcerated before that happens,
    and charged with breach of his long-term supervision order.  Dr. Klassen
    concluded that this type of monitoring has proven effective, and is available
    in Toronto.  He therefore concluded that it offered a reasonable possibility of
    eventual control in the community of the risk presented by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While somewhat less detailed, Dr. Gojer’s evidence was entirely
    consistent with this.  He concluded, as did Dr. Klassen, that with significant
    external supervision, the appellant met the long-term offender designation requirement
    that there be a reasonable possibility that his risk could be managed
    effectively in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the unanimity of this expert evidence, the trial judge came to
    the opposite conclusion, holding that there was no reasonable possibility of
    eventual control in the community of the risk presented by the appellant.  The
    trial judge did so without articulating any reasons for rejecting it.  Rather,
    as the passages quoted earlier indicated, the trial judge based his conclusion
    on his opinion that for an offender like the appellant, strict external
    controls, however well-fashioned, could succeed only if the individual was
    motivated to change and “that is not this offender at this time in his life”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This opinion is clearly and directly contrary to the expert opinion that
    was before the trial judge, namely that the strict external controls proposed
    would work regardless of the individual’s motivation.  Moreover, the opinion of
    the trial judge that motivation was a necessary prerequisite to controlling the
    behaviour of someone like the appellant was itself entirely without evidentiary
    foundation.  Since the trial judge’s conclusion was directly contrary to the
    expert opinion before him, and since there was no evidentiary foundation for
    the opinion upon which it was based, the sentence he imposed cannot stand.  The
    basis for his conclusion that the appellant cannot qualify as a long-term
    offender because there is no reasonable possibility of eventual control in the
    community of the risk he presents has no evidentiary foundation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentence appeal must therefore be allowed.  Since it has been almost
    four years since sentence was pronounced, it is appropriate that a new
    dangerous offender hearing be conducted so that a current assessment of the
    appellant can be made.  The sentence appeal is allowed and a new dangerous
    offender hearing is ordered.   </p>
