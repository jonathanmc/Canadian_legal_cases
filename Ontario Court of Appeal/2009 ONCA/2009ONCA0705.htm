  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         <u>OVERVIEW</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is about the attempt of a motion judge to deal with a routine
    pleading motion in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  The motion judge
    carefully prepared for the motion ahead of time and called the parties’ counsel
    out of the courtroom into her anteroom to receive her disposition without
    affording them an adequate opportunity to make submissions.  I would allow the
    appeal because the motion judge erred by failing to provide counsel with a
    proper opportunity to make submissions before deciding the matter and because
    she erred in her disposition of the motion. I also find that the motion judge
    erred by failing to hear the motion in open court, but given the other grounds
    for allowing the appeal, I find it unnecessary to consider whether this failure
    would vitiate the decision she made.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal arises out of the appellants’ claim for beneficial title to a
    residential property they had conveyed to the respondent in 1996.  In November
    2005, the appellants filed a claim seeking a declaration that the respondent
    held title to the property in trust for them “pursuant to an implied,
    constructive, or expressed [oral] trust agreement” (the “Agreement Claim”).  In
    the Agreement Claim, the appellants alleged that they had transferred title to
    the respondent to hold in trust for them “temporarily for personal and business
    purposes”.  The appellants claimed that the respondent agreed to hold the
    property in trust and to return it to them when they so directed.  They also claimed
    that they continued to live in the house, made substantial improvements to it,
    paid the mortgage taxes, insurance premiums, and other property expenses, and were
    at all times the true owners of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his Statement of Defence and Counterclaim dated July 18, 2006, the
    respondent denied the existence of both the alleged agreement and the trust.  The
    respondent moved to strike out the appellants’ Statement of Claim.  By
    endorsement dated August 16, 2006, the motion judge struck out the appellants’ Agreement
    Claim, without leave to amend, under rule 21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O 1990, Reg. 194 (the “<i>Rules</i>”), on the ground that it
    disclosed no reasonable cause of action.  In the alternative, the motion judge dismissed
    the claim pursuant to rule 20.01(3) of the <i>Rules</i> on the ground that there
    was no genuine issue for trial.  The motion judge quite properly reasoned that
    a “verbal” trust agreement to re-convey land or a trust in respect of land is
    not enforceable at law and pursuant to ss. 1 and 9 of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. S.19.  Moreover, she properly found that the facts alleged did
    not bring the appellants’ claim within the doctrine of part performance so as
    to permit enforcement of the alleged oral contract in equity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were unable to settle the order following the motion judge’s
    disposition; the appellants maintained that the motion judge had not dealt with
    their claim of constructive trust.  The parties attended again before the
    motion judge in November 2006.  The motion judge gave them an opportunity to
    provide supplemental written submissions based on the motion record originally
    before her as to whether a claim for unjust enrichment or constructive trust
    should survive in light of the capital improvements the appellants claimed to
    have made to the property.  The appellants filed extensive written submissions
    that went far beyond what the motion judge had directed.  They went so far as
    to include additional evidence that was not before the court on the original
    motion, in direct contravention of the motion judge’s directions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge released a supplementary endorsement on February 6,
    2007, in which she confirmed that the appellants’ Agreement Claim was struck,
    without leave to amend.  However, the motion judge generously construed the Statement
    of Claim and found that it could be read as intending to advance a claim based
    on unjust enrichment arising out of the alleged upgrades.  Such a claim,
    however, was lacking in particulars, and was also struck by the motion judge pursuant
    to rule 21 of the <i>Rules</i>, with leave to amend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In paragraph 28 of her supplementary endorsement, the motion judge indicated
    that the appellants’ “claim for compensation or a constructive trust on the
    basis that the defendant was unjustly enriched as a result of the upgrades to
    the property they allegedly made after selling the property to the defendant is
    also struck, with leave to file and serve an <u>Amended</u> Statement of Claim”
    (emphasis in original).  She then went on to give precise direction as to what
    amendments would be permitted.  Specifically, she directed that the Amended
    Statement of Claim:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>shall be black-lined, deleting the Agreement Claim
    and the facts pleaded in the Statement of Claim relating thereto, and claiming
    compensation or a constructive trust based on the alleged unjust enrichment
    arising out of the alleged upgrades of the property. In the <u>Amended</u> Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs shall provide particulars of the alleged
    upgrades, when they were done, their cost, who paid for them and how, the
    amount by which they increased the value of the property and whether the
    defendant requested or approved the particular upgrade or the plaintiffs
    effected the alleged upgrade of their own volition without approval.  [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I emphasize that the motion judge directed the deletion of the Agreement
    Claim as well as the facts pleaded in relation to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 24, 2008, the appellants served an Amended Statement of Claim,
    in which they claimed, for the first time, the right to retain the property or,
    alternatively, compensation, pursuant to s. 37(1) of the <i>Conveyancing</i> <i>and
    Law of Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34 (the “CLPA”).  That section
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a person makes lasting improvements on land
    under the belief that it is the person’s own, the person or the person’s
    assigns are entitled to a lien upon it to the extent of the amount by which its
    value is enhanced by the improvements, or are entitled or may be required to
    retain the land if the Superior Court of Justice is of opinion or requires that
    this should be done, according as may under all circumstances of the case be
    most just, making compensation for the land, if retained, as the court directs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent took the position that the Amended Statement of Claim did
    not comply with the motion judge’s order of February 6, 2007.  On the agreement
    of counsel, the respondent brought a motion before the motion judge on October
    14, 2008, to determine whether, or to what extent, the appellants’ Amended Statement
    of Claim complied with her order of February 6, 2007.  At that time, the motion
    judge was sitting on the Commercial Court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises out of what transpired when counsel attended before
    the motion judge on the motion scheduled for October 14, 2008.  On appeal, the
    parties filed an Agreed Statement of Fact as to what occurred on that day.  I
    set it out in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>AGREED STATEMENT OF
    FACT</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Introduction </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties agree that
    the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear this Appeal. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties agree that
    the following facts are accurate for the purpose of this Appeal. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Proposed amended
    statement of claim</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel for the
    plaintiff prepared an amended statement of claim and counsel for the defendant
    objected to the proposed amendments. Counsel agreed to attend before [the
    motion judge] on a contested motion to determine whether the proposed amended
    claim complied with her endorsements and orders. Counsel for the defendant
    prepared a motion to strike the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendant without
    leave for failing to comply with the orders of [the motion judge] dated August
    2, 2006 and February 6, 2007. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Attendance before
    [the motion judge]</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel attended before
    [the motion judge] on October 14, 2008 for the motion scheduled to be heard at
    10:00 a.m. As [the motion judge] was sitting as a judge of the Commercial List
    at the time, she agreed to hear this motion on her list. At approximately 10:20
    a.m. counsel were asked by court staff to join [the motion judge] in the
    anteroom adjacent to the courtroom. [The motion judge] was seated at a desk and
    counsel sat opposite her. The motion materials were open on the desk in front
    of her with handwriting on the back cover of the motion record. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The motion judge] said
    initially to counsel for the plaintiffs that she was “appalled” at the proposed
    amended statement of claim which clearly did not accord with the terms set out
    in her endorsements. She briefly explained where it was deficient. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before turning to the
    endorsement [the motion judge] added that she was “appalled” by the delays to
    date and the lack of progress in resolving this case. She said she would order
    a timetable for the litigation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The motion judge] then
    advised counsel that she had prepared an endorsement which included a copy of
    the proposed amended statement of claim with extensive revisions that would
    have to be done for the amended statement of claim to comply with her order of
    February 6, 2007. She then read her endorsement to counsel and began to review
    her revisions to the proposed amended claim. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel for the
    plaintiffs objected to the wording of the endorsement and argued that the
    proposed changes precluded the plaintiffs from obtaining a vesting order for
    the property that would allow them to reacquire the property on the basis of
    the alleged improvements. Counsel for the defendant was asked for the defendant’s
    position and had to concede that “in theory” it was possible that the
    plaintiffs to reacquire the property pursuant to a constructive trust, though
    not on the facts of the case as he understood them. [The motion judge] made
    revisions on page three of the proposed amended claim and in paragraphs 11 and
    28 in response to the submissions of plaintiffs’ counsel that specifically
    permitted such a claim. She observed that the facts would be determined by the
    trial judge. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The motion judge] then
    turned to the timetable for the litigation and with input from both counsel she
    set out on a new sheet of paper the timetable that would apply. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The motion judge] then
    reiterated to plaintiffs’ counsel that any claim that the property was held in
    an express trust or that the defendant had a contractual obligation to
    re-convey the property had been struck and that the plaintiffs should not
    endeavour to revisit these areas. There was no argument from counsel on this
    point and [the motion judge] added a paragraph to her endorsement to reflect
    that provision. She then signed the endorsement and ended the attendance. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The counsel were
    instructed to return to the courtroom, where they and Mr. Palkowski awaited a
    copy of the endorsement. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This appeal followed.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues as stated by the appellants overlap significantly.  I have
    grouped their issues into fewer issues, stated differently, and will deal with each
    in turn.  I begin with the “open court” issue not only because the parties
    argued it first but because of its broad importance beyond this case.</p>
  <h3>1.         The motion judge erred in failing
    to hear and determine the motion in public</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent recognized that the open court principle is one of the
    cornerstones of our judicial system.  However, he submitted that the motion
    judge had the discretion to deal with the motion in chambers.  He submitted the
    motion judge’s discretion derived from one or more of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, the <i>Rules</i>, the Superior Court’s Practice
    Direction Concerning the Commercial List, and the inherent jurisdiction of the
    court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 135(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> states the general principle
    that “all court hearings shall be open to the public.”  The general principle,
    however, is subject to s. 135(2) and the <i>Rules</i>.  Section 135(2) gives
    the court discretion to exclude the public from a hearing “where the
    possibility of serious harm or injustice to any person justifies a departure
    from the general principle that court hearings should be open to the public”. 
    Section 135(2) has no application to this case.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 37.11(1) of the <i>Rules </i>sets out the following list of circumstances
    in which a motion may be heard in the absence of the public:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion
    is to be heard and determined without oral argument;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>because of
    urgency, it is impractical to have the motion heard in public;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion
    is to be heard by conference telephone;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion
    is made in the course of a pre-trial conference; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion
    is before a single judge of an appellate court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As can be seen, the rule permits the situations in which, as a matter of
    existing practice, motions are typically not heard in public.   Motions made in
    writing, such as motions for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, are
    permitted by para. (a).  Tele-conference motions are permitted by para. (c). 
    Paragraph (b) provides a judge with discretion to hear any motion in camera
    where is it impractical to hear the motion in public because of urgency.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these circumstances existed in this case.  It is clear that the
    list of exceptions set out in rule 37.11(2) is exhaustive because the rule provides
    that “[t]he hearing of all other motions shall be open to the public, except as
    provided in section 135 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>”.  The mandatory
    feature of this provision is telling — “all other motions shall be open to the
    public”.  This mandatory feature is accentuated by the edict that where there
    is a departure from the open court principle, “the presiding judge or officer
    shall endorse on the notice of motion leave for a hearing in the absence of the
    public”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, neither s. 135 (2) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> nor rule
    37.11(1) of the <i>Rules </i>authorized the motion judge to hear this motion in
    the absence of the public.  Rather, both s. 135(1) and rule 37.11(2)
    affirmatively required the hearing of this motion to be open to the public. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no merit in the respondent’s reliance on the Superior Court’s
    Practice Direction Concerning the Commercial List and the court’s inherent
    jurisdiction.  I leave aside the question whether the Practice Direction even
    applies to this motion that seems to have proceeded before a judge of the Commercial
    Court only as a matter of convenience.  Specifically, the respondent cited the
    following provision from that Practice Direction: “The special procedures
    adopted for the hearing of matters on the Commercial List expedite the hearing
    and determination of these matters and they have met with considerable approval.” 
    This quotation is drawn from the preamble to the 2002 revision of the Practice
    Direction.  The respondent did not identify any substantive provision of the
    Practice Direction that could be construed to authorize the motion judge to
    proceed in the absence of the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did the respondent cite any authority pertaining to the court’s
    inherent jurisdiction.  In any event, neither the Practice Direction nor the
    court’s inherent jurisdiction could permit discretion to be exercised in
    contravention of the affirmative requirements of a statute and the <i>Rules</i>.
     As Blair J.A. observed in <i>Stelco Inc. (Re)</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1171, at
    para. 35, despite the expansive nature of inherent jurisdiction, it does not
    operate where Parliament or the legislature has acted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude that s. 135 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act </i>and rule
    37.11 of the <i>Rules</i> govern when motions are permitted to be heard in the
    absence of the public; both required the motion judge to deal with this motion
    in public.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the opportunity to read the reasons of MacFarland J.A. who
    would find that the requirements of s. 135 (1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> were met because there was nothing in the record to suggest that “anyone was
    excluded from the judge’s chambers.  No one requested that the appellants
    personally be permitted to attend on the motion judge with their counsel.” 
    “Absent some evidence of exclusion” she would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.  With respect, I cannot acquiesce in an interpretation of s. 135 that results
    in the conclusion that this motion was “open to the public”.  The words “open
    to the public” should be given the ordinary grammatical sense that best accords
    with the statutory purpose of s. 135.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 135 is the embodiment of the open court principle, a fundamental
    canon of our legal system.  The Supreme Court of Canada has discussed its purpose
    on many occasions.  Recently in <i>Application to proceed in camera, Re</i>,
    2007 CarswellBC 2418, 2007 SCC 43, Bastarache J. (McLachlin C.J.C., Binnie,
    Deschamps, Fish, Abella, Charron and Rothstein JJ. concurring), drawing on
    earlier decisions of the court<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    explained the open court principle’s value and function in some detail at
    paras. 31-34.  He reiterated that the open court principle is a “hallmark of a
    democratic society,” long recognized as a “cornerstone of the common law”.  Bastarache
    J. then recalled Bentham’s powerful assertion that “Publicity is the very soul
    of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion, and the surest of all guards
    against improbity” (J. H. Burton, ed., Benthamiana: Or, Select Extracts from
    the Works of Jeremy Bentham (1843), p. 115).  Bastarache J. further underscored
    the fact that a critical purpose of the open court principle is to encourage
    the courts to function in a manner that the public approves: “An open court is
    more likely to be an independent and impartial court.  Justice seen to be done
    is in that way justice more likely to be done.”  He explained that public
    access to the courts “allows anyone who cares to know the opportunity to see ‘that
    justice is administered in a non-arbitrary manner, according to the rule of law’”. 
    He characterized the “openness of our courts [as] a “principal component” of
    their legitimacy”.  He went on to recognize the principle’s “longstanding role
    as a common law rule required by the rule of law,” which is “clearly a broad
    principle of general application to all judicial proceedings.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lebel J., in his reasons dissenting in part, stated simply, at para. 81:
    “The hearing rooms where the parties present their arguments to the court must
    be open to the public, which must have access to pleadings, evidence and court
    decisions.”  He too emphasized the purpose of the open court principle in
    fostering public scrutiny of the way the courts function by noting at para. 83,
    “Thus, it has been argued that all participants in judicial proceedings will be
    further induced to conduct themselves properly if they know that they are under
    the watchful eye of the public”.  Further, at para. 85 he echoed Bastarache
    J.’s position that it is “essential that what the courts do be open to public
    scrutiny in order both to improve the operation of the courts and to maintain
    public confidence in them.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Bastarache J. and Lebel J. stressed the relationship between the
    open court principle and s. 2(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter<a name="SR;3131"></a> of Rights and Freedoms</i>, Part I of the <i>Constitution Act</i>, 1982, being
    Schedule B to the <i>Canada Act</i> 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the “Charter”). 
    Lebel J. more fulsomely explained at para. 88 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The open court principle, which was accepted long
    before the adoption of the Charter, is now enshrined in it. This is due to the
    fact that the principle is associated with the right to freedom of expression
    guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter. It is clear that members of the public
    must have access to the courts in order to freely express their views on the
    operation of the courts and on the matters argued before them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, in my view the phrase “open to the public” when interpreted
    to foster its enormously important purposes must be taken to mean a forum where
    the public understands it is free to enter without specifically requesting
    admission.  Here, while the Agreed Statement of Fact provides limited detail,
    it does state that “counsel were asked by court staff to join [the motion
    judge] in the anteroom adjacent to the courtroom” and that at the end of the
    proceedings, “counsel were instructed to return to the courtroom, where they
    and Mr. Palkowski awaited a copy of the endorsement”.  The Agreed Statement of
    Fact does not indicate who else, if anyone, was in the courtroom, when counsel
    were asked to enter the anteroom.  While the time when Mr. Palkowski arrived in
    the courtroom and whether he inquired about admission to the anteroom is not
    set out, it is clear he went to the courthouse for the motion and that upon his
    arrival he did not enter the anteroom to watch his case being adjudicated.  As
    a general matter, a judge’s chambers and anterooms are spaces which individuals
    other than court staff do not enter on their own but are ushered on those
    occasions when they are admitted.  The fact that counsel were ushered into the
    anteroom rather than entering on their own establishes to my satisfaction the
    anteroom was not open to the public.  Mr. Palkowski, no matter when he arrived,
    was not ushered into the anteroom.  It seems that the right of any member of the
    public or press to wander in and observe the day’s proceedings was not
    contemplated.  The respondent did not argue that the hearing in this case was
    open to the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The narrow interpretation of “open to the public” adopted by the
    majority will fall short of achieving s. 135’s statutory purposes of cultivating
    public confidence in the courts and fostering public oversight of the work of
    judges.  This case is an apt example.  Here, the motion judge proceeded in a
    most unconventional way.  The public should be able to easily scrutinize the novel
    procedures courts adopt in an effort to make the system more efficient.  If
    these novel procedures are implemented in rooms where the public does not have
    free access, the public’s ability to exercise oversight of the work of judges
    will be frustrated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that the procedure can be saved because counsel did not
    object when summoned into the anteroom by the motion judge.  First, I would
    distinguish <i>Leader Media Productions Ltd. v. Sentinel Hill Alliance Atlantis
    Equicap Ltd. Partnership </i>(2008), 237 O.A.C. 81 as it did not involve a
    statutory requirement.  More importantly, the open court principle exists for
    the benefit of the public as well as the litigants.  As explained above, it is
    associated with the rights guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter, including the
    freedom of the press.  Counsel’s action or inaction could not affect those
    rights.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I am concerned that a narrow interpretation of the phrase “open
    to the public” will have a far reaching effect beyond the court system itself. 
    It will affect the proceedings of a great many administrative tribunals,
    municipal and other public institutions, whose governing statutes require that
    proceedings be “open to the public”.  Section 9 of the <i>Statutory Powers
    Procedure Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. S.22 provides that, subject to specific and
    narrow exceptions, “an oral hearing shall be open to the public”.  Section 55(3)
    of the <i>Municipal Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. M-45 provides that “except as
    provided in [Section 55], all meetings shall be open to the public.”<a
name="SR;234"></a><a name="SR;237"></a>  The governing statutes of a great many
    administrative tribunals, municipal and other public institutions with
    decision-making bodies have similar provisions<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a>. 
    A narrow interpretation of this phrase risks allowing a great many public
    institutions to withdraw behind closed doors which, while not locked, are
    opened only upon the making of an express request for admission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons I would conclude that s. 135 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act </i>and rule 37.11 of the <i>Rules</i> both required the motion
    judge to deal with this motion in public.  However, given that I would allow
    the appeal on other grounds, I do not express any view as to the effect of her
    failure to do so on the force of the order as between the litigants.  </p>
  <h3>2.         The motion judge’s failure to give the
    appellants an opportunity to be heard is a denial of due process and a failure
    of natural justice</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants claim that the procedure adopted by the motion judge
    created a reasonable apprehension of bias.  That is not the way I would
    characterize the issue.  As I see it, the appellants’ concern may more appropriately
    be described as one of due process — that the motion judge adopted a procedure that
    did not accord with the basic requirements of fairness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Agreed Statement of Fact indicates, the motion judge prepared her
    endorsement before asking counsel to join her in the anteroom adjacent to the
    courtroom to receive her disposition.  Her endorsement was already on the back
    cover of the motion record when counsel were ushered into the anteroom.  She
    advised counsel “she had prepared an endorsement” and “then read her
    endorsement to counsel” without calling upon them to make submissions.  The
    motion judge did entertain the objections that appellants’ counsel made on his
    own initiative about the “wording of the endorsement”.  In response to these
    submissions, the motion judge then made revisions to her notes on the proposed
    amended claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The efforts of hard working judges to achieve greater efficiencies in
    the system should be supported.  However, basic standards must be observed.  Here,
    the motion judge did not merely indicate her preliminary views to counsel so
    that they could best focus their submissions.  She announced her decision
    before giving counsel a chance to speak.  I do not regard the submissions
    counsel made after the motion judge read her decision as a full and adequate
    opportunity to address the merits of the motion.  It is not unusual for counsel
    to make submissions about the wording of the decision after it is rendered, and
    as I read the Statement of Agreed Facts, that is all that occurred in this
    case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be
    done.  If the public or press had been ushered into the anteroom along with
    counsel, my view is that they would not have regarded the process as a fair
    one. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude that the appellants were denied due process.  They were
    not afforded a fair opportunity to attempt to persuade the motion judge that
    their reliance on the CLPA fell within the scope of the alleged upgrade they
    had been permitted to include in their amended claim.  They did make such
    submissions on appeal, which are discussed below.</p>
  <h3>3.         The appellants should have been
    permitted to include a statutory claim under the CLPA in the Amended Statement
    of Claim</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The heart of the appellants’ action, as originally framed, was the
    Agreement Claim, which alleged that the respondent had verbally agreed to hold
    the property in trust for them and to transfer it back to them upon request.  The
    motion judge struck the Agreement Claim and ruled also that the facts pleaded
    in relation to it should be deleted in the Amended Statement of Claim.  She allowed
    the appellants to include in their Amended Statement of Claim a particularized
    claim “for compensation or a constructive trust on the basis that the respondent
    was unjustly enriched as a result of the upgrades” the appellants claimed to
    have made to the property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 37(1) of the CLPA provides for a claim where “a person makes
    lasting improvements on land under the belief that it is the person’s own.”  I
    see no meaningful distinction between “lasting improvements” and “upgrades”.  The
    appellants’ claim under s. 37(1) is based on the appellants’ alleged upgrades
    to the property and thus falls within the scope of the “upgrades claim” that the
    motion judge permitted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 37(1) requires that the appellants made the lasting improvements
    believing the land was their own.  To advance the s. 37(1) claim, they had to
    plead facts setting out the basis for their belief that the property belonged
    to them.  They assert that they believed the property was theirs because of the
    alleged oral agreement with the respondent to re-convey the property to them
    upon request.  From the appellants’ point of view, while the oral agreement
    could not create legal rights, it is the basis of their subjective mistaken
    belief that the land was theirs.  Asserting the statutory claim under s.&nbsp;37(1)
    of the CLPA requires the appellants to plead many of the same facts they
    originally set out in support of their Agreement Claim, albeit from a somewhat
    different perspective.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s ruling of February 6, 2007 could not and, as I read
    it, does not, prevent the appellants from pleading the facts that are relevant
    to the permitted claim just because those facts had been relevant to the
    Agreement Claim and had already been pleaded to support it.  Facts pleaded
    because they were relevant to the alleged upgrades claim would not be facts
    that “related” to the Agreement Claim, even if they were the same facts.  The
    appellants therefore submit that their claim under s. 37(1) of the CLPA and the
    facts pleaded to support it should not have been struck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues that it is critical to remember that the motion
    judge dismissed the appellants’ claim summarily and the only claim she allowed
    to proceed was an unjust enrichment claim based on the alleged upgrades.  In my
    view, little is to be gained from debating whether a claim for compensation for
    lasting improvements made to land, which invokes a statute, falls with the
    permitted claim for “compensation or a constructive trust on the basis that the
    defendant was unjustly enriched as a result of the upgrades to the property”.  Even
    if further leave to amend were required, the respondent did not allege that any
    prejudice would result from permitting the inclusion of the statutory claim
    that could not be compensated for by costs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge therefore erred in striking the appellants’ claim under
    s. 37(1) of the CLPA from the Amended Statement of Claim. </p>
  <h3>4.         The motion judge improperly
    “redrafted” the appellants’ Statement of Claim </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Amended Statement of Claim that was before the motion judge on
    October 14, 2008, did not consist of a concise statement of the material facts
    to support either a claim under s. 37(1) of the CLPA or a claim for unjust
    enrichment.  The Amended Statement of Claim contained what was largely a
    re-articulation of the appellants’ allegation that the transfer of title to the
    property was understood by both parties to be temporary.  The motion judge
    properly struck the pleading of such facts as failing to comply with her
    supplementary endorsement of February 6, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As both her endorsement of October 14, 2008, and the Agreed Statement of
    Fact indicate, the motion judge was frustrated with both the delay in the proceedings
    and the failure of the appellants’ Amended Statement of Claim to accord with the
    directions given in her previous order.  Moreover, as I have already noted, the
    appellants had earlier flagrantly disregarded the motion judge’s directions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is understandable, then, that the motion judge wished to avoid
    further delay and took it upon herself to provide the appellants with the
    detailed wording that would be acceptable.  She attached to her endorsement the
    Amended Statement of Claim marked by her “to indicate what would need to be
    done for the amended statement of claim to comply”.  The appellants do not
    exaggerate in submitting that the motion judge, in effect, redrafted a major
    portion of their Statement of Claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that, in controlling the process before the court, a
    judge may give such directions as considered necessary for the matter to
    proceed in an orderly manner without undue delay.  That said, a judge should
    exercise caution before adopting a role inimical to the judicial function in the
    adversarial process.  Here, there is merit to the appellants’ submission that
    the motion judge interfered with their ability to fashion the pleading of their
    claim as they saw fit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the motion judge failed to include in her redraft of the Statement
    of Claim a properly pleaded claim under s. 37(1) of the CLPA.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the motion judge’s handwritten amendments require the appellants
    to plead that they paid “rent” to the respondent.  The appellants’ position
    however, is that as a matter of fact, they did not pay “rent”, but rather paid the
    mortgage payments, utilities and all other related property expenses.  A
    pleading stating that they paid “rent” may be reasonably viewed as undermining
    their pleading that they had a subjective belief that the land was theirs.  The
    pleading that they paid the “mortgage” simply alleges they paid money to the
    mortgage company and not to the respondent.  I do not view the appellants’
    pleading that they made payments to a mortgage company rather than to the
    respondent as an attempt to revive the properly struck Agreement Claim.  Whether
    payments were made, to whom they were made, and whether they support either a
    claim under s. 37(1) of the CLPA or a claim for unjust enrichment are questions
    for trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s endorsement and order make clear that the appellants
    could not regard her handwritten edits as merely suggestions of wording that
    they could consider.  To the contrary, the appellants were required to file an Amended
    Statement of Claim in the form of the edited version the motion judge attached
    as an appendix to her endorsement.  In my view, the motion judge improperly
    entered the litigation arena in this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would find that the motion judge erred by failing to hear the motion
    in public as required by s. 135(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> and rule
    37.11(2).  I would allow the appeal because the motion judge erred by depriving
    the appellants of due process by not affording them an adequate opportunity to
    make submissions, and erred by striking their claim under s. 37(1) of the CLPA as
    it was properly pleaded.  I would set aside the order of the motion judge dated
    October 14, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants filed with this court a redraft of their Amended
    Statement of Claim and asked for an order allowing them to file it.  I would decline
    to make such an order.  I would remit the motion to the Superior Court to be
    heard and determined by a different judge.  At that motion, the appellants can
    seek the court’s leave to file the revised Amended Statement of Claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As agreed by counsel, I would fix the appellants’ costs in the amount of
    $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MacFarland J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Juriansz
    J.A., and I must respectfully disagree with his disposition of some of the
    issues raised on this appeal and, in particular, four of the six grounds of
    appeal raised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the reality that much of the court’s business is conducted by
    judges in their personal chambers, as well as in retiring rooms and anterooms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were it not for the willingness of judges to do their work in places
    other than formal courtroom settings, there could be even greater delays in
    cases working their way through the system than there are presently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the motion judge was, at the time, assigned to the
    commercial list at Toronto.  This case is not a commercial list case. 
    Nonetheless, the motion judge agreed to accommodate counsel and hear their case,
    in addition to her regular list of cases.  She heard counsel in the anteroom
    adjacent to her courtroom and, in my view, absent any objection by counsel, it
    was perfectly appropriate for her to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the history of the proceeding, one can readily understand why the
    motion judge was “appalled” at the delay in the case and the apparent failure
    by the appellants to follow her direction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the agreed statement of fact filed in this court does the
    appellant say that they objected to the motion proceeding in chambers, as
    opposed to the courtroom.  Indeed, it is agreed that they did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the motion judge appeared to have already drafted an endorsement
    in part, and had ready suggested revisions to the statement of claim, it is
    clear from the agreed statement of fact that she listened to counsel’s
    objections to her proposals and made changes accordingly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We must not forget that this was not the first time this judge had been
    called upon to consider this pleading.  In a lengthy endorsement released
    August 16, 2006, this motion judge struck certain parts of the statement of
    claim for disclosing no cause of action.  Following a further attendance before
    her on November 23, 2006, she issued a further supplemental endorsement
    granting the plaintiffs leave to amend to provide particulars of their claim
    for unjust enrichment arising out of alleged upgrades they made to the
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appealed that order to this court.  Their appeal was
    dismissed May 22, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 28 of the supplemental endorsement released February 6, 2007,
    the motion judge provided the necessary detail in relation to the appellants’
    claim that had survived the motion to strike.  Following this court’s dismissal
    of their appeal in May, 2008, the appellants further amended the statement of
    claim, as the February ruling had permitted them to do.  The respondents were
    of the view that the pleading did not comply with the motion judge’s ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel agreed to appear before the motion judge to determine whether
    the proposed amended claim complied with her August 2006, and February 2007,
    orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That attendance proceeded on October 14, 2008, and it is from that
    attendance that this appeal arises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there is nothing in this record that in any way offends s.
    135(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43, which
    provides: “[s]ubject to subsection 2 and the rules of court, all court hearings
    shall be open to the public.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is also nothing in the record which suggests anyone was excluded
    from the judge’s chambers.  No one requested that the appellants personally be
    permitted to attend on the motion judge with their counsel.  In short, as the
    agreed statement of fact provides: “[n]either counsel objected at the time to
    dealing with the motion in this way.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, counsel had an obligation to object when before the motion
    judge.  It is inappropriate to raise this procedural objection now for the
    first time on appeal. If they wanted their motion heard in the courtroom, as
    opposed to chambers, they had the obligation to tell the judge so at the time: see <i>Leader Media Productions Ltd. v. Sentinel Hill Alliance Atlantis Equicap
    Ltd. Partnership </i>(2008), 237 O.A.C. 81 at paras. 50 and 56.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rules now provide for the hearing of motions via telephone and video
    conference.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> 
    As well, the rules provide that some motions may be heard by attendance, in
    writing, or by fax.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> 
    Indeed a motion for leave to appeal to this court is in the normal course made entirely
    in writing.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Many of these methods for hearing would not involve the
    attendance of the parties or their counsel, and the motions would, in all
    likelihood, be dealt with by judges somewhere other than in a formal courtroom
    setting.  Simply because a matter is dealt <span style='line-height:200%'>with
    in a judge’s chambers does not mean the hearing was not open to the public.  Moreover,
    in my view, courtrooms, and by courtrooms I mean anywhere where judicial
    business is conducted, are presumed to be open to the public.&nbsp; It is for
    this reason that whenever a party wishes to have specific persons, or indeed
    the public, excluded from a courtroom, an application must be made to the
    presiding judge or an order to that effect.<b> </b> </span>Absent some evidence
    of exclusion, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second, third, fourth, and fifth grounds of appeal are interrelated
    and, as such, I will deal with all four together.  The motion judge’s
    redrafting of the pleading, annexed as Schedule A to her order of October 14,
    2008, does not refer to the appellants’ claim made pursuant to s. 37(1) of the <i>Conveyancing
    and Law of Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. C-34 [<i>CLPA</i>].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps as a result of this claim not being raised by the appellants in
    the earlier drafts of their statement of claim, the motion judge appears to
    have misapprehended the submission the appellants sought to advance.  While their
    claims for a constructive trust by virtue of an oral agreement were struck
    earlier, and that ruling upheld by this court, the statutory claim they sought
    to advance is a different claim altogether.  Many of the facts they asserted to
    support the earlier constructive trust claim that was struck are relevant and
    will be relied upon to support their statutory claim.  In my view, the motion
    judge erred in striking the appellants’ statutory claim, and the material facts
    advanced in support of it, which included their characterization of the nature
    of the payments made by them over the years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last ground of appeal alleges that the motion judge exhibited a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.  The test for reasonable apprehension of bias on the part
    of a trial judge is a high one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test is: “[w]hat would an informed person, viewing the matter
    realistically and practically – having thought the matter through –
    conclude.”:  <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy
    Board)</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias calls into question not
    simply the personal integrity of the judge, but the integrity of the entire
    administration of justice.  Judges start with a presumption of impartiality.
    Where the ground is raised for the first time on appeal in circumstances where
    there is no record below, this court must exercise great caution:  see <i>e.g.
    R. v. Fell</i>, 2009 ONCA 551 at para. 9. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where counsel in the court below is of the view that the trial judge, or
    in this case, the motion judge, is exhibiting bias, they have the obligation to
    raise it with the judge below at the time.  At that point, a record will become
    available and the judge will make a ruling – both of which will then be
    available for this court to review.  That was not done here and the motion
    judge was not alerted to this issue, now raised for the first time on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simply because the motion judge did not find in favour of the appellants
    and struck a pleading which this court finds was in error, does not give rise
    to bias or any appearance thereof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal arises because of the appellant’s argument that:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.       there was no oral hearing in
    public; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.       the appellants were deprived
    of their right to make submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have already disposed of these grounds earlier in my reasons, concluding
    that the hearing was held in public, no one objected to the hearing being
    conducted in chambers, and no one who expressed desire to be present was
    excluded from the anteroom.  No objection was made to the proceeding being
    conducted as it was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the agreed statement of fact that counsel made submissions. 
    Further, the entered order, which would have required the approval of the
    appellants, provides in its preamble: “... and on hearing oral submission of
    counsel”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither of these arguments in the nature of natural justice are made
    out.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, I would allow the appeal on the sole ground that the
    motion judge erred in striking the appellants’ claim based on the <i>CLPA</i> and the material facts which support those claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs to the appellants in the agreed sum of $7,500, inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
