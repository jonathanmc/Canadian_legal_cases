  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contentious issues on this appeal are whether the trial judge erred
    in: i) awarding spousal support to the wife in the amount of $1,000 per month;
    ii) in ordering child support for the oldest child of the marriage retroactive
    to the date the husband stopped paying support for that child, and iii) in
    ordering payment of s. 7 expenses in the amount of $216 per month.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties separated in December 2004 following a 22 year marriage.
    They have two children now aged 19 and 21. At the time of trial, the husband
    was earning about $110,000 per year and the wife about $42,000 per year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early January 2005, the parties entered into a “self-made” separation
    agreement in which they agreed, among other things, that the husband would sign
    over to the wife his interest in the matrimonial home, and that, in exchange,
    the wife would not seek any interest in her husband's pension. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The separation agreement also provided for payment of child support of
    $1084 per month plus $216 per month on account of s. 7 expenses “until both
    children ... are of the age of 21, or still in school.” Further, the separation
    agreement stated, “[S]hall either child no longer attend school and obtain full
    time employment, I will cease to pay the support for that child.” The
    separation agreement was silent on the issue of spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed the husband's application for an order setting
    aside the parties' separation agreement and ordered the husband to pay child
    support in accordance with the separation agreement together with s. 7 expenses
    for post-secondary education on a proportionate basis. In addition, the trial
    judge ordered the husband to pay spousal support to the wife in the amount of
    $1000 per month. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to spousal support, on appeal, the husband contends that
    the trial judge erred in finding that the husband received “the lion's share of
    his equity” under the terms of the separation agreement. He claims that, in
    fact, the wife received substantially more under the separation agreement than
    she would have received on an equalization of net family properties and that
    the trial judge should have taken that into account in awarding spousal
    support. Further, the husband contends that the spousal support ordered was
    overly generous taking account of the child support being paid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this argument. Although the spousal support
    award may be generous when considered in the context of the property division
    made under the separation agreement, we do not consider that the amount ordered
    was outside the range of what would be appropriate, particularly taking account
    of the spousal support guidelines. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, we were advised today that the husband has declared bankruptcy.
    As a result, to the extent that the costs awarded below relate to property
    claims, the wife will be deprived of her costs. In addition, she will be
    required to assume responsibility for making the monthly payments on the
    parties’ line of credit, a responsibility the husband had assumed under the
    separation agreement. In these particular circumstances, we are not persuaded
    that we should interfere with the spousal support order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the child support order, the husband claims that there were
    no s. 7 expenses as of the trial date, or, for that matter, ever, and that the
    oldest child was no longer in school on the trial date. However, save with
    respect to the prospective order to share post secondary expenses, the support
    ordered was that provided for in the parties’ separation agreement. In the
    circumstances, we see no basis to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed. We are advised the trial judge's
    reasons concerning costs have just been released. The husband is at liberty to
    apply for leave to appeal that order if so advised to the extent his bankruptcy
    permits. </p>
