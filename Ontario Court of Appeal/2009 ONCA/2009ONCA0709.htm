style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two parties agreed on certain terms relating to the purchase and sale of
    farmland.  Did their discussions amount to an agreement or merely an “agreement
    to agree”?  If there was an agreement, were there sufficient acts of part
    performance to take the agreement outside the requirements of s. 4 of the <i>Statute
    of Frauds</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.19?  If so, was specific performance properly
    ordered?  This appeal depends on the answers to those questions.     </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie Sand and Gravel Limited (“Erie”) bought land from Seres’ Farms
    Limited (“Seres’ Farms”) that lay to the north of County Road 18 in the County
    of Essex (the “north side property”).  It wanted to buy other land that Seres’
    Farms owned on the south side of that road (the “south side property”).<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
    Erie wanted the south side property because it contained aggregate and Erie’s
    business depended on having an adequate supply of aggregate.  Seres’ Farms told
    Erie that it was willing to sell the south side property to it on the same
    terms as it had sold the north side property.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie knew that the south side property was subject to a right of first
    refusal in favour of Tri-B Acres Inc. (“Tri-B”).  It had a copy of the right of
    first refusal and recognized that giving Seres’ Farms an offer for the south
    side property could trigger its operation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie and Seres’ Farms met to discuss the purchase and sale of the south
    side property.  Erie told Seres’ Farms that because of the right of first
    refusal, it wanted to have all the terms agreed to before it gave Seres’ Farms
    a written offer.  Over the course of four meetings, the parties agreed that
    Erie would buy the south side property, consisting of 54.231 acres after
    allowing for the severance of a 180 ft. by 200 ft. piece of property on which
    the Seres’ family home stood, at a price of $22,000 per acre, with a closing
    date of April 11, 2003.  Seres’ Farms asked Erie to give it a written offer that
    reflected their agreement and said that Erie would get the south side property
    unless Tri-B matched its offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie prepared an offer in accordance with the agreed-on terms and
    delivered it to Seres’ Farms.  Seres’ Farms took the offer to Tri-B and Tri-B
    made an offer for the property that did not match the Erie offer.  Despite Seres’
    Farms promise to Erie, it accepted the Tri-B offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie immediately brought an action for specific performance of the
    agreement it had with Seres’ Farms and filed a certificate of pending
    litigation over the south side property.  Seres’ Farms called Tri-B about the
    lawsuit and Tri-B said it would take care of it for Seres’ Farms.  At Tri-B’s
    suggestion, the agreement between Seres’ Farms and it for the purchase and sale
    of the south side property was closed.  Tri-B was then added as a defendant in
    the action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated September 3, 2008 (the “Judgment”), among other
    things, Tri-B was ordered to transfer the south side property to Erie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B appeals.  Seres’ Farms took no part in the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie is a family corporation whose current principals are two brothers, Allan
    Koop (“Allan”) and Randy Koop (“Randy”).  Erie employs between 40 and 50
    people.  It is in the business of mining sand and stone aggregate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie mines in Essex County, an area scarce in aggregate supply.  It is
    estimated that the south side property holds 50% of the total quantity of
    aggregate available in Essex County, an amount that would satisfy Erie’s needs
    for between 5 and 10 years.  If Erie is unable to purchase the south side
    property, it will not be able to replace the aggregate with other aggregate. 
    Without aggregate, Erie will be out of business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Koop family has owned Erie since 1977.  The Koop family and the Seres
    family have been neighbours for over 30 years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early 1990’s, Seres’ Farms owned and farmed approximately 135
    acres of land in Essex County.  When their father died in 1988, Mike Seres
    (“Mike”) and Frank Seres (“Frank”) inherited Seres’ Farms.  They are the
    principals of Seres’ Farms.  At trial, Frank was found to have both actual and
    ostensible authority to bind Seres’ Farms in discussions with Erie about the
    purchase and sale of the south side property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peter Brunato is the principal and directing mind of Tri-B, a company
    involved in agricultural and greenhouse endeavours.  He, too, is a neighbour of
    the Seres family and has known them for many years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1996, Tri-B purchased approximately 50 acres of property from Seres’
    Farms.  At that time, Seres’ Farms gave Tri-B a right of first refusal over the
    south side property.  The right of first refusal states that on presentation of
    an offer by Seres’ Farms, if Tri-B wishes to exercise the right of first
    refusal, it must deliver to Seres’ Farms a signed offer to purchase on the same
    deposit, terms and conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The salient part of the right of first refusal reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the Vendor [Seres’ Farms] receives a <i>bona
    fide </i>arms length Offer to Purchase the said adjoining lands which the
    Vendor is willing to accept, the Vendor shall provide the Purchaser [Tri-B] with
    a copy of the Offer to Purchase, and the Purchaser shall have five (5) banking
    days following receipt to purchase the property by delivering to the Vendor a
    signed Offer to Purchase with the same deposit, terms and conditions, which the
    Vendor shall accept immediately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At various times since 1994, Erie has discussed with Seres’ Farms the
    possibility of buying its lands.  These discussions led to a written agreement
    in April 2002 for the purchase of the north side property, under the terms of
    which Erie purchased approximately 25 acres of land from Seres’ Farms.  The
    agreed price for the north side property was $22,000.00 per acre, with a
    severance for the house and surrounding one acre that was retained by Mike. 
    Following Erie’s purchase of the north side property, the south side property was
    Seres’ Farms sole remaining landholding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once an agreement had been reached for the purchase and sale of the
    north side property, Frank - on behalf of Seres’ Farms – told Erie that he would
    be willing to sell the south side property on the same terms as the north side
    property.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the sale of the north side property was concluded, Erie began discussions with Seres’ Farms about the purchase of the south side property. 
    Erie had a copy of the right of first refusal in favour of Tri-B.  It knew that
    a written offer would trigger Tri-B’s  right of first refusal and that was Erie’s
    main concern.  Because of this concern, Erie wanted to come to a verbal agreement
    with Seres’ Farms on all terms of the purchase and sale of the south side
    property before it gave Seres’ Farms a written offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2002 and January 2003, Erie and Seres’ Farms had four
    meetings to discuss Erie’s possible purchase of the south side property.  The
    trial judge recited, in detail, the significant evidence given about those
    meetings, including who was in attendance and what was discussed.  There is no need
    to repeat that evidence except to note three things.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in the meetings, Erie made it clear that because of the Tri-B right
    of first refusal, it would not give Seres’ Farms a written offer until all
    terms of the purchase and sale had been agreed to.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Seres’ Farms made it clear – during the meetings - that it needed
    a written offer, prepared by Erie, to present to Tri-B and that Tri-B would
    have to match the offer to get the south side property.  The written offer was
    a formality so that Seres’ Farms would have something to take to Tri-B.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, by the end of the final meeting on January 8, 2003, the parties
    agreed on a purchase price of $22,000.00 per square acre and a closing date of
    April 11, 2003.  They reviewed the amount of acreage to be purchased and agreed
    on 54.231 as the total acreage, after allowing for the severance of a 180 ft.
    by 200 ft. piece of property for the Seres’ family home.  They further agreed
    that (1) unless Tri-B matched the agreement, the south side property would be
    sold to Erie, and (2) all other conditions to be included in the offer to purchase
    the south side property would be the same as in the agreement for the purchase
    and sale of the north side property.  Following the final meeting on January 8,
    2003, Allan and Frank shook hands and agreed that they had a deal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frank acknowledged the agreement with Erie both in the final meeting on
    January 8, 2003, and in testimony at trial.  He understood that Erie and Seres’
    Farms had a deal unless Tri-B matched the terms that had been agreed on.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 9, 2003, Erie delivered a written offer to Seres’ Farms’
    lawyer (the “Offer”), along with a certified cheque for the entire purchase
    price of $1,193,082.00.  The Offer provides, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Vendor [Seres’ Farms] shall, on the day of acceptance
    of this Offer, deliver a copy of this Offer to Tri-B Acres and this Offer is
    conditional upon Tri-B Acres failing to exercise its right of first refusal
    within five banking days of receipt of a copy of this Offer.  If Tri-B Acres
    purchases the property by delivering to the Vendor a signed Offer to Purchase
    with the same deposit, terms and conditions which the Vendor has accepted then
    this Offer shall become null and void and the purchaser’s deposit shall be returned
    to the purchaser [Erie] without penalty, interest or deduction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Offer reflected the terms that Erie and Seres’ Farms had agreed to
    over the course of their four meetings:  Seres’ Farms would sell the south side
    property to Erie at a price of $22,000.00 per acre for 54.231 acres, subject to
    the severance of a 180 ft. by 200 ft. residential lot, with a closing date of
    April 11, 2003, subject to Tri-B exercising its right of first refusal.  It
    also provided that if the Offer was not accepted by 4:59 p.m. on January 10,
    2003, the Offer would become null and void and the deposit returned.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seres’ Farms then delivered a copy of the Offer to Tri-B (Brunato). 
    When Frank delivered a copy of the Offer to Brunato, he told him the Offer was
    acceptable and that he had to match the Offer or he would sell the property to
    Erie.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 10, 2003, Tri-B prepared an offer to purchase the south side
    property (the “Tri-B Offer”).  The Tri-B Offer is the same as the Offer in all
    respects except that the deposit was $25,000.00 – as opposed to $1,193,082.00 –
    and the closing date was May 1, instead of April 11.  The Tri-B Offer was later
    amended to provide for a further payment of $75,000, in addition to the $25,000
    deposit, with the balance to be secured by a mortgage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the fact that the Tri-B Offer did not match the Offer, on
    January 10, 2003, Seres’ Farms accepted it.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie immediately started the present action and filed a certificate of pending
    litigation against the south side property.  Frank called Brunato about the
    lawsuit and Brunato offered to take care of the lawsuit for him.  Brunato told
    Frank that he would pay Seres’ Farms’ legal fees, file a defence on its behalf,
    and use a single lawyer to defend the action on behalf of both Seres’ Farms and
    Tri-B.  At Brunato’s suggestion, the agreement between Seres’ Farms and Tri-B for
    Tri-B’s purchase of the south side property was closed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL DECISION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that as of January 8, 2003, Erie and Seres’ Farms had
    agreed on price, acreage and terms - including the closing date - for the
    purchase and sale of the south side property.  He also found that the parties
    agreed that Erie would get the property unless Tri-B matched the Offer.  He noted
    that Frank Seres acknowledged the agreed terms and confirmed his understanding that
    the only way that Erie would lose the south side property was if Tri-B matched
    or bettered the Offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge observed that the doctrine of part performance has been
    held to exclude the operation of s. 4 of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>.  After stating
    that this doctrine requires that the acts “must unequivocally refer to and
    support the alleged agreement and be amenable to no other interpretation”, he
    found that the following were such unequivocal acts of part performance:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie
    prepared the Offer on January 8 and delivered it to Seres’ Farms on January 9;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Offer
    reflected the material terms, the parties, the property and price;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie
    delivered a certified cheque for the full purchase price, together with the
    Offer;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie
    knew and expected that delivery of the Offer would trigger the Tri-B right of
    first refusal;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frank
    Seres delivered the Offer to Tri-B; and,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    Tri-B Offer is a virtual mirror image of the Offer, subject only to the differences
    in the amount of the deposit and closing date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found, based on the testimony of Allan Koop and Frank
    Seres, that the parties had reached an agreement on the terms contained in the
    Offer.  He further found that the Offer was a “sufficient note or memorandum” and
    a statement of the essential terms of the contract, sufficient to satisfy s. 4
    of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found that Tri-B did not match the Offer as
    required by the right of first refusal.  Accordingly, he found that by accepting
    the Tri-B Offer, Seres’ Farms breached the agreement it had with Erie.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then referred to Erie’s testimony that the south side
    property was unique to its needs for, at least, the following reasons:  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie’s
    financial existence depends on an adequate supply of aggregate;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>aggregate
    is in scarce supply in Essex County;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>50%
    of the remaining aggregate in Essex County, not under Erie’s control, is
    located on the south side property.  No other lands in the County of Essex
    containing aggregate are for sale; and, </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    aggregate on the south side property represents a 5 to 10 year supply for
    Erie’s needs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded, at para. 36 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This evidence was not contradicted or challenged by
    the defendants.  I find that the subject property is unique to Erie’s needs and
    that Erie shall, for that reason, be entitled to specific performance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held, alternatively, that if he were incorrect in holding
    that Erie was entitled to specific performance, he would have found Erie
    entitled to damages from Tri-B for inducing Seres’ Farms to breach its agreement
    with Erie.  He recited the legal elements necessary to prove a claim for
    inducing breach of contract, also referred to as the tort of conspiracy, and
    for interference with contractual relations.  He held that the necessary
    elements had been proven based on the following findings:  Brunato had a copy
    of the Offer; Frank told Brunato that the Offer was acceptable to Seres’ Farms and
    that Tri-B would have to match the Offer if it wished to purchase the property pursuant
    to the right of first refusal; Tri-B was unwilling or unable to match the Offer
    but prepared its own offer and encouraged Seres’ Farms to accept it; and Tri-B
    provided Seres’ Farms with an indemnity agreement in respect of the present
    lawsuit and arranged to defend it on its own behalf and for Seres’ Farms.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B argues that the trial judge erred in finding:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> that
    Erie and Seres’ Farms reached an oral agreement for the purchase and sale of
    the south side property; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    were sufficient acts of part performance to take that agreement outside of s. 4

  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B
    could not purchase the south side property unless it was on the same terms and
    conditions as those in the Offer;  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B
    induced Seres’ Farms to breach its agreement with Erie; and, </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erie
    was entitled to specific performance of the agreement with Seres’ Farms.</p>
  <h4>WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN ERIE AND SERES’ FARMS?<span lang=EN-US>  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B accepts that by January 8, 2003, Erie and Seres’ Farms had come to
    an agreement on certain terms respecting the purchase and sale of the south
    side property.  It argues, however, that the agreement was no more than an
    “agreement to agree”.  It contends that the discussions between the parties
    were merely negotiations and that the intention was that Erie would draft a
    written offer reflecting the agreed terms and present it to Seres’ Farms for
    acceptance.  Thus, it says, an executed written document was necessary in order
    for a binding agreement to exist between Erie and Seres’ Farms.  Further, it
    argues that the terms of the Offer, which provide for Seres’ Farms acceptance,
    demonstrate that acceptance of a written offer was required for legal
    obligations to arise between the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the findings of the trial judge, this ground of appeal
    cannot succeed.            </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B made the same argument below.  In rejecting it, the trial judge
    stated, at para. 24 of his reasons:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that as of January 8, 2003, the parties
    agreed on price, acreage and terms, including the closing date.  Frank Seres
    acknowledged as much and confirmed his understanding that the only way Erie
    would not get the property required Tri-B to either match or better the Erie
    offer under the terms of the Tri-B right of first refusal.  In fact, he
    acknowledged that he made that very point with Brunato when he met with him on
    January 10, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In finding that an agreement had been reached, the trial judge relied on <i>Bawitko Investments Ltd. v. Kernels Popcorn Ltd. </i>(1991), 79 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    97 (Ont. C.A.).  In <i>Bawitko</i>, this court held that where parties have
    agreed on all the essential provisions<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> to be incorporated into a formal document and they intend the agreement to be
    binding, a valid and binding agreement exists – the existence of the agreement
    does not depend on the formal written document.  The fact that a formal written
    document is to be prepared and signed does not alter the binding validity of
    the original contract.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same issue was recently considered by this court in <i>UBS Securities
    Canada Inc. v. Sands Brothers Canada Ltd</i>. (2009), 95 O.R. (3d) 93.  In <i>UBS
    Securities</i>, the parties had discussions about the purchase and sale of
    100,000 shares of the Bourse de Montréal Inc.  The trial judge found that a
    binding oral agreement for the sale of shares was made in a telephone call in
    which the essential terms of the agreement - number of shares, price per share
    and settlement date - were settled.  She held that an objective, reasonable
    bystander would conclude, in all the circumstances, that the parties had
    intended to contract.  In finding that a binding agreement was reached in the
    oral discussions between the parties, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    contention that the discussions were only negotiations and that a written share
    purchase agreement was necessary for the formation of a contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this court upheld the trial decision.  It held that the trial
    judge made a finding of fact when she determined that the parties did not
    intend a written agreement to be a condition of the bargain.  Consequently,
    such a determination is not to be reversed absent palpable and overriding
    error:  see <i>UBS Securities </i>at paras. 60 and 71.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In the present case, it cannot be said that the trial judge made a
    palpable and overriding error in finding that as of January 8, 2003, Erie and
    Seres’ Farms had come to an agreement.  There was no suggestion by either Erie
    or Seres’ Farms that they intended that a written document was necessary in
    order for a binding agreement to come into existence.  To the contrary.  The
    witnesses for both Erie and Seres’ Farms testified that an agreement had been
    reached for the sale of the south side property by January 8, 2003, and that Erie
    would lose the property only if, on presentation of the Offer, Tri-B exercised
    the right of first refusal.  Indeed, Seres’ Farms’ statement of defence admits
    the Agreement.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, not only did both Erie and Seres’ Farms testify that they
    understood an agreement had been reached by January 8, 2003, both acted on the
    basis of that agreement.  As Erie promised, it prepared the Offer in accordance
    with the agreed terms and delivered it to Seres’ Farms.  As Seres’ Farms
    promised, it took the Offer to Tri-B and made it clear that the property would
    be sold to Erie unless Tri-B matched the Offer.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I wish to conclude on this issue by reiterating the terms of the agreement,
    as found by the trial judge.  The agreement was not simply that Seres’ Farms
    would sell the south side property, consisting of 54.231 acres, to Erie at a
    price of $22,000 per acre and a closing date of April 11, 2003.  The agreement
    was that Erie would present Seres’ Farms with a written offer containing those
    terms and that Seres’ Farms would sell the south side property to Erie on those
    terms, unless Tri-B validly exercised its right of first refusal.<a

    When I refer to the “Agreement” hereafter, I am referring to this broader set
    of obligations that Erie and Seres’ Farms undertook.  As will become evident
    below, it is important to keep in mind the full terms of the Agreement between
    Erie and Seres’ Farms.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WERE THERE SUFFICIENT ACTS OF
    PART PERFORMANCE TO TAKE THE AGREEMENT OUTSIDE S. 4 OF THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be enforceable, s. 4 of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i> requires that an
    agreement for the sale of lands (or some note or memorandum thereof) be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged.  Section 4 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name=S4></a><i>No action shall be brought</i> to
    charge any executor or administrator upon any special promise to answer damages
    out of the executor’s or administrator’s own estate, or to charge any person

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of s. 4 of the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>is to prevent
    fraudulent dealings in land based on perjured evidence.  However, Equity will
    not allow the <i>Statute of Frauds</i> to be used as an “engine of fraud”.  It
    created the doctrine of part performance to prevent the <i>Statute of Frauds</i> from being used as a variant of the unconscionable dealing which it was
    designed to remedy: see <i>Hill v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General)</i>, [1997] 1
    S.C.R. 69, at para. 10.  The requirements in s. 4 of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i> must give way in the face of part performance because the acts of part
    performance fulfill the very purpose of the written document – that is, they
    diminish the opportunity for fraudulent dealings with land based on perjured
    evidence.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    However, the second requirement in s. 4 – that the “party to be charged” sign
    the written document – was not fulfilled because Seres’ Farms never signed the
    Offer.  Accordingly, the trial judge considered whether the doctrine of part
    performance operated to exclude the operation of s. 4. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B submits that the trial judge erred in three ways in concluding
    that there were sufficient acts of part performance to exclude the operation of
    s. 4.  First, it contends that Erie has not suffered a detriment such that it
    would be unconscionable to allow Tri-B to set up s. 4 of the <i>Statute of
    Frauds</i>.  Second, it says that only acts of the plaintiff (Erie) can be
    considered when determining whether there are sufficient acts of part
    performance.  Consequently, it submits that the trial judge erred by considering
    acts of Seres’ Farms, in addition to those of Erie.  Third, it argues that the
    acts in question are not “unequivocally referable to dealings in land” and,
    therefore, cannot amount to sufficient acts of part performance.  </p>

    bisected a farm belonging to Ross Hill.  The issue for the courts was whether,
    at the time of expropriation, the province granted Mr. Hill an equitable
    interest in the expropriated land which permitted him to move people, cattle

    acted on that promise - “[t]he Department of Transport by its actions in

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the terms of an agreement have already been
    carried out, the danger of fraud is averted or at least greatly reduced.  To
    borrow a phrase from the law of tort, the thing speaks for itself.  In the
    present case, for example, it does not matter so much what was said.  What is
    critical is what was done; and what was done was the construction and
    maintenance of access ramps.  There is no mistaking the purpose for which those
    ramps were constructed: it was to allow Mr. Hill a way of reaching and crossing
    the highway.  Accordingly, in this instance strict adherence to the literal
    terms of the writing requirement would not serve the purpose for which it was
    devised.  Fraud would not be prevented; rather, the appellants [the Hill

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In para. 10 of <i>Hill</i>, Cory J. explains why Equity created the doctrine
    of part performance.  He does so by quoting the following from <i>Steadman v.
    Steadman</i>, [1976] A.C. 536 at p. 558 (H.L.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[This doctrine] was evoked when, almost from the
    moment of passing of the Statute of Frauds, it was appreciated that it was
    being used for a variant of unconscionable dealing, which the statute itself
    was designed to remedy.  A party to an oral contract for the disposition of an
    interest in land could, despite performance of the reciprocal terms by the
    other party, by virtue of the statute disclaim liability for his own
    performance on the ground that the contract had not been in writing.  Common
    Law was helpless.  But Equity, with its purpose of vindicating good faith and
    with its remedies of injunction and specific performance, could deal with the
    situation.  … Where, therefore, a party to a contract unenforceable under the
    Statute of Frauds stood by while the other party acted to his detriment in
    performance of his own contractual obligations, the first party would be
    precluded by the Court of Chancery from claiming exoneration, on the ground
    that the contract was unenforceable, from performance of his reciprocal
    obligations; and the court would, if required, decree specific performance of
    the contract.  Equity would not, as it was put, allow the Statute of Fraud “to
    be used as an engine of fraud.”  This became known as the doctrine of part
    performance – the “part” performance being that of the party who had, to the
    knowledge of the other party, acted to his detriment in carrying out
    irremediably his own obligations (or some significant part of them) under the
    otherwise unenforceable contract. [Citations omitted.]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding that the doctrine of part performance operated to prevent
    the province from relying on the writing requirement, Cory J. stated at para.
    16:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Steadman</i>, <i>supra</i>, makes clear, the very purpose of the doctrine of part performance
    is to avoid the inequitable operation of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>.  … The
    writing requirement is specifically required to give way in the face of part
    performance or estoppel by conduct, because the part performance or conduct
    fulfils the very purpose of a written document. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With these principles in mind, I turn now to consider Tri-B’s arguments
    on the sufficiency of the acts of part performance.  </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>            Is it unconscionable to allow Tri-B to take
    the benefit of s. 4?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B’s first argument is that Erie has suffered no detriment that would
    render it unconscionable for it (Tri-B) to set up s. 4 of the <i>Statute of
    Frauds</i> and retain the ensuing benefit, namely, receipt of the south side
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, <i>Hill </i>is a full answer to this argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hill </i>stands for this principle: if one party to an otherwise
    unenforceable agreement stands by while the other party acts to its detriment
    by performance of its contractual obligations, the first party will be
    precluded from relying on the requirements in the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>to
    excuse its own performance.  As I will explain, application of this principle
    leads to the conclusion that Seres’ Farms is precluded from relying on s. 4 of
    the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>to excuse it from performance of its obligations
    under the Agreement.  Further, in the circumstances of this case, Tri-B cannot
    stand in a better position than Seres’ Farms.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall the terms of the Agreement:  Erie agreed to provide Seres’ Farms
    with a written offer for the purchase and sale of the south side property on
    the agreed terms.  Seres’ Farms agreed it would present the Offer to Tri-B and,
    unless Tri-B matched it, Seres’ Farms would sell the south side property to
    Erie on the agreed terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened?  Erie carried out its obligations under the Agreement –
    it prepared and delivered to Seres’ Farms a written offer that reflected the
    agreed terms.  Seres’ Farms did nothing to prevent this – that is, it “stood
    by” as Erie performed its part of the Agreement.  Seres’ Farms took the benefit
    of Erie’s performance because it got what it wanted, namely, a written offer
    for the purchase of the south side property which it could put to Tri-B,
    pursuant to the right of first refusal.  Seres’ Farms also took the ultimate benefit
    of the Agreement because Erie’s performance is what enabled Seres’ Farms to sell
    the south side property at a price of $22,000 per acre.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, Seres’ Farms only partly fulfilled its obligations under the Agreement. 
    As promised, it took the Offer to Tri-B.  However, it did not sell the property
    to Erie when Tri-B failed to match the Offer, a matter on which more is said
    below.  Despite that, and in breach of its obligations under the Agreement, Seres’
    Farms sold the south side property to Tri-B rather than to Erie.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject the suggestion that Erie suffered no detriment because it got
    its deposit back.  That suggestion ignores reality: Erie’s real detriment is loss
    of the south side property, which it desperately wants because it contains the aggregate
    Erie needs to carry on its business.  Erie acted to its detriment in performing
    its obligations under the Agreement because had it not delivered the Offer,
    Seres’ Farms would have been unable to use the right of first refusal to
    provoke an offer from Tri-B.  As Erie performed its obligations under the
    Agreement to its detriment while Seres’ Farms stood by, Equity will not permit
    Seres’ Farms to rely on the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>to excuse it from
    performing its obligations under the Agreement.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances - where Tri-B was fully aware that Seres’ Farms
    would sell the property to Erie if Tri-B did not match the Offer, and Tri-B did
    not match the Offer - Tri-B cannot stand in a better position than Seres’
    Farms.  To permit Tri-B to set up s. 4 to defeat the Agreement would have the
    effect of excusing Seres’ Farms from performance of its obligations under the
    Agreement and, as I have explained, Equity will not permit that.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, Equity will intervene because it would be unconscionable
    for the <i>Statute of Frauds</i> to be used when Erie acted to its detriment by
    irremediably carrying out its obligations under the otherwise unenforceable
    contract.  Equity devised the doctrine of part performance to remedy precisely
    this kind of situation – it will not stand by and allow the <i>Statute of
    Frauds </i>to be used as “an engine of fraud”.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Is the
    doctrine of part performance limited to a consideration of acts of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B says that to constitute part performance, the acts relied on must

    judge erred because he considered the acts of Seres’ Farms, as well as those of
    Erie, in finding that there were sufficient acts of part performance to take
    the agreement outside of s. 4 of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, <i>Hill </i>is a complete answer to this argument.  In <i>Hill</i>,
    the plaintiffs<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[13]</span></span></span></a> were Mr. Hill’s sons, the successors in title to his farmland.  The respondent
    – that is, “the party to be charged”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[14]</span></span></span></a> – was the province.  In finding that the requirements of the doctrine of part
    performance had been met, the Supreme Court relied primarily on the acts of the
    province in constructing and maintaining the access ramps, rather than on acts
    of the plaintiffs.  In fact, the only act of the plaintiffs that is referred to
    is Mr. Hill’s reliance on the province’s promise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, Seres’ Farms is “the party to be charged”.  As
    such, it stands in the same position as that of the province in <i>Hill</i>. 
    Given that the Supreme Court considered the province’s acts when determining
    whether the doctrine of part performance had been satisfied, it cannot have
    been an error on the part of the trial judge to have considered the acts of
    Seres’ Farms in addition to those of Erie, the plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Mount Sinai Hospital Centre v. Quebec (Minister of Health and Social
    Services)</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 281, provides additional support for rejecting
    the Proposition.  At para. 13 of <i>Mount Sinai Hospital</i>, Binnie J., in
    concurring reasons, states:<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Our Court [in Hill] concluded that there had
    been “part performance”</i> <i><u>by the</u></i><u> <i>province</i></u><i>,</i> and “[q]uite simply equity recognizes as done that which ought to have been

    [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, it appears to me that given the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Hill</i>, it is now settled law in Canada that the acts of both parties to an
    alleged oral agreement may be considered when a court is called on to determine
    if sufficient acts of part performance take an alleged agreement outside the
    operation of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>.  I am fortified in this conclusion
    by two considerations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in <i>Levine v. Davies </i>(1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 252, this court took
    an approach similar to that in <i>Hill – </i>it did not limit itself to a consideration
    of the acts of the plaintiff alone when determining whether there were acts of
    part performance that took the matter outside the operation of s. 4 of the <i>Statute
    of Frauds</i>.  The relevant facts in </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>Levine</i> are these.  Levine entered into a lease
    with Davies as tenant and Canadian Educational Alternatives Ltd. (“CEA”) as
    guarantor.  Under the terms of the lease, Davies had the right to assign it to
    a non-profit corporation authorized to operate a private school.  West Island
    Schools of Ontario Inc. (“West Island”), a non-profit corporation authorized to
    operate a private school, took possession of the leased property and operated a
    school.  However, the lease was never formally assigned.  Levine sued Davies
    and CEA for rent for the unexpired term of the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first instance, Davies and CEA were held liable because the lease had
    not been validly assigned.  On appeal, the trial decision was reversed in
    part.  This court held that the trial judge had erred in failing to consider
    whether there were acts of part performance that could support an equitable
    assignment of the lease and take it outside the operation of the <i>Statute of
    Frauds</i>.  The following conduct was found to be sufficient part performance: 
    West Island took possession of the property; Davies never paid rent personally;
    Levine accepted rent cheques from West Island; and, Levine sent correspondence
    concerning the property not to Davies but to West Island.<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[16]</span></span></span></a> 
    Accordingly, Davies was released from his obligations under the lease although CEA,
    as guarantor, remained liable.  Because it was Davies who relied on the alleged
    oral agreement, if the Proposition were law, the court would have been precluded
    from considering the acts of anyone but him.  However, as </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>we have seen, this court did not take such a restrictive
    view.  Instead, it considered the acts of West Island and Levine in addition to
    those of Davies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in my view, there is nothing in the rationale for the doctrine of
    part performance that would limit the court to a consideration of the acts of
    the plaintiff alone. As <i>Hill </i>makes clear, the doctrine exists to prevent
    a person from relying on the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>to excuse performance of
    an agreement when that person stood by while the other party to the agreement
    performed, to his or her detriment.  It is self-evident that the party
    maintaining that it performed to its detriment (while the other stood by) has
    the burden to prove that it so acted.  That is, in order to bring itself within
    the doctrine, the party attempting to rely on an alleged oral agreement must prove
    its acts of performance of the alleged agreement and it must also prove that
    the other party “stood by”.  It is the performance by one party, coupled with
    the standing by of the other party, which would make it inequitable for the
    other party to rely on the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>to be relieved of its
    obligation to perform.  However, while the rationale for the doctrine requires
    proof of detriment, it does not limit the party to proving detriment solely by
    reference to its own acts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, in my view, the Proposition flows from the conflation of two
    distinct, albeit related, aspects of the doctrine of part performance.  The
    first aspect is detrimental reliance which, as has been noted, requires a party
    to prove its acts of performance.  Without detrimental reliance there can be no
    inequity in relying on the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>, thus, it is the first
    hurdle to be met.  The second aspect of the doctrine, however, relates to Equity’s
    requirement that the acts of part performance sufficiently indicate the
    existence of the alleged contract such that the party alleging the agreement is
    permitted to adduce evidence of the oral agreement.  This latter requirement is
    discussed in the following section.  For the purpose of this discussion, it is
    significant to note that these two aspects of the doctrine are not synonymous. 
    The former is a matter of substantive law based on the rationale for the
    doctrine of part performance, whereas the latter is primarily evidentiary in
    nature.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span

      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A brief comment about the cases that recite the Proposition as a
    statement of law is in order.  I begin with <i>Cotterhill and Cotterhill v.
    Parkway Development Corp. Ltd. </i>(1981), 29 A.R. 222 (Q.B.) at p. 226, aff’d
    (1982), 39 A.R. 398 (C.A.), the decision on which Tri-B relies for its
    submission that the Proposition is good law.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[18]</span></span></span></a>  <i>Cotterhilll </i>falls within the group of cases that pre-date <i>Hill</i>.  For
    the reasons already given, those cases have been overtaken by <i>Hill</i> and are
    no longer good law.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of the Ontario cases that have been decided post-<i>Hill</i>, some offer
    no authority for the Proposition,<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[19]</span></span></span></a> others refer to English texts or English caselaw, and yet others rely on decisions

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[20]</span></span></span></a> 
    Accordingly, it will be apparent that none of the cases are binding on this
    court.  In any event as I have explained, I cannot reconcile the Proposition
    with <i>Hill</i>.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Are the acts of
    part performance unequivocally referable to dealings in land?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on <i>Deglman v. Brunet Estate</i>, [1954] S.C.R. 725, Tri-B submits
    that the acts of part performance, as found by the trial judge, are
    insufficient to take the matter outside the operation of s. 4 of the <i>Statute
    of Frauds </i>because they do not “unequivocally refer to dealings with [the]
    land under the provisions of a pre-existing oral agreement”.<a href="#_ftn21"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[21]</span></span></span></a> 
    Specifically, Tri-B says that: the Offer cannot be viewed as unequivocal
    evidence of a pre-existing contract because it contemplated written acceptance
    by Seres’ Farms; payment of money is inherently equivocal and, consequently,
    Erie’s delivery of the cheque with the Offer is of little or no consequence; and,
    delivery of the Offer by Seres’ Farms to Tri-B is insufficient because it was not
    an act of the plaintiff, a matter discussed above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Close examination of <em>Deglman</em> is the starting point for addressing this submission.  The facts of <em>Deglman</em> are these.  Both George Constantineau and his aunt lived in Ottawa.  When he was about 20 years of age, he attended a technical school and, for approximately six months of the school year, lived with his aunt, Laura Constantineau Brunet, at No. 550 Besserer Street.  Ms. Brunet owned both No. 550 and the adjoining property, No. 548.  While Mr. Constantineau lived with his aunt, he did chores on both properties.  He claimed that during this period, his aunt promised to leave him No. 548 in her will if he would do the things she asked of him from time to time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the school term ended, Mr. Constantineau returned to his mother’s
    home.  He never again lived at No. 550 and at no time did he live at No. 548.  He
    did continue to help his aunt, however, by taking her on trips to Montreal and
    elsewhere, doing odd jobs at the two houses and running her personal errands.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Brunet died intestate.  Mr. Constantineau brought an action against the estate in which he sought title to No. 548 based on the alleged oral agreement.  The trial judge ordered that the oral agreement be enforced.  That judgment was affirmed on appeal.  On further appeal, however, the Supreme Court of Canada set aside the judgment and, instead, awarded him damages on a <i>quantum
    meruit </i>basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two judgments were rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Deglman</i>. 
    Rand J., writing on behalf of himself, Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J., would
    have allowed the appeal because he viewed Mr. Constantineau’s acts as “wholly
    neutral” in that they were not connected to either property.  He observed that
    there must be a connection between the acts of performance and a dealing with
    the land, stating that the acts must be “referable only to the contract alleged”<a
href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[22]</span></span></span></a> (the “Rand test”).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cartwright J. delivered the majority judgment.<a href="#_ftn23"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[23]</span></span></span></a> 
    Like Rand J., he found that none of Mr. Constantineau’s acts had a connection to
    No. 548 Besserer Street or to any dealing with that land.  However, he took a
    different view of what connection had to exist between the acts of part
    performance and the alleged oral agreement.  Where Rand J. would have required the
    conduct to be referable only to the specific contract that had been alleged,
    Cartwright J. held that it was sufficient if the acts were “unequivocally referable
    in their own nature to some dealing with the land” (the “<i>Deglman </i>test”). 
    In reaching this view, he relied on the following quotation from Duff J. in <i>McNeil
    v. Corbett</i> (1907), 39 Can. S.C.R. 608, at pp. 611-612:<i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] plaintiff who relies upon acts of part
    performance to excuse the non-production of a note or memorandum under the
    Statute of Frauds, should first prove the acts relied upon; it is only after
    such acts <i>unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with
    the land</i> <i>which is alleged to have been the subject of the agreement sued
    upon </i>have been proved that evidence of the oral agreement becomes
    admissible for the purpose of explaining those acts.  [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the question becomes: are the acts of part performance as found by
    the trial judge “unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing
    with the [south side property]”?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In answering this question, the first step is to determine whether the
    acts of part performance are connected to the land.  In this regard, the
    conduct in the present case stands in marked contrast to that in <i>Deglman</i>. 
    In <i>Deglman, </i>it will be recalled, the acts of performance consisted of
    Mr. Constantineau doing chores on two properties, driving his aunt about and doing
    her personal errands – those acts are not referable to any particular piece of
    property.  In this case, however, each act of part performance relates directly
    to the south side property.  The Offer recites that it is for the south side
    property; the deposit, on which more is said later, is tied to the Offer; and
    the reason that Seres’ Farms took the Offer to Tri-B is the right of first
    refusal over the south side property.    Thus, it is undeniable that each of
    the acts of part performance relates to the south side property.  Put another
    way, the conduct is unequivocally referable in its own nature to the south side
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it is not sufficient that the conduct is unequivocally
    referable to the property in question; the conduct must also, in and of itself,
    indicate that there had been “some dealing with the land”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span

    aspect of the requirement.  <i>Haskett v. O’Neil</i>, [1939] 4 D.L.R. 598 (Ont.
    C.A.) pre-dates <i>Deglman</i> but, nonetheless, provides some assistance in
    this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Haskett</i>, as in the present case, the question was whether acts
    of part performance took an oral agreement outside the operation of the <i>Statute
    of Frauds</i>.  Because the case predated <i>Deglman</i>, this court followed
    English law and applied the Rand test.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[25]</span></span></span></a> 
    It will be recalled that the Rand test is significantly more stringent than the <i>Deglman </i>test<i> </i>because the Rand test would require the acts to be
    referable only to the alleged contract and no other, whereas the <i>Deglman </i>test
    requires only that the acts be referable to “some dealing with the land”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In applying the more stringent Rand test in <i>Haskett</i>, Robertson
    C.J.O., on behalf of the court, stated at p. 601:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To determine whether or not the acts relied upon in
    any particular case are within this description, one must have regard to all
    relevant circumstances in order to determine their true character.    </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not necessary for respondent [plaintiff] to
    show acts of part performance that could not by any stretch of the imagination
    be referred to some other title than a contract such as that alleged.  I think
    one must have regard to the way in which reasonable people carry on their
    affairs and if the acts relied on are of such a character that, judged by the
    standards in accordance with which reasonable people commonly act, they would
    not be done except in part performance of a contract such as is alleged, that
    is sufficient part performance to avoid the operation of the statute.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is much to be said for the commonsensical approach taken in <i>Haskett</i>. 
    Based on that but modified to reflect the less stringent <i>Deglman </i>test,
    in my view, the proper approach to making such a determination is this.  Begin
    by determining the context (or the “relevant circumstances” to use <i>Haskett </i>terminology). 
    Then consider the acts of part performance having regard to the way in which
    reasonable people carry on their affairs.  Indeed, although not stated
    explicitly, based on a full reading of the trial judge’s reasons, he followed
    such an approach.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What, then, were the relevant circumstances within which the trial judge
    viewed the acts of part performance?  Erie established that it had a copy of
    the right of first refusal and knew that delivery of an offer to Seres’ Farms could
    trigger its operation.  It had also established that the south side property was
    critical to its financial viability because it contained a large store of
    aggregate, there were no other available properties in Essex County with
    aggregate, and its financial existence depended on an adequate supply of
    aggregate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is within this context that the trial judge considered the acts of
    part performance to determine whether to admit evidence of the oral agreement. 
    I will not recite those acts again but they begin with Erie delivering the
    Offer to Seres’ Farms along with a “deposit” in the form of a certified cheque
    for $1,193,082.00, the full purchase price for the south side property.  The
    Offer specifically provided that on the date of acceptance of the Offer, a copy
    would be delivered to Tri-B.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[26]</span></span></span></a> 
    This provision mirrors but is not identical to the provision in the right of
    first refusal which required Seres’ Farms to deliver a copy of an offer to
    Tri-B only if the offer was acceptable to it.  By taking the Offer to Tri-B,
    Seres’ Farms demonstrated that it had accepted the Offer.  Seres’ Farms indicated
    precisely that, stating that unless Tri-B matched the Offer “it was gone to
    Koop [Erie]”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that delivery of an offer to purchase land, with a deposit, will
    not normally amount to part performance.  It happens every day and is not
    suggestive of a pre-existing agreement in respect of the land.  In fact, it
    suggests the opposite – namely, that the offeror is hoping to be able to enter
    into an agreement to purchase the property.  But that is not this case.  In
    this case, to the knowledge of all, there was a right of first refusal over the
    property.  The right of first refusal is critical because it dictated that acts
    be performed in a particular sequence.  Further, the Offer was not in standard
    form and the “deposit” was not a deposit in the ordinary sense of the word as
    it was for the full purchase price.  In these circumstances, judged by the
    standards on which reasonable people act, was the trial judge entitled to
    conclude that the conduct reflected that there had been “some dealing” in the
    land?  In my view, it was open to the trial judge to find that the acts were
    referable to “some dealing with the land”, such that evidence of the oral
    agreement was admissible for the purpose of explaining those acts.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the doctrine of part performance is to avoid the
    inequitable operation of s. 4 of the <i>Statute of Frauds</i>.  As I have
    explained, Erie acted to its detriment in reliance on the Agreement.  It also proved
    acts of part performance sufficiently referable to some dealing with the land
    such that it would make it inequitable for the defendants to rely on s. 4 of
    the <i>Statute of Frauds </i>to avoid performance.  That is especially true in
    this case where Seres’ Farms openly and repeatedly acknowledges the Agreement
    and it is Tri-B that seeks to invoke the <i>Statute of Frauds</i> to render the
    Agreement unenforceable.  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>COULD TRI-B PURCHASE THE LANDS
    ON TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE OFFER?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B argues that even if the trial judge was correct in concluding
    there were sufficient acts of part performance to give rise to an enforceable
    contract, that contract remained subject to its right of first refusal to
    purchase the south side property.  It says that it exercised the right of first
    refusal by entering into an agreement with Seres’ Farms.  It contends that if
    Seres’ Farms thought the Tri-B Offer was better than the Offer, Seres’ Farms was
    entitled to accept the Tri-B Offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see
    nothing in this argument.  The right of first refusal is clear: if Seres’ Farms
    received a <i>bona fide</i> offer that it was willing to accept, it had to
    present the offer to Tri-B.  Tri-B then had five days within which to purchase
    the property by delivering to Seres’ Farms a signed offer to purchase “with the
    same deposit, terms and conditions”.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[27]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seres’
    Farms was prepared to accept Erie’s <i>bona fide</i> offer and duly presented
    the Offer to Tri-B.  However, as the trial judge found, Tri-B did not match the
    Offer.  Tri-B delivered a deposit of only $25,000 with its offer, whereas Erie
    gave the full purchase price of approximately $1.1 million on delivery of the
    Offer.  Further, Tri-B’s closing date was later than that in the Offer. 
    Therefore, Tri-B did not give Seres’ Farms an offer “with the same deposit,
    terms and conditions”, as the right of first refusal required.  Because there
    was no valid exercise of the right of first refusal, given the terms of the Agreement
    between Seres’ Farms and Erie, Seres’ Farms was not entitled to accept the
    Tri-B Offer.      </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DID TRI-B INDUCE SERES’ FARMS TO BREACH THE AGREEMENT?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light
    of my conclusions on the other issues, it is unnecessary to deal with this
    ground of appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DID THE TRIAL JUDGE ERR IN ORDERING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tri-B
    submits that as a result of breach of the Agreement, Erie will suffer only one
    type of harm, namely, loss of future profits.  It argues that because loss of
    future profits is compensable in damages and specific performance can be
    awarded only where damages are inadequate, it was not open to the trial judge
    to order specific performance.  As support for this argument, Tri-B points to
    the fact that the trial judge made no finding that damages were inadequate. 
    Thus, it says, the order for specific performance must be set aside.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    reject this submission for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, given
    the findings of the trial judge, the premise on which this submission is based
    (<i>i.e. </i>that the only harm Erie will suffer, if the Agreement is breached,
    is loss of future profits) cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be
    recalled that the trial judge accepted the uncontradicted, uncontested evidence
    led by Erie that: its financial existence depends on it having an adequate
    supply of aggregate; aggregate is in scarce supply in Essex County; 50% of the
    remaining aggregate in Essex County not under Erie’s control is located on the
    subject property; no other lands in the County of Essex containing aggregate
    are for sale; and, the aggregate on the south side property will supply Erie
    with sufficient aggregate to meet its needs for a period of between 5 and 10
    years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On these
    findings, the clear inference is that Erie needs to purchase the south side
    property so that it will have sufficient aggregate to continue in business. 
    There is no evidence on the record to suggest otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Koop
    family has owned and run Erie since 1977.  In my view, it is self-evident that
    loss of a family business represents far more than merely the loss of whatever
    profits would have been made had it been able to continue in business.  For
    that reason, I reject the foundation on which this ground of appeal rests, namely,
    that Erie’s only harm, should it not be awarded the south side property, is the
    loss of future profits.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, and
    in any event, although the trial judge did not utter the words “damages are
    inadequate”, he made the determinations necessary to justify the order for
    specific performance.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree
    that specific performance is not to be ordered for breach of contract unless
    damages are inadequate.  However, recent decisions show that the concepts of
    inadequacy of damages, uniqueness of the subject matter of the agreement, and
    the requirement of a “fair, real and substantial claim” to specific performance
    are interrelated and all bear on whether a plaintiff has met the requirements
    for specific performance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    damages are found to be inadequate, it is generally because of the unique
    nature of the property bargained for.  It is on that basis that the remedy has
    historically been granted in cases involving the sale of real property – real
    property being presumed unique: see <i><span lang=EN-US>1110049 Ontario Ltd. v.

    deciding the case.  Further, while the Alberta Court of Appeal affirmed the
    trial decision in <i>Cotterhill</i>, it did so on the basis that no agreement
    had been reached between the parties.  In light of that and as the appeal
    decision makes no reference to the Proposition, I do not view the appeal decision
    in <i>Cotterhill </i>as having affirmed the Proposition.  </p>
