  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s finding that the respondent’s consulting contract was
    repudiated without cause by the appellant is amply supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that while there were staff complaints about the
    respondent’s lack of communication and support, there were never any warnings
    nor opportunities for improvement given at any time before the meetings of June
    29 and 30.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 30, Mr. McKinnon was highly critical of Mr. Eady in front of
    staff. He was told his job responsibilities had changed and he was to focus
    only on ASG sales.  In such circumstances the trial judge’s finding that his
    responsibilities at Brainhunter were taken away implicitly is the only
    reasonable conclusion on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law in holding that
    it terminated the respondent’s consulting contract by way of anticipatory
    breach.  Treklogic does not take issue with the trial judge’s formulation of
    the test for anticipatory breach: namely whether Mr. Eady was deprived of
    substantially the whole of the benefit of the contract.  What Treklogic submits
    is that the trial judge failed to consider:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the change in Mr. Eady’s responsibilities was a <i>bona fide </i>response
    to serious issues with Mr. Eady’s employment; and </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>these changes could not, in any case, be a breach of the agreement
    because Mr. Eady’s responsibilities at that time were not contemplated by the
    consulting agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The change in the consulting agreement involving a transfer from the
    Treklogic side to the Brainhunter side of the company was done on consent of
    both parties.  It is not now open to Treklogic to say that the further transfer
    back to ASG in a lesser capacity was merely a return to what was contemplated
    by the consulting agreement.  More importantly, Treklogic did more than realign
    Mr. Eady’s responsibilities when it told him to focus on ASG sales; pursuant to
    the consulting agreement he was to be the president of ASG.  Mr. Eady protested
    on June 30 that Treklogic had breached their agreement and his lawyer wrote to
    Mr. McKim of Treklogic on July 2 saying that he had repudiated the agreement
    and requesting written confirmation that the express terms of the consulting
    agreement would be observed.  Treklogic did not reply and say that there had
    been no repudiation.  Instead McKimm, the president of Treklogic replied by
    voicemail and said Eady would not be getting the letters requested and that “there
    is no reason for me to give you back responsibilities …”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The consulting agreement specifically contemplated termination for cause
    – these provisions were either inapplicable or not proved by the appellant.  In
    any event the trial judge concluded that even if Mr. Eady’s conduct could be
    considered to give rise to cause, the failure to give any warning or reasonable
    opportunity to improve his performance was fatal to the appellant’s claim and
    we agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view on the particular facts there was no duty to mitigate.  The
    consulting agreement was, as the trial judge found, part of a package deal
    whereby the respondent sold his shares in the company he had developed to the
    appellant in return for which he received a consulting agreement, shares and
    warrants in the appellant company.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of cross-appeal the respondent (appellant by cross-appeal) argues
    that because he was never given written notice of termination he was entitled
    to 24 months of payments, being for the balance of the term of his consulting
    contract in which he characterizes as a debt owed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any debt, if there was one, flowed from the contract which had been
    repudiated.  The language of the contract is clear and it specifically
    contemplates 12 months of payments each in the sum of $10,000 to be paid
    immediately or in 12 instalments in the event of termination without cause. 
    Any other interpretation would render that clause meaningless.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs to the respondent, of the appeal less the costs of the
    cross-appeal, fixed in the sum of $17,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
