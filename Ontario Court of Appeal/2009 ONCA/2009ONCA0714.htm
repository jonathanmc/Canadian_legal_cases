  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following his trial in the Superior Court of Justice before Gans J,
    without a jury, the appellant was convicted of four counts of sexual
    interference. Two other charges - invitation to sexual touching and sexual
    assault – were stayed in accordance with the rule against multiple convictions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for six months concurrent on
    two counts. On the other two counts, he received a conditional sentence of
    twelve months concurrent but consecutive to the six-month term of imprisonment.
    He appeals only against conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges date back to 2001 and 2002 and involve allegations that from
    December 2001 to and including April 2002, the appellant engaged in repeated
    acts of sexual touching – including oral sex and full intercourse – with the
    complainant who, to the knowledge of the appellant, was then 13 years old.
    Given the complainant’s age, consent was not an issue, even though, as the
    trial judge found, the complainant willingly participated in the alleged
    activity with the appellant who was then age 32. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue at trial was whether the alleged acts of sexual interference
    occurred. The complainant claimed that they did and the appellant denied them. The
    trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant and found that the
    evidence of the appellant did not raise a reasonable doubt. The appellant
    submits that in assessing credibility, the trial judge committed two errors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he submits that the trial judge misapplied this court’s decision
    in <i>R. v. G.(M.)</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 347, by reversing the burden to
    proof and placing an onus on the defence to demonstrate that inconsistencies in
    the evidence of a child witness must be “major” before their potential impact
    on credibility need be considered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground. While the trial judge may have used
    some imprecise language during oral argument, his reasons make it clear that in
    all matters, including credibility, he recognized that the onus remained on the
    Crown throughout and it never shifted. His reasons are likewise clear that in
    determining that the various inconsistencies relied upon by the defence did not
    “amount to major inconsistencies”, the trial judge was primarily referring to
    details as to “time and space” which, having regard to the complainant’s young
    age, he characterized as “minor” or “peripheral” – the kind of inconsistencies
    that are expected of a child witness and which in his view did not affect the
    complainant’s credibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, when the reasons are read fairly as a whole, we reject the
    appellant’s submission that the trial judge misinterpreted <i>R. v. G.(M.)</i> to
    mean that “minor” inconsistencies  can never be used, either alone or in
    conjunction with other evidence, to raise a reasonable doubt. As the following
    passage from his reasons indicates, the trial judge considered all of the
    inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence, both alone and in conjunction
    with the other evidence, in arriving at his decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the first place, I am not persuaded that the “time
    and space” constraints urged upon me by the defence give rise to a reasonable
    doubt alone or in combination with the other evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider
    significant inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and that of  Keith
    Cameron, a witness called by the defence.  In particular, the appellant maintains
    that it was essential for the trial judge to resolve a black and white conflict
    in their testimony wherein the complainant claimed that Cameron walked in on
    her and the appellant in the upstairs bedroom of Cameron’s house after she and
    the appellant had had sex, showered and got dressed and Cameron claimed that no
    such event ever occurred. In line with this, the appellant submits that the
    trial judge also failed to consider the significance of Cameron’s evidence that
    the appellant did not have a key to Cameron’s house and was never there alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject those submissions. The trial judge gave cogent reasons for
    rejecting the material aspects of Cameron’s testimony. In short, he found that
    Cameron’s evidence was inconsistent in material respects with the evidence of
    the appellant and his mother. Moreover, he rejected as unreliable Cameron’s
    evidence as to the number of times the appellant stayed at his home and the
    place where he slept when he was there. In this regard, the trial judge found
    that Cameron’s recollection on these matters “was in error and for good reason having
    regard to the passage of time (approximately five years) and the fact that Cameron
    was only recently contacted to testify for the defence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that Cameron was an unreliable historian on these
    matters, the fact that he denied seeing the appellant and the complainant in
    the upstairs bedroom fully clothed took on far less significance. In short, the
    inconsistency in question was not a matter of such pressing importance that it
    required resolution and as this court has stated on numerous occasions, it is
    not incumbent on trial judges to address, much less resolve, every inconsistency
    that may arise on evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises a third ground of appeal in which he submits that
    the conduct of the trial judge rendered the trial unfair. In particular, he contends
    that the trial judge made derogatory remarks about the conduct of defence
    counsel, undercut defence counsel’s questioning of the witnesses, and made some
    off-colour comments that “cumulatively undermined the appearance of fairness
    and created the appearance of bias”. In support of this submission, the
    appellant has set out in Appendix “A” of his factum over a dozen examples of
    the kind of conduct about which he complains. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We find it unnecessary to address the various complaints on an item by
    item basis. Suffice it to say that the trial judge exhibited impatience at
    times and some of his comments should not have been made and others were ill
    chosen and could have been phrased in a more courteous, less abrasive fashion. In
    addition, he should not have instructed defence counsel that he could not make
    further objections. However, as the record shows, the impugned instruction did
    not deter counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considered as a whole, however, we are not persuaded that the trial
    judge’s interference deprived the appellant of his right to a fair trial. The
    appellant concedes that there was no actual prejudice or unfairness.  We
    agree.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before leaving this subject, we consider it worth stating that while
    trial judges bear responsibility for ensuring that the trial proceeds in an
    orderly and efficient fashion and are entitled to be firm in carrying out this
    function, it is essential that, in doing so, they maintain judicial decorum. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
