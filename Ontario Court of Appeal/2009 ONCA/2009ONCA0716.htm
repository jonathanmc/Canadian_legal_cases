style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Proof of criminal responsibility for bruises and broken bones inflicted
    upon a one-month-old baby is often a difficult task.  Some components of the
    proof, like the nature of the injuries caused, are often uncontroversial, while
    others, like the identity of the person responsible, spark vigorous dispute and
    involve conflicting evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The controversy here settled on the identity of the victim’s assailant.
    The prosecutor claimed that it was the appellant, the baby’s father. The
    appellant denied responsibility and pointed to the victim’s mother, a
    prosecution witness, as the person responsible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the appellant caused the victim’s
    injuries, thus that he was guilty of the offence charged, aggravated assault. 
    The appellant says that the trial judge’s reasons are fatally flawed in several
    respects, requiring at least a new trial, if not a verdict of acquittal. The
    Crown contends that the conviction is uncontaminated by legal error, but that
    the sentence imposed, a conditional sentence of 18 months, constitutes an error
    in principle and should be replaced by a sentence of actual imprisonment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal from conviction,
    quash the conviction and order a new trial.  In the circumstances, I do not
    reach the Crown appeal from sentence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>            <b>An Overview</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The indictment, amended at the beginning of
    trial, alleged that the offence occurred between June 13, 2005, the date of the
    victim’s birth, and July 11, 2005, the date on which the victim was referred to
    a pediatric specialist for investigation of suspicious and unexplained bruising
    to her legs. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The prosecution’s case against the appellant included
    several components:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>            i.          expert evidence about the victim’s injuries,
    including the nature of the force used to cause them and the time period within
    which they were likely inflicted;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>            ii.         evidence of the
    appellant’s opportunity to cause the victim’s injuries;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>            iii.       evidence of alleged remarks made by the
    appellant to his common law spouse (the victim’s mother) and another witness
    (the mother’s step-sister) alleged to amount to admissions of responsibility
    for having caused the victim’s injuries; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>            iv.        evidence of a post-arrest police interview of
    the appellant recorded on video with accompanying audio on July 22, 2005, said
    to contain admissions of criminal responsibility.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The prosecution’s case was that on June 27 and
    July 11, 2005, days immediately following periods during which the appellant
    had the exclusive or near-exclusive opportunity to cause injury to the victim,
    others observed bruises on the child’s body in areas later associated with some
    but not all her fractures.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s response to the prosecution’s
    case was a denial of responsibility for the injuries suffered by the victim. 
    The appellant testified on his own behalf. His denial included a disavowal of
    any admissions of responsibility to his common law partner and her step-sister,
    and an explanation of what he said during his police interview.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Principals and Their
    Relationship</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and K.O. began living together in
    February, 2004, when K.O. was pregnant with her first child.  When the baby was
    born, K.O., who was then sixteen, was uncertain about the infant’s paternity. Subsequent
    DNA testing established that the father was not the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and K.O. shared child care
    responsibilities for K.O.’s first child.  The child’s biological father had
    regular access. The baby was healthy and the access arrangements created no
    difficulty. The appellant provided financial support for the household and its
    occupants from his job at a local meat processing plant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Later in 2004, K.O. discovered that she was
    pregnant again. The appellant and K.O. considered giving up the second child
    for adoption and had several discussions with adoption agencies and prospective
    adoptive parents to explore this prospect.  In the end, however, about one
    month before the victim was born on June 13, 2005, the appellant and K.O.
    decided to keep the new baby.  K.O. was seventeen years old when her second
    child was born.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>K.O. returned to work at a local restaurant
    about two weeks after the baby was born. She returned because she liked the
    work, not because she felt she needed a break from her childcare
    responsibilities, which now included two children, a newborn and another, 13
    months old. The couple followed the same child care routine with both children.
    The appellant was responsible for some feedings, as well as preparation of the
    evening meal and the baby’s formula.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>K.O. struck the appellant twice during the time
    they lived together, once hitting him with a baseball bat.  The appellant never
    hit K.O.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The First Bruises: June 26-28,
    2005</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Early in the evening of June 26, 2005, K.O. went
    out with her cousin, J.G., leaving the appellant to care for both children.
    K.O. couldn’t recall whether she fed and changed the victim at 6:00 p.m. or
    10:00 p.m. that day, although she was home in time for the later feeding. Nor
    could K.O. recall who did the next change and feeding at 2:00 a.m. on June 27,
    2005.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When changing and feeding the victim at 6:00 o’clock
    the following morning, K.O. noticed bruises on the baby’s shins and ankles. 
    She had no idea how or when the bruises were caused or first appeared.  When
    the appellant had checked on both children and K.O. as he left for work at
    about 4:30 or 5:00 a.m. on June 27, 2005, everyone was asleep.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>K.O. dropped the victim off at a friend’s house
    around 8:00 a.m. on June 27, 2005, but said nothing to her friend about any
    bruises on the baby’s legs. She was not concerned about the bruises at that
    time.  K.O.’s step-mother was to pick the baby up later in the morning and care
    for her until K.O. finished her shift at a local restaurant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When K.O. returned to her step-mother’s home to
    pick up the victim later in the afternoon, her step-mother mentioned that the
    baby had bruises on the front (shins) and back (calves) of both legs.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Check-up and Hospital Visit</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the victim’s regularly-scheduled medical
    appointment on June 28, 2005, K.O. did not tell the doctor anything about the
    bruising she had noticed on the baby’s legs a day earlier. The doctor checked
    the baby’s hips and weighed her with her clothes off, but noticed no bruises. 
    The baby was not fussy during the doctor’s examination.  The doctor did notice,
    however, that the infant had not gained any weight since birth.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>K.O. spoke to her step-mother after the doctor’s
    appointment for the baby.  Her step-mother, J.O., didn’t think that K.O. was
    being truthful with her when K.O. told her that the doctor didn’t see the
    bruises because she (the doctor) had weighed the baby while the infant was
    wearing her sleepers.  J.O. made it clear to K.O. that the baby should be taken
    to the emergency department of a nearby hospital to be examined. Initially,
    K.O. resisted her step-mother’s proposal, but later agreed to take the baby to
    the hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The physician who examined the baby in the
    emergency department on June 28, 2005, was not called as a witness.  The physician’s
    report, filed as an exhibit, notes: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>“? bruise –-could be from pressure
    against leg. *This will warrant watching” …“spots – ? bruising?”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The doctor noted no tenderness along the baby’s
    shins, an area on which there were bruises.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the examination, J.O. confronted K.O.
    about the bruises, suggesting that either K.O. or the appellant had caused
    them.  K.O. denied having caused the bruises.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Second Set of Bruises: July
    10-11, 2005</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 10, 2005, the appellant took the baby to
    a family gathering.  He returned home around 4:30 p.m.  K.O. left the apartment
    around 7:00 p.m. to go out drinking with a friend.  K.O. returned to the
    apartment by cab around 11:30 p.m.  She was so intoxicated that the appellant
    had to help her out of the cab and assist in putting her to bed.  K.O. said
    that she had drunk about half a large bottle of Jack Daniels.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant fed and changed the baby at 10:00
    p.m. on July 10, 2005, and again at 2:00 o’clock the following morning.  He
    followed his usual routine and accomplished his task without incident.  Before
    leaving for work at 5:00 a.m. on July 11, 2005, the appellant checked on K.O.
    and both children.  All were asleep.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When K.O. changed and fed the baby at 6:00 a.m.
    on July 11, 2005, she noticed six or seven fingerprint-sized bruises on the
    baby’s buttocks.  But the baby was not fussy.  K.O. called her step-mother,
    told her about the bruises, then left the baby with her father and step-mother
    on the way to work that morning.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>J.O. saw several bruises on the baby’s buttocks
    and couldn’t settle the baby down after K.O. left. J.O. took the baby to Dr.
    French who confirmed the bruises on the buttocks, as well as a couple of small
    bruises on the baby’s legs. The doctor also detected some blood abnormalities.
    Concerned that “something was going on”, Dr. French arranged a hospital
    appointment for the baby for the following day.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Hospital Examinations</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 12, 2005, Dr. Richard van Wylick, a
    pediatrician, examined the victim at Hôtel Dieu Hospital.  He observed bruises
    on the baby’s left thigh and buttock and a small bruise on her right buttock. 
    He considered the presence of bruising in a one-month-old infant as highly
    suspicious for a non-accidental injury.  Bruising, let alone extensive
    bruising, rarely appears on infants of such an age. Dr. van Wylick also
    expressed concern about the baby’s apparent failure to thrive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The nature of the victim’s injuries resulted in
    her hospitalization as healthcare professionals suspected child abuse and
    wanted to have a full body skeletal survey performed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Don Soboleski, a radiologist, examined the
    x-rays taken of the victim on July 19 and 20, 2005.  He found four fractures of
    posterior ribs on each side of the child’s body, as well as fractures of the
    major bones, the femur and tibia, of both legs.  The leg injuries were classic
    metaphyseal lesions, highly specific for non-accidental abuse.  All fractures
    displayed new bone formation, indicating that the healing process was under way
    in both the rib cage and the legs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. van Wylick gave evidence about the type of
    force required to cause the injuries he observed on the victim’s body.  The rib
    injuries required compression of the whole chest, together with levering of the
    baby’s spine.  The infant’s chest must have been free-floating when the rib
    fractures occurred, not held or pushed against a rigid surface.  The doctor
    expressed the view that the rib injuries were non-accidental in origin.  The
    mechanism used and the force required to cause the rib injuries were of such a
    nature that an ordinary person would recognize them as sufficient to cause
    injury to the baby.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In Dr. Soboleski’s view, a person would have to
    hold the baby and apply sufficient force to fracture the ribs.  The person
    applying the force would have to have a portion of his or her hand on the
    baby’s chest, the balance of the hand on the infant’s back.  It takes a
    significant squeeze or compression on the thorax to make it break over that

lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. van Wylick described the victim’s leg
    injuries as “classic metaphyseal lesions”, the result of torsion or shear
    stress applied through the distal metaphysis.  These injuries require traction,
    in other words, pulling, along the length of these long bones, potentially
    accompanied by twisting.  The force required to cause these injuries would be
    recognized by an ordinary person as likely to cause injury to the body, not the
    product of moving the child’s legs to facilitate diaper changes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Soboleski confirmed that the leg fractures
    required a twist or a torsion or a shear force.  These injuries did not occur
    as a result of any direct impact at or near the fracture site.  These injuries
    could <i>not</i> have been caused by changing the baby, although they could be
    the product of a severe shaking or swinging the infant while holding on to a
    limb.  Significant force was required to cause these textbook examples of
    non-accidental injuries.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Soboleski explained that dating injuries
    from the examination of X-rays is based on the appearance of the healing
    response around the fracture site.  The dating of the injuries by this method
    is not an exact science.  Usually, at four to six weeks after the injury, new
    bone is incorporated into the cortex.  No incorporation occurred here.  There
    was new bone formation, however, that led Dr. Soboleski to conclude that the
    injuries, which could have occurred at the same or different times, would be at
    least one week and closer to two weeks old at the date of X-ray, July 19-20,
    2005.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Soboleski acknowledged that the injuries

    July 20, 2005, she asked the appellant: “Why did you do it?”.  He either looked
    at her or denied responsibility.  K.O. pressed her demand and accused the
    appellant of lying to her.  The appellant responded: “I didn’t mean to do it”.
    By then, K.O.’s other child had been apprehended by child protection authorities. 
    K.O. told the appellant that he had to confess his responsibility for the
    injuries first to her and then to the police so that she (K.O.) could see her
    other daughter again.</span></p>

    after the victim was admitted to hospital, L.C. conducted her own investigation
    to determine who had caused the baby’s injuries.  In her quest for information,
    L.C. made it known that she wanted to speak to the appellant. Ultimately, L.C.
    spoke to the appellant on the telephone. </span></p>

    the baby’s injuries.  The appellant told L.C. that he had caused injuries to
    the baby, but “not to the extreme” of the injuries that the infant had
    suffered.  The appellant said that he might have squeezed the baby too hard
    when he was changing her diaper, but he didn’t know when the injuries occurred.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>(1)       </span>D/ CST. GOAD          Okay, so as I have advised to
    you, you realize why you have been arrested and charged with aggravated
    assault, and I have been upfront with you and have advised you that I
    understood from speaking to a couple of people that you had confessed to [K.]
    so what I did was I sought out [K.] and spoke to her in person and interviewed
    her last night under video and she advised me that she confronted you which she
    [<i>sic</i>] got home from the hospital and maybe you can just let me know your
    side of the story obviously you know, you’ve got something to say, and you
    would like to share it and it is  your right, okay so you can just go ahead and
    tell me</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            WADFORTH:            Oh
    like I said in the jail, I never intentionally would I hurt anybody, I never
    knew any of these like, damages, or anything till, he [sic] came home on
    Tuesday, I think she came home on Tuesday or Wednesday and she told me about
    them and I had no clue what had happened, so like I was, as soon as I found out
    I was shocked and I didn’<span lang=EN-US>t know what had happened so</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            D/CST.GOAD           Okay, and you say
    you didn’t        mean to hurt the baby</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            WADFORTH:           And no way would I
    ever, ever      hurt anybody, for any reason whatsoever        </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>(2)       </span>WADFORTH:            … and she came home around twelve
    o’clock or so that night and had had too much to drink that night, so I took
    care of her, put her to bed, and made sure she was okay, then I knew she wasn’t
    going to be able to get up in the morning and take care of the child cause she
    was too drunk or whatever, and then took her in you know, I brought out the baby,
    fed her, changed her and to the best of my recollection, I don’t remember doing
    anything</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            D/CST.GOAD            You
    don’t remember doing anything</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> WADFORTH:           No
    it could have been because of like all the stress that I have been under lately
    or what not but to my recollection, I don’t remember doing anything</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (3) 
        WADFORTH:            Well for like the bruises as far like, bruises, as far
    as I know, I was just like holding her trying to burp her and I don’t know if I
    was squeezing her too tight, or what I was doing, but then the next day, like
    the day after, I was told, there were bruises, I didn’t know where they came
    from.  And then as for the other ones I was just changing her, like holding her
    legs like up to her stomach, just to make sure nothing you know, she didn’t put
    her foot in the diaper or anything, and then I don’t know if I, just my, you
    know, stressed out too much and I put down more pressure than necessary or what
    had happened</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> D/CST. GOAD          I
    see so you’re were [<i>sic</i>] explaining that you pulled her legs and her
    knees up and you think you may have put too much pressure on her knees or
    something you twisted</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> WADFORTH:           I
    crossed  her legs and was like just  holding her down, like not for, as far as
    I know I wasn’t putting force behind it, I was just holding her             there
    and it could have been stress from everything, you know, just got to me too
    much and I could have been not even knowingly doing damage and I didn’t know
    what happened<span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>(4)       </span>D/CST. GOAD           Really, okay and getting back
    to you know, [K.] and these injuries, so I mean you obviously admitting that you
    caused these injuries but maybe doing in just the stress load you’re under. Is
    that correct</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            WADFORTH:           Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            D/CST. GOAD          Yes?</p>

    maybe were under some stress during those times as well? Where you may have
    caused some injuries at all</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            WADFORTH:           No       </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            D/CST. GOAD          Not
    that you can recall</span></p>

    that Monday, you believe was the 11<sup>th</sup> of July</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            WADFORTH:           As
    far as I know</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>            </span>D/CST. GOAD          Were [sic] things got to you
    and you probably were a little too forceful with the baby </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            WADFORTH:           Too
    much of it was building just to too fast, I didn’t have, you know, didn’t vent
    it somewheres, probably</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            D/CST.
    GOAD          Yeah, so you took it out on the four week old baby</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            WADFORTH:           Well
    to the best of my recollection, I don’t like, I don’t remember doing this</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Appellant’s Evidence</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, who is without prior convictions,
    testified on his own behalf.  He denied having caused the injuries suffered by
    the victim.  Further, he disclaimed any acknowledgement of responsibility to
    K.O. and any conversation with, much less admission to, K.O.’s step-sister,
    L.C.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant only saw bruises on the victim
    when he picked her up after work on July 11, 2005, at the home of K.O.’s father
    and step-mother.  He explained the procedure he always followed for diapering
    and feeding the baby, the same procedure he had followed for K.O.’s other child,
    who had never had any health problems.  He had never been angry with the baby,
    or gripped the infant in any unusual way.  He abjured the use of any excessive
    or unusual force and denied ever having treated the baby in the way illustrated
    by the medical witnesses to demonstrate the likely mechanism of injury.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified that he answered the
    investigator’s questions honestly, although he was extremely upset by the
    unexpected arrest and the nature of the accusations made against him.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s several grounds of appeal
    overlap.  Each focuses on the reasons of the trial judge and alleges a flaw
    that, on its own or together with others, is said to require at the least a new
    trial, if not a verdict of acquittal.  The grounds of appeal, as I would
    paraphrase them for discussion purposes, are these:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>                        i.          failure to properly apply the
    analysis required by <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>,          [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>                        ii.         failure
    to provide any or adequate reasons for the essential findings                                                 of
    fact and, in particular, for rejection of the appellant’s evidence;                                       and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>                        iii.       misapprehension
    of material parts of the evidence resulting in a                                            misapplication
    of the burden or dilution of the standard of proof                                          required
    in a criminal prosecution.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span lang=EN-US>The First Ground: The W.
    (D.) Error</span></i></h3>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The
    Positions of the Parties</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the appellant, Mr. Stanfield says that the
    essential issue in this case was whether the prosecutor had proven beyond a
    reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who caused the victim’s injuries. 
    The prosecutor relied on evidence of the appellant’s opportunity to cause the
    injuries and of admissions of responsibility he was alleged to have made to
    K.O., her step-sister, L.C., and to the investigating officer.  The appellant
    denied causing the injuries, making any admissions of responsibility to K.O.,
    likewise to L.C., and explained what he said to the investigating officer in
    the recorded interview after arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As a result of the issue raised at trial, Mr.
    Stanfield continues, it fell to the trial judge to determine whether he
    believed the appellant’s denials or had a reasonable doubt about his guilt as a
    result of what the appellant said.  But the trial judge never did what was
    required of him.  He made no mention of the appellant’s evidence, let alone any
    findings reflecting belief, reasonable doubt or disbelief.  Even if we consider
    that the rejection of the appellant’s denial is implicit in the conviction
    recorded, the record is barren of any findings in connection with the evidence,
    other than the fact that its cumulative effect, to the trial judge’s mind, satisfied
    the prosecutor’s burden of proof.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. Palangio submits that
    the fundamental question is not whether the trial judge incanted the <i>W. (D.)</i> trinity, but whether he understood and properly applied the burden and standard
    of proof to the evidence as a whole.  A review of the trial judge’s reasons as
    a whole, Mr. Palangio says, reveals the trial judge’s firm understanding of the
    relationship between reasonable doubt and the assessment of credibility and its
    proper application in this case. Mr. Palangio points out that the appellant
    does not say that the conviction is unreasonable.  The findings of fact made by
    the trial judge were reasonably based on the evidence adduced at trial. 
    Acceptance of the prosecution’s case of necessity indicates why the defence
    denial was rejected.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The
    Governing Principles</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In cases like this, involving near-equivalent
    opportunity to commit the offence charged and conflicting assertions and
    denials of responsibility, it is crucially important that the trial judge’s
    reasons reveal an understanding of the relationship between reasonable doubt
    and credibility.  The failure expressly to articulate the word formula of <i>W.
    (D.)</i> is not fatal.  What must appear, however, from the reasons as a whole,
    is the trial judge’s clear understanding of the relationship between reasonable
    doubt and the assessment of credibility and its application to the case at
    hand: <i>W. (D.)</i> at p. 758; <i>R. v. Y. (C.L.)</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at
    paras. 7 and 9; <i>R. v. M. (R.E.)</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 46; <i>R.
    v. S. (J.H.)</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 13.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The formula in <i>W. (D.)</i> is <i>not</i> a
    magic incantation, its chant essential to appellate approval and its absence a
    ticket to a new trial.  Its underlying message is that the burden of proof
    resides with the prosecution, must rise to the level of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt in connection with each essential element of the offence, and,
    absent statutory reversal, does not travel to the person charged, even if his
    or her explanation is not believed: <i>S. (J.H.)</i> at para. 13.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            The Principles
    Applied</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To establish the appellant’s guilt, the
    prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, on some
    occasion between June 13 and July 11, 2005, the appellant unlawfully assaulted the
    victim and that, as a consequence, the victim was wounded. To meets its burden,
    in a case in which the victim lived with both her principal caregivers, the
    prosecution focused on two dates when it could show that the appellant had
    exclusive access to the baby: June 26 and July 10, 2005.  Nothing in the nature
    of the injuries themselves pointed more to one parent than to the other.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition to the evidence of exclusive or
    semi-exclusive access to the victim during the specified dates, the prosecutor
    adduced evidence of alleged admissions of responsibility by the appellant to
    his partner, K.O., her step-sister, L.C., and, in an audio and videotaped
    interview, to the lead investigator.  The prosecutor also relied upon expert
    opinion evidence about the age of the injuries based on a healing response
    visible on later X-ray.  This evidence was said to be consistent with
    infliction of the injuries on July 10-11, 2005, although what was proffered was
    a time span, not a date certain.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But there was another side to the story. The
    appellant, unencumbered by prior convictions, testified on his own behalf.  He
    denied having caused the victim’s injuries.  He made <i>no </i>admission of
    responsibility to K.O. and had no recollection of even having spoken to L.C.,
    much less having admitted to her assaulting the baby.  At least implicit in his
    evidence is the suggestion that K.O. caused the injuries.  The appellant also
    explained his answers on police interview and described his state of mind when police
    charged him with the offence and interviewed him about it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The live issue in this case was identity: did
    the prosecutor prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who
    unlawfully caused the injuries to the victim?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The core of the trial judge’s reasons convicting
    the appellant can be found in four paragraphs:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[20] Since then, [K.] has remained
    in the care of the C.A.S. Her mother ceased to live with the accused shortly
    after these events occurred. [K.], therefore, is no longer in the care of
    either of her parents.  On all the evidence, it would seem unlikely that the
    major injuries to [K.], indicated on the radiographs and in the reports of the
    doctors at Hotel Dieu and K.G.H. were sustained at the time of the first period
    in June. On all the evidence, the court considers it most likely that the
    injuries to [K.] which have given rise to these proceedings occurred on the
    night of July 10-11, 2005, when she was in the care of her father.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[21] The accused has made several
    statements of his responsibility for the injuries suffered by [K.].  On July
    22, 2005 he gave a voluntary statement to Detective Constable Andrew Goad of
    the O.P.P. at the Prince Edward O.P.P. Detachment. The statement took the form
    of an audio/visual taped interview. The disc is in evidence as Exhibit 11(A) to
    these proceedings, a transcript prepared by the O.P.P. is Exhibit 11(B). The
    admissibility and voluntariness of the statement has not been contested. Both
    counsel have referred to extracts from the transcript of the statement.  In my
    view, the accused was trying to be truthful throughout the taped interview. At
    no time did he deny applying force to [K.], although he did not mean to hurt
    her “to the extent” she was injured. He repeatedly stated that he would never
    intentionally hurt “anybody”. As an example, at the feeding/changing time at
    2:00 a.m., his evidence was that he “brought out the baby, fed her, changed
    her, and to the best of my recollection, I don’t remember doing anything.”</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[22]     At separate times he told
    the witness, [L.C.], that he had “done this”, (that is applied force to [K.])
    but “not to the extreme of what injuries are described.” On another occasion,
    he admitted to his partner [K.O.], who was berating him about what had happened
    to [K.], asking him, “Why did you do it?”, that he was responsible but “I
    didn’t mean to do it.”</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[23]     After careful
    consideration of all the evidence heard and seen at this trial and of the
    applicable law as I have outlined it this afternoon, I have concluded that the
    Crown has established the essential elements of the offence of aggravated
    assault in this case beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

  <h3><i><span lang=EN-US>The Second Ground:
    Inadequate Reasons</span></i></h3>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            The Positions of
    the Parties</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground of appeal is related to but more expansive than the
    first.  Mr. Stanfield begins with a reminder that the basis upon which a trial
    judge decides a case must be intelligible, at least capable of being made out. 
    The reasons must make apparent a logical connection between the decision
    rendered and the basis for that decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, Mr. Stanfield says, the reasons don’t make the cut.  These
    reasons are at once conclusory and generic.  They betray any analysis of the
    evidence.  They contain no findings of credibility or of reliability.  They
    offer no reason for the rejection of some evidence and acceptance of other
    evidence.  These reasons deprive the appellant of what is his due: meaningful
    appellate review and an understanding of why he was convicted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent characterizes the references to the evidence in the
    reasons of the trial judge as findings of fact.  These findings were reasonably
    open to the trial judge in this uncomplicated case.  The reasons for rejection
    of the appellant’s evidence are obvious once the prosecution’s evidence was
    found credible and reliable. The reasons were adequate in the circumstances.  </p>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial judge’s reasons rendered at the end of a criminal trial must be
    sufficient to fulfil their tripartite functions of explaining why an accused
    was convicted or acquitted, providing public accountability and permitting
    effective appellate review: <i>M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 15.  The reasons are
    sufficient if they respond to the live issues at trial and the key arguments of
    the parties: <i>R. v. Walker</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 245, at para. 20; <i>M.
    (R.E.)</i> at para. 34.  The sufficiency of reasons is not to be measured in
    the abstract, but rather as the reasons respond to the substance of what was in
    issue: <i>Walker</i> at para. 20; <i>M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The degree of detail required in reasons to ensure their sufficiency
    varies with the circumstances of individual cases. Sometimes, for example where
    the basis of the judge’s decision is patent from the record even without
    statement, less detail will be required.  In other instances, such as cases in
    which the trial judge is required to navigate in unsettled legal waters or to
    resolve confused and contradictory evidence on a key issue, more detailed
    reasons are mandated: <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 169, at para. 55; <i>M.
    (R.E.)</i> at para. 44.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution of credibility controversies is the daily fare of trial
    judges.  Assessment of credibility is a difficult and delicate subject, often
    defying precise and complete verbalization.  At bottom, belief of one witness and
    disbelief of another, in general or on a specific issue, is an alloy of
    factors, not a purely intellectual exercise: <i>M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 49; <i>R.
    v. Gagnon</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 20.  The unique position of trial
    judges to see and hear witnesses, and the inestimable advantage they enjoy in
    the result in assessing witnesses’ credibility and the reliability of their
    evidence, cannot be squandered by unrealistic expectations of scientific
    precision in language used to describe the complex coalescence of impressions
    that effuse after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to
    reconcile their renditions of critical events: <i>Gagnon</i> at para. 20.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No uniform standard of detail exists by which we can determine the
    sufficiency of reasons that describe findings on credibility.  The degree of
    detail required to explain these findings will vary with the evidentiary record
    and trial dynamics: <i>M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 51.  Findings on credibility must
    be made with regard to the other evidence in the case, thus the need to make at
    least some reference to the contradictory evidence.  In the end, the detail
    provided must demonstrate that the trial judge has seized the substance of the
    issue in the case tried.  While no detailed account of all conflicting evidence
    is mandated, in a case where credibility is critical, the trial judge must
    direct his or her mind to the decisive question of whether the accused’s
    evidence, considered in the context of all the evidence adduced at trial,
    raises a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt: <i>R. v. Dinardo</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, at paras. 23 and 30; <i>M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 50.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate review of reasons for sufficiency starts with deference to the
    trial judge’s findings of fact.  Appellate intervention must be rooted in a
    functional failing in the trial judge’s reasons for decision.  The reasons,
    read in the context of the evidentiary record and the live issues at trial,
    must fail to reveal an intelligible basis for the verdict, capable of
    permitting meaningful appellate review: <i>Sheppard</i> at para. 28; <i>M.
    (R.E.)</i> at para. 53.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our mandate is to determine the correctness of the trial judge’s
    decision. We apply a functional test, which requires that the trial judge’s
    reasons be sufficient for that purpose.  If we conclude that the deficiencies
    in the reasons prevent meaningful appellate review of the correctness of the
    decision, then the appellant has demonstrated an error of law: <i>M. (R.E.)</i> at para. 52.  Two paragraphs of the reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>M.
    (R.E.)</i> describe the nature of our inquiry. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            [55]     The appellate court,
    proceeding with deference, must ask itself whether the reasons, considered with
    the evidentiary record, the submissions of counsel and the live issues at the
    trial, reveals [<i>sic</i>] the basis for the verdict reached.  It must look at
    the reasons in their entire context. It must ask itself whether, viewed thus,
    the trial judge appears to have seized the substance of the critical issues on
    the trial.  If the evidence is contradictory or confusing, the appellate court
    should ask whether the trial judge appears to have recognized and dealt with
    the contradictions. If there is a difficult or novel question of law, it should
    ask itself if the trial judge has recognized and dealt with that issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            [57]     Appellate courts must ask
    themselves the critical question set out in <i>Sheppard</i>: do the trial
    judge’s reasons, considered in the context of the evidentiary record, the live
    issues as they emerged at trial and the submissions of counsel, deprive the
    appellant of the right to meaningful appellate review?  To conduct meaningful
    appellate review, the court must be able to discern the foundation of the
    conviction. Essential findings of credibility must have been made, and critical
    issues of law must have been resolved.  If the appellate court concludes that
    the trial judge on the record as a whole did not deal with the substance of the
    critical issues on the case (as was the case in <i>Sheppard</i> and <i>Dinardo</i>),
    then, and then only, is it entitled to conclude that the deficiency of the
    reasons constitute [<i>sic</i>] error in law.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The critical factual issue in this case was the identity of the victim’s
    assailant, more particularly the adequacy of the prosecution’s proof that it
    was the appellant who caused the victim’s injuries.  Typically, in cases such
    as this, the infant’s parents have near equal access to the baby during the
    period within which the injuries are caused.  Mother said father did it.  He
    told me so.  Father said he didn’t do it, maybe mother did.  And he didn’t tell
    mother, or mother’s step-sister that he had caused the injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons of the trial judge recapitulate inculpatory parts of the
    evidence of K.O. and L.C. and reiterate some brief portions of the appellant’s
    police interview, commenting upon his failure to deny applying force to the
    victim.  These references aside, what remains in the reasons is at once
    conclusory and generic.  To repeat: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[23]     After careful
    consideration of all the evidence heard and seen at this trial and of the applicable
    law as I have outlined it this afternoon, I have concluded that the Crown has
    established the essential elements of the offence of aggravated assault in this
    case beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Except for the reference to aggravated assault, these
    reasons could apply equally to any other case on any other charge against any
    other accused: <i>R. v. Brown</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 619 (C.A.), at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons make no reference to the appellant’s evidence, including his
    contradiction of the testimony of K.O. and L.C. claiming he admitted
    responsibility for causing the injuries, and betray any appreciation of the
    frailties inherent in the testimony of both K.O. and L.C.  The reasons are devoid
    of any mention of credibility and display no consideration of reliability. We
    know <i>what</i> the trial judge decided, namely that the prosecution had
    proven its case, but we know not<i> why</i> he reached that conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these reasons preclude meaningful appellate review.  It
    follows that the reasons amount to legal error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons also contain two problematic references. The first, an
    apparent finding that the injuries suffered by the victim “most likely”
    occurred during the night of July 10-11, 2005, when the baby was alone with the
    appellant, seems to fall short of the standard of proof required in a criminal
    case: <i>R. v. Lifchus</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at para. 39.  And the second,
    a reference to the failure of the appellant to deny in his police interview
    having applied force to the victim, comes perilously close to attaching
    evidentiary significance to a failure to deny a police allegation, thus
    compromising the right to silence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will defer consideration of the consequences of the insufficiency of
    reasons on the validity of the verdict in this case until later in these
    reasons.  </p>
  <h3><i>&nbsp;</i></h3>
  <h3><i>&nbsp;</i></h3>
  <h3><i>&nbsp;</i></h3>
  <h3><i>The Third Ground: Misapprehension of Evidence</i></h3>
  <h3>            The Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also contends that the trial judge misapprehended portions
    of the evidence adduced at trial. These misapprehensions include a mistake
    about the substance of the evidence, a failure to give proper effect to an item
    of evidence, and a failure to consider evidence relevant to a material issue. 
    The trial judge was mistaken about the substance of the evidence of Dr.
    Soboleski about the age of the victim’s injuries and wrongly characterized the
    appellant’s response on police interview, “I don’t remember doing anything”, as
    a failure to deny the allegations.  He failed to take into account evidence of
    the victim’s condition in deciding when the injuries were inflicted, thus who
    caused them.  Further, the trial judge failed to appreciate that the bruising
    noticed on the victim’s buttocks on July 11, 2005, was not related to either
    the rib or leg fractures, thus could scarcely be used to link the appellant to
    the more serious injuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stanfield argues that these misapprehensions of evidence constitute
    mistakes about the substance of material parts of the evidence and, to the
    extent that the trial judge’s reasons are not otherwise insufficient, played an
    essential part in the reasoning process that resulted in a conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Palangio characterizes the alleged misapprehensions differently. 
    From the respondent’s perspective, what the appellant characterizes as misapprehensions
    of the evidence are simply complaints about the weight the trial judge assigned
    to individual items of evidence, an argument doomed to fail here.  There was no
    misapprehension of the content of the appellant’s police interview – the
    appellant never denied harming the victim, rather only contested the nature and
    extent of force applied and its connection to all the injuries suffered.  The
    other errors amounted to little more than a complaint that the trial judge did
    not refer to all the evidence in his reasons.  He was under no obligation to do
    so.  </p>
  <h3>            The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Misapprehensions of evidence may involve a failure to consider evidence
    relevant to a material issue, mistakes about the substance of evidence, or a
    failure to give proper effect to evidence: <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22
    O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 538.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appellant who advances misapprehension of evidence as a ground of
    appeal against conviction is <i>not</i> entitled to appellate relief upon
    demonstration of a misapprehension, without more. What is required is some link
    or nexus between the misapprehension and the core elements of the judge’s
    reasoning process resulting in a conviction: <i>Morrissey</i> at p. 541.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where misapprehension of evidence is alleged, it becomes necessary to
    determine at the outset whether the claim of misapprehension has been made out.
    The next step involves consideration of the reasonableness of the verdict, an
    argument which, if it succeeds, warrants an acquittal, independently of any
    misapprehension of evidence.  Where the verdict is not unreasonable, then it
    remains to consider whether the misapprehension caused the miscarriage of
    justice: <i>Morrissey</i> at p. 540.</p>
  <h3>            The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons of the trial judge impede informed consideration of this
    ground of appeal.  Suffice it to say that, ceding to the appellant the validity
    of his claims of misapprehension of evidence, I would not conclude that the
    finding of guilt was unreasonable.  A finding of guilt is reasonable if it is a
    verdict that a properly instructed trier of fact, acting judicially, could
    reasonably have rendered. On their own, the misapprehensions of evidence
    advanced here, considered individually and cumulatively, are unlikely to have
    caused a miscarriage of justice.  That said, the misapprehensions provide
    further evidence of the trial judge’s failure to come to grips with the
    substance of the critical issue in the case: the appellant’s responsibility for
    the victim’s injuries.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The failure to give effect to the principles
