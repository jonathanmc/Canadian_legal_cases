  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found guilty by a jury of one count of breaking and
    entering a dwelling house, two counts of robbery with a firearm, two counts of
    discharging a firearm with intent and two counts of aggravated assault.  He was
    sentenced to a total of seven years imprisonment.  He appeals his convictions
    primarily on the ground that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable.  He also
    argues that the jury was not properly instructed on the issue of
    identification.  He does not appeal his sentence.</p>
  <h2>THE EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The convictions arose out of a home invasion at 75 West Avenue North in
    Hamilton on May 18, 2006.  There was no issue concerning the home invasion. 
    Identity was the sole issue at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The house, which was subject to the home invasion, was comprised of
    three apartment units.  Jose Barreira lived with his girlfriend, Amanda Gagne,
    and her four-year-old daughter, Erica Gagne, in the first floor apartment.  Mr.
    Barreira’s son, Josh, lived in the second floor apartment.  The third floor
    apartment was empty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening of the home invasion, Mr. Barreira, Ms. Gagne, Ms.
    Gagne’s daughter and Brytney Roy were in the first floor apartment watching
    television.  Josh Barreira was in the second floor apartment drinking and
    smoking marijuana with five friends.  At approximately 9:00 p.m., three or four
    men entered the first floor apartment through the front door.  Ms. Roy testified
    that there were three men.  Ms. Gagne told the police she saw four men but
    testified at trial that she had seen three.  Mr. Barreira testified that he was
    “pretty sure” he saw four men.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One man said, “This is a robbery” and demanded drugs and money.  Mr. Barreira
    replied that there were neither drugs nor money in the apartment and told the
    men that they could take whatever they wanted from the apartment.  One man took
    Ms. Gagne, her daughter and Ms. Roy into the bedroom while the other men
    searched the apartment.  When the search proved fruitless, one or two of the
    men went upstairs.  They returned with Josh and brought him to the door of the
    first floor apartment while holding a gun to his head.  This incident caused
    Mr. Barreira to react violently against one of the men.  After a brief
    struggle, Mr. Barreira was shot in the leg.  Upon hearing the gunshot, the man
    guarding Ms. Gagne left the bedroom.  The shootings were followed by Ms. Gagne’s
    taking an axe off the wall and striking one of the men with it.  Josh grabbed
    the shooter and was shot in the chest.  The men fled.  Ms. Gagne then retreated
    with her daughter and Ms. Roy to the second floor apartment and called 911.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Barreira testified that he swung a knife at the men while Ms. Gagne wielded
    the axe, which caused the men to run out of the house.  Mr. Barreira gave chase. 
    The last man ran out the front door and leapt over the front of a car parked
    two houses away.  Mr. Barreira described this incident as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was facing my house and he went to my right.  He – like I says, he
    flew over one house to the two neighbours down and grabbed the car, jumped over
    and jumped over a fence.  Like I said, this guy must have had wings.  He was
    terrified at that point.  He was more terrified than I was, so he just like,
    nervous, jumped, ran away.  I threw a knife, never got him.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Right. 
    You said he touched the car and he jumped, jumped over the fence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.
           Well, there was a car there.  There was a car two doors down from me and
    he put his hand on the car and, like I says, he flew over, he just…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Barreira, Ms. Gagne, Ms. Roy and Josh gave different descriptions of
    the men who broke into the apartment.  None of them was able to provide a
    detailed description of the men.  During Ms. Gagne’s testimony, Crown counsel
    pointed out the appellant in the courtroom and asked if Ms. Gagne had ever seen
    the appellant in her house.  The following exchange occurred:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        And with regard to the people that are
    present in court today, there’s an individual behind me to my left, Shevon
    Samuels…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Mm-hmm.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        …had you ever seen that person in your
    house before?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        I believe so.  I believe he was the taller
    one.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        All right.  You believe he was the taller
    one, when?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Pardon me?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        What are you saying?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        I’m saying I believe he’s the taller one
    in my home.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        On the night of the robbery?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>She also testified that the man who took her into the bedroom
    was wearing a bandana over his face.  She conceded in cross-examination that
    she was not sure that the appellant was in her apartment on the night of the
    robbery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel asked Ms. Roy if she had ever seen the appellant before
    May 18, 2006.  She said, “I could have but I don’t know”.  She testified that he
    looked familiar from “his body type and stuff”, but the intruder she thought
    was the appellant was wearing a hooded sweater that only showed a little bit of
    his face.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main evidence against the appellant was a palm print and fingerprint
    on the lower driver’s side corner of the front windshield of the car parked two
    houses away.  The Crown’s expert witness matched the fingerprint with the right
    ring finger of the appellant.  He testified that there was movement in the
    impressions indicating that the impressions had moved from the driver’s side
    toward the passenger’s side of the car.  The owner of the car testified that
    his wife used the car to drive around town.  The appellant had no connection to
    either the car or the house where it was parked.  However, the expert conceded
    that there was no way of telling when the fingerprint was placed on the car;
    the appellant could have placed the fingerprint on the car at some other time
    and in some other part of town.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police investigation revealed a footprint in the mud leading up to
    the car.  There was a dent over the front driver’s side fender, mud on the hood
    and a smudge of dirt on the front windshield. A police officer testified that
    both the dent and mud appeared to be fresh.  The rest of the car appeared to be
    very clean.  The owner of the car testified that when he went to bed at 10:00
    o’clock that evening the car was undamaged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied on two further pieces of evidence.  First, the Crown
    relied on the testimony of Josh’s friend, John Solc.  Mr. Solc testified that
    while he was in the second floor apartment, a tall, skinny black male with a
    bandana around his face came into the apartment and took Josh downstairs.  It
    was the Crown’s position that this person fit the general description of the
    appellant.  Second, the Crown relied on a police officer’s testimony that on
    October 14, 2003, more than three years before the events in issue, he observed
    the appellant in the company of Carlos Nalasco.  Mr. Nalasco was ultimately
    identified as the shooter in this case.  The Crown argued at trial that this evidence
    made it more probable that the appellant’s fingerprint was put on the car
    windshield on May 18, 2006 given the prior association between the two
    individuals.</p>
  <h2>THE ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal submission advanced by the appellant is that the verdict
    was unreasonable.  The appellant also argues that the jury was not properly
    instructed on the issue of identification.  </p>
  <h2><i>(i)        Was the verdict unreasonable?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that this case turns on whether the jury
    could reasonably infer from evidence, other than the fingerprint, that the
    appellant touched the car while fleeing the crime scene.  Counsel argues that
    there was no evidence that makes the inference that the appellant touched the
    car in connection with the home invasion a more likely inference than the
    inference that he touched the car at some other time and place.  She relies on
    an admission made by the Crown’s expert that it was possible that the appellant
    left the fingerprint on the car at some other time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant cites this court’s judgment in <i>R. v. Mars</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), which she submits is on all fours with
    the case at bar.  In <i>Mars</i>, the appellant was convicted of offences
    arising out of a home invasion.  The only evidence connecting the appellant to
    the crimes was a fingerprint found on a pizza box used as a ruse to gain entry
    into the victims’ apartment.  The pizza box was recovered at the doorway of the
    apartment after the robbery.  The appellant was arrested about four months
    later when he was involved in a car accident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mars</i>, the Crown’s fingerprint expert could neither date the
    fingerprint nor offer an opinion on when the fingerprint was placed on the box. 
    He acknowledged that a fingerprint could remain on a surface like the pizza box
    for years.  Mars was convicted at trial solely on the basis of the fingerprint
    evidence; the victims were unable to identify him as a participant in the home
    invasion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A., writing for the court in <i>Mars</i>, said at paras.
    19-21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>[19]     The probative value of fingerprint
    evidence depends on the totality of the evidence.  Fingerprint evidence will
    almost always afford cogent evidence that the person whose fingerprint is left
    on the object touched that object.  However, the ability of the fingerprint
    evidence to connect an accused to the crime charged will depend on whether
    there is other evidence capable of establishing that the accused touched the
    object at the relevant time and place so as to connect the accused to the
    crime.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>[20]     In this case, the fingerprint evidence
    clearly established that the appellant had touched the pizza box at some point
    in time.  However, the probative value of the fingerprint evidence on the charges
    depended upon whether the entirety of the evidence reasonably permitted the
    inference that the appellant touched the pizza box in connection with the
    robbery and not at some other time and place.  The fingerprint evidence
    standing alone did not permit any inference as to when the appellant’s
    fingerprint was placed on the pizza box.  The reasonableness of the verdicts,
    therefore, turns on whether the inference that the appellant touched the pizza
    box in connection with the robbery could reasonably be drawn from the evidence
    other than the fingerprint evidence itself.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>[21]     The evidence does not reasonably permit
    the conclusion that the appellant placed his fingerprint on the pizza box at
    the time of the robbery.  Quite simply, there is no evidence that assists as to
    when the fingerprint was placed on the pizza box.  Put somewhat differently,
    the Crown cannot point to any evidence that makes the inference that the
    appellant touched the pizza box in connection with the robbery a more likely
    inference than the inference that he touched the pizza box at some other time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the other evidence relied upon by the Crown in this case – the in-dock
    identification of Ms. Gagne and Ms. Roy, the identification evidence of Mr.
    Solc and the association evidence between the appellant and Mr. Nalasco – did not
    advance this case in any significant way.  However, unlike <i>Mars</i>, there
    is other evidence capable of permitting a reasonable inference that the palm
    print and fingerprint on the windshield were placed there when one of the
    invaders fled the scene:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of Mr. Barreira that the last man out of the house ran down
    the street and leapt over the front of the car; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of Mr. Barreira that the man grabbed the car as he jumped
    over it; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The palm print and fingerprint faced a direction that was consistent
    with Mr. Barreira’s description of the invader’s flight path.  The opinion of
    the expert witness that the impressions exhibited movement from the driver’s
    side toward the passenger’s side of the car is also consistent with the
    description of the flight path;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The footprint in the mud approaching the car, the fresh dent and the mud
    on the car are consistent with Mr. Barreira’s description of the flight; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the owner of the car that it was undamaged before he
    went to bed on the night of the home invasion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the above evidence together with the fingerprint evidence are
    capable of supporting a reasonable inference that it was the appellant who ran
    from the house at 75 West Avenue North and that he touched the car as he fled
    from the scene of the crime.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the jury was properly instructed and accepted the above
    evidence, the guilty verdicts were ones that the jury could reasonably have
    rendered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the judge’s charge to the jury on identification.</p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       Did the trial judge properly instruct the jury on the issue
    of identification?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to provide any
    instruction on the value of the in-dock identification by Ms. Gagne and Ms. Roy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A perfect charge would have included a reference to the virtually
    useless nature of the in-dock identification by Ms. Gagne and Ms. Roy. 
    However, the jury had the benefit of the standard instruction on the frailties
    of eyewitness identification.  More importantly, the trial judge addressed the
    frailty of the specific evidence in this case.  In particular, the trial judge
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is clear from the evidence of most of the
    witnesses that they could not identify Shevon Rodger Samuels as being one of
    the three or four who appeared at the Barreira residence on May 18<sup>th</sup>,
    2006.  At best, one of the intruders was described as a tall, black man.  <i>This
    is not sufficient identification of this accused.  It is therefore necessary to
    look at other evidence to see if Shevon Rodger Samuels was one of the intruders
    at the Barreira residence on May 18<sup>th</sup>, 2006</i>.  And, as we
    reiterate, Crown counsel must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was
    Shevon Rodger Samuels who committed the offences charged.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for a court of appeal in deciding whether a jury verdict is
    unreasonable is well known:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The function of the court is not to substitute
    itself for the jury, but to decide whether the verdict is one that a properly
    instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>See <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at p. 184, citing <i>R.
    v. Corbett</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275 at p. 282.  In my view, the verdicts of the
    jury in this case meet the test of reasonableness as defined by the Supreme
    Court.  I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
