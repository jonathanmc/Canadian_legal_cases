  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2205305 Ontario Inc. (“220”) was unsuccessful on its urgent motion
    brought on short notice to stay the order of Cumming J. dated July 10, 2009
    approving the sale of certain properties to Pocrnic Realty Advisors Inc. in
    Trust by a receiver appointed pursuant to the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.  The respondents are entitled to their costs of the
    motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents seek an order that Romspen Investment Corporation
    (“Romspen”) be made liable for the costs fixed against 220.  They submit that
    Romspen was “at all times the real moving party”.  They allege that Romspen
    incorporated 220 for the single purpose of attempting to purchase the property
    from the receiver.  Romspen had been a participant throughout the process and was
    to provide 75% of the purchase monies in the transaction.  The respondents
    point out that Romspen’s Managing General Partner, the affiant for all of 220’s
    affidavits, referred to Romspen and 220 interchangeably.  They submit that it
    was Romspen and not 220, that had the largest economic stake in the outcome. 
    They submit that costs assessed against 220 would be an “empty order” as 220
    has no assets.  The receiver advised Romspen, prior to the motion being
    brought, that he would seek costs against both 220 and Romspen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for 220 concedes that Romspen owns 100% of the shares of 220 but
    argues that there is no basis for making a costs order against Romspen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents rely on the decision of Cumming J. in <i>Party City
    Ltd., Re</i>, <span class=canliicitation>32 C.B.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 286, in</span> which he awarded costs against a non-party.  In <i>Party City</i>, a creditor
    brought a motion to set aside an order of the court approving the receiver’s
    sale of the property of the bankrupt.  The respondents rely on Cumming J.’s
    comment that the creditor brought the motion “as a nominee and surrogate” for
    an unsuccessful bidder who was “the real moving party to the motion at hand”,
    and that the moving party may have been “simply a shell corporation and not
    financially able to pay an adverse costs award”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me the respondents read Cumming J.’s decision in <i>Party
    City</i> too broadly.  The moving party in that case, a creditor, had attacked
    the personal integrity of the receiver as well as the integrity of the bidding
    process.  The moving party had acted as the “nominee” and “surrogate” of the
    “real moving party”, an unsuccessful purchaser, in putting forward what Cumming
    J. found was in substance a meritless allegation of actual fraud on the part of
    the receiver.  Cumming J.’s passing remark that the moving party may have been
    “simply a shell corporation and not financially able to pay an adverse costs
    award” was not part of the basis for his decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard for awarding costs against a non-party is set out in <i>Dallas/North
    Group Inc., Re</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 2743 (Ont. C.A.), which Cumming J. relied
    upon in <i>Party City</i>. In <i>Dallas</i> this court upheld the order of the
    bankruptcy judge awarding costs against non-parties.  The bankruptcy judge had
    concluded that the bankruptcy proceeding had been brought for an improper
    collateral purpose.  The true purpose of the proceeding was not to attain the
    distribution of assets but to remove an officer and director of a third-party
    company and reduces shareholdings.  Labrosse J. A. noted at para. 6:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge
    further concluded that it was apparent that there had been a concentrated
    effort orchestrated by [the non-parties] of bullying, harassment and
    intimidation against [one of the litigation parties] and that it was difficult
    to think of a clearer example of petitions in bankruptcy having been brought
    for an improper collateral purpose.  The barrage of proceedings brought against
    [one of the litigation parties] and [Dallas/North Group Inc.] constituted an
    abuse of process and was orchestrated by [the non-parties].  The trial judge
    found it most disturbing that the misconduct of [the non-parties] was carried
    out using the court system as a vehicle and that a lawyer participated in the
    scheme. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Labrosse J. A. made clear that the abuse of the bankruptcy process was
    key to the decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are special
    policy considerations to take into account when dealing with abuse of process
    in bankruptcy court because bankruptcy proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature
    and a petition in bankruptcy can destroy a person’s financial standing and
    reputation. A harsher consequence in costs against a person who misuses the
    bankruptcy court for an improper collateral purpose is therefore justified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case before me is quite different.  Accepting that 220 was
    incorporated for the specific purpose of purchasing the property of the
    bankrupt, its bringing of the motion is consistent with attempting to achieve
    its corporate purpose.  The contention that 220 was acting as a nominee or
    surrogate of sole shareholder, Romspen, is simply an attempt to lift the
    corporate veil.  Cost awards against non-parties always involve the exceptional
    exercise of judicial discretion.  Absent fraud, abuse of the court<span
lang=EN-US>’</span>s process in general and the bankruptcy process in
    particular to serve a collateral purpose or similar wrongdoing, there is no
    basis for looking behind a moving party’s corporate legal personality to award
    costs against its parent.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of this case do not fall into that exceptional class
    of cases where a costs order may be made against a non-party.  In this case the
    moving party, a corporation, brought a motion that it should have recognized
    was doomed to fail.  If the respondents believed it would be unable to pay the
    cost awards that were inevitable, they could have sought security costs before
    the motion proceeded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs are fixed on a partial indemnity scale as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>$2500.00 in favour of the Receiver</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>$1500.00 in favour of Portuguese Canadian Credit
    Union </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>$1500.00 in favour of Pocrnic Realty Advisors Inc.
    in Trust</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>$1000 in favour of the
    other responding parties who attended on the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All amounts include disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
