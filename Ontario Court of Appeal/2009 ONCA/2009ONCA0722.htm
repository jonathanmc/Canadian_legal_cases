  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary issue in this appeal
    involves the limits of the court’s discretion to award costs on either a
    substantial indemnity or full indemnity scale. This court is asked to consider
    a costs award in the amount of $509,452.18, payable by a number of defendants
    in this action to a defendant against which the action was dismissed.  The
    award is notable not only for its considerable quantum, but also for the trial
    judge’s decision to fix a large portion of the costs on a full indemnity basis
    absent a finding of sanction-worthy conduct on the part of the party against
    which the cost order was made.  Specifically, full indemnity costs were ordered
    for the period following the delivery of an offer to settle the claims of the
    plaintiff and other defendants on a without-costs basis.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons that follow, I
    would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the costs award below,
    and substitute an award in the amount of $300,000 plus disbursements and Goods
    and Services Tax.</p>
  <h2>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background Facts</h2>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This action, commenced on
    September 5, 2000, arose out of a train derailment that took place in
    Bowmanville on November 23, 1999.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 10, 2002, Blue Circle
    Canada Inc., one of the defendants and the respondent in this appeal, delivered
    a non-severable offer to settle consenting to a dismissal of the claim and all
    counterclaims and cross-claims, without costs.  This offer remained open for
    acceptance for 30 days.  On February 1, 2005, Blue Circle delivered a second
    offer on the same terms (the “February 2005 offer”).  This offer was never
    revoked and was open for acceptance at the time of trial. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial, on the issue of
    liability only, began in April 2005 and continued for almost 11 weeks.  In this
    complex action, eight parties advanced claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims
    in contract and in tort.  Prior to closing arguments, settlement discussions
    took place, at the end of which the defendants/appellants in this appeal, the
    Corporation of the Municipality of Clarington, Via Rail Canada Inc., Canadian
    National Railway Company, The BLM Group Inc., Timothy Garnham, Apache
    Specialized Equipment Inc., Apache Transportation Services Inc., and Hydro One
    Networks Inc. (collectively, the “settling defendants”), settled with the
    plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the settlement
    discussions, Blue Circle offered to accept $250,000 from the settling
    defendants in relation to costs it incurred in defending their cross-claims. 
    It subsequently reduced this amount to $200,000.  This offer was not accepted
    and consequently Blue Circle did not participate in the settlement.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the trial judge had
    to determine Blue Circle’s liability, if any, for damages arising from the
    derailment.  On April 5, 2006, after hearing final arguments, the trial judge
    dismissed the action against Blue Circle.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue Circle then sought costs
    against the settling defendants on a partial indemnity scale from the
    commencement of the litigation to the February 2005 offer and on a substantial
    indemnity basis thereafter.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 19, 2007, upon
    considering written argument, the trial judge ordered the settling defendants
    to pay Blue Circle’s costs in the amount of $509,452.18 plus disbursements of
    $26,276.77.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>The
    Applicable Rules</b></p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The award of costs is governed by section
    131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c.43 and by rules 49 and
    57.01 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general source of judicial
    discretion to award costs is found under s.131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    as expanded by rule 57.01.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 131 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i> says:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Subject to the
    provisions of an Act or rules of court, the costs of and incidental to a
    proceeding or a step in a proceeding are in the discretion of the court, and the
    court may determine by whom and to what extent the costs shall be paid.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[13]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 57.01 reads as follows<b>:</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In exercising its
    discretion under section 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> to award
    costs, the court may consider, in addition to the result in the proceeding <i>and
    any offer to settle or to contribute made in writing,</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i> </i>(0.a) the principle of indemnity, including, where
    applicable, the experience of the lawyer for the party entitled to the costs as
    well as the rates charged and the hours spent by that lawyer;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(0.b) the amount of
    costs that an unsuccessful party could reasonably expect to pay in relation to
    the step in the proceeding for which costs are being fixed;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) the complexity of
    the proceeding;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> (e) the conduct of
    any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of
    the proceeding. (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 57.01(4)
    allows for elevated levels of costs:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><a name="P6562_493503"></a><a name=s57p01s4></a>57.01(4) Nothing in this rule or rules 57.02 to 57.07
    affects the authority of the court under section 131 of the Courts of Justice
    Act,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) to award all or
    part of the costs on a substantial indemnity basis;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d) to award costs in
    an amount that represents full indemnity.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[15]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Substantial indemnity costs” is
    defined in rule 1.03 as “costs awarded in an amount that is 1.5 times what
    would otherwise be awarded in accordance with Part I of Tariff A”.  This part
    of Tariff A was once the prescribed grid for “partial indemnity costs”, but is
    no longer in effect.  “Full indemnity costs” is not a defined term but is
    generally considered to be complete reimbursement of all amounts a client has
    had to pay to his or her lawyer in relation to the litigation: see M. Orkin, <i>The
    Law of Costs</i>, looseleaf, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book,
    1993) at para. 219.05.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[16]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 49 deals with a specific
    aspect of costs: it is a self-contained scheme that addresses the manner in
    which offers to settle are brought into play.  Its objective is to promote an
    offer of compromise and visit a cost consequence upon an offeree who rejects an
    offer that turns out to be as favourable as or more favourable than the
    judgment awarded to a plaintiff at trial.  The parts of rule 49 relevant to
    this analysis are:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>49.02(1) A party to a proceeding may serve on any other
    party an offer to settle any one or more of the claims in the proceeding on the
    terms specified in the offer to settle </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><a name="P5951_416849"></a><a name=s49p10s1></a>49.10(1) Where
    an offer to settle,</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) is not withdrawn
    and does not expire before the commencement of the hearing; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) is not accepted
    by the defendant,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>and the plaintiff
    obtains a judgment as favourable as or more favourable than the terms of the
    offer to settle, the plaintiff is entitled to partial indemnity costs to the
    date the offer to settle was served and substantial indemnity costs from that
    date, unless the court orders otherwise. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Defendant’s Offer</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><a name="P5957_417473"></a><a name=s49p10s2></a>(2) Where an offer to settle,</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>and the plaintiff
    obtains a judgment as favourable as or less favourable than the terms of the
    offer to settle, the plaintiff is entitled to partial indemnity costs to the
    date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to partial indemnity
    costs from that date, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>49.13 Despite rules 49.03, 49.10 and 49.11, the
    court, in exercising its discretion with respect to costs, may take into
    account any offer to settle made in writing, the date the offer was made and
    the terms of the offer.</p>
  <h2>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasons of the Trial Judge
    regarding Blue Circle’s Costs</h2>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[17]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her endorsement relating to
    Blue Circle’s costs, the trial judge briefly set out the nature and history of
    the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[18]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing her assessment of
    Blue Circle’s disbursements that were in issue, the trial judge turned to Blue
    Circle’s submissions concerning fees.  She noted Blue Circle’s two offers to
    consent to a dismissal of the claims and cross-claims on a without-costs basis
    and its offers made to the settling defendants during the course of the
    settlement discussions.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[19]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge identified the
    principles and authorities upon which Blue Circle relied in support of its
    claim for partial indemnity costs to the date of the February 2005 offer and
    substantial indemnity costs thereafter.  Blue Circle relied upon the wide
    discretionary power in s. 131 of the<i> Courts of Justice Act</i> and rules
    49.13 and 57.01(1) and (4) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> as well as
    this court’s decisions in<i> S &amp; A Strasser Ltd. v. Richmond Hill (Town)</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 243, and the Ontario Court (General Division) decision in <i>Apotex
    Inc. v. Egis Pharmaceuticals</i> (1990), 2 O.R. (3d) 126.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[20]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her analysis, the trial judge
    identified the principles established in the two well-known cases of<i> Boucher
    v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario </i>(2004), 71 O.R.
    (3d) 291 (C.A.), and <i>Moon v. Sher</i> (2004), 246 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    440 (Ont. C.A.).  The principles are that the fixing of costs is not merely a
    mechanical exercise; that the result of applying the costs grid must be
    considered, in particular whether in all the circumstances the result is fair
    and reasonable<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>;
    and that in deciding what is fair and reasonable, the expectation of the
    parties is a relevant factor.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[21]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At para. 22 of her reasons, the
    trial judge analyzed the factors set out in rule 57.01(1) that she considered
    relevant to her determination as to costs:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am now going to
    look at the 57.01(1) factors applicable to this case:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(0.a) The lawyers
    were all senior experienced members of the bar – no doubt the best in this area
    of law.  The rates charged and the hours expended are reasonable.  There is no
    reason why there should not be full indemnity following the service of the
    offer and partial indemnity of the earlier fees.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(0.b) The amount of
    costs being sought by Blue Circle would have been reasonably expected by the
    parties.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) The case was very
    complex.  Even the sole issue which had to be determined in the end was very
    complex.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(e) The conduct of
    Blue Circle – I agree that counsel for Blue Circle often played a mediating
    role.  Difficult issues erupted at the trial and usually Mr. Brock, who was not
    involved in the “erupting” issue, offered some practical and helpful thoughts. 
    I was not present in the settlement discussions but have no doubt that he was
    an integral part in arriving at the settlement.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[22]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in paras. 23 and 24, the
    trial judge fixed Blue Circle’s costs as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.       “Partial indemnity costs” from the
    commencement of the action to February 1, 2005, in the amount of $53,867.10;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.       “Substantial indemnity costs” from February
    1, 2005 to the date of the costs decision, in the amount of $455,585.08.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[23]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her reasons the trial judge
    used the terms “substantial” and “full” interchangeably with respect to the
    scale of costs.  However, the $455,585.08 awarded is the aggregate of all of
    the invoices Blue Circle paid its counsel for fees incurred after February
    2005.  Thus, while the trial judge appears to have intended to order Blue
    Circle its costs on a substantial indemnity basis, the amount awarded was on a
    full indemnity scale. 
    Although this amounts to an error, it has no bearing on my analysis or the
    outcome of this appeal.  For simplicity,
    throughout the rest of my reasons I will refer to both full and substantial
    indemnity costs generically as “elevated costs”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>The Issues</b></p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[24]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The settling defendants appeal on
    a narrow basis. They take the position that Blue Circle is entitled to its
    costs throughout, on a partial indemnity basis, and to the disbursements
    awarded by the trial judge.  Their complaint lies in the trial judge’s having
    awarded Blue Circle elevated costs from the February 2005 offer to the date of
    judgment as well as in the overall amount of the award.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[25]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The settling defendants submit
    that the trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in awarding
    elevated costs for this period, in two respects:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)     in effectively treating Blue Circle’s February
    2005 offer to settle as though it were a rule 49.10 offer; and,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)     in relying on <i>Strasser</i> in support of
    her conclusion that Blue Circle was entitled to elevated costs from the
    February 2005 offer forward.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[26]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The settling defendants further
    argue that the trial judge erred in ordering costs in an amount that is not
    “fair and reasonable” according to the principles set out in <i>Boucher.</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b>V.      Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[27]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties take no issue with the
    general principles applicable to appellate review of costs decisions.  The
    Supreme Court has made it clear that a costs award should be set aside on
    appeal only if the trial judge erred in principle or if the award was plainly
    wrong: see <i>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at
    para. 27. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='page-break-after:avoid'><i>(1) </i><i><u>The
    Costs Award on an Elevated Scale</u></i></p>
  <h2>The Jurisprudential Framework </h2>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt style='
page-break-after:avoid'>[28]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first issue is whether the
    trial judge erred in relying on the February 2005 offer as justification for an
    elevated costs award. This court, following the principle established by the
    Supreme Court, has repeatedly said that elevated costs are warranted in only
    two circumstances.  The first involves the operation of an offer to settle
    under rule 49.10, where substantial indemnity costs are explicitly authorized.
    The second is where the losing party has engaged in behaviour worthy of
    sanction. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[29]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Young v.
    Young, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 134, McLachlin J., described the
    circumstances when elevated costs are warranted as “only where there has been
    reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of one of the
    parties.”</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same principle was expanded
    upon in <i>Mortimer v. Cameron </i>(1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at p.23,
    where Robins J. A., speaking for the court, set out the restricted
    circumstances in which a higher costs scale is appropriate with reference to
    Orkin at para. 219.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:
normal'>An award of costs on the
    solicitor-and-client scale, it has been said, is ordered only in rare and
    exceptional cases to mark the court’s disapproval of the conduct of a party in
    the litigation.  The principle guiding the decision to award
    solicitor-and-client costs has been enunciated thus:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[S]olicitor-and-client costs should not be awarded
    unless there is some form of reprehensible conduct, either in the circumstances
    giving rise to the cause of action, or in the proceedings, which makes such
    costs desirable as a form of chastisement. <a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[31]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The narrow grounds justifying a
    higher costs scale were further reinforced by Abella J.A. in <i>McBride Metal
    Fabricating Corp. v. H. &amp; W. Sales Co.</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 97 where,
    at para. 39, she said:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:
normal'>Apart from the operation of Rule 49.10
    (introduced to promote settlement offers), only conduct of a reprehensible
    nature has been held to give rise to an award of solicitor-and-client costs. 
    In the cases in which they were awarded there were specific acts or a series of
    acts that clearly indicated an abuse of process, thus warranting costs as a
    form of chastisement.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>See also: <i>Walker v. Ritchie </i>(2005), 197 O.A.C.
    81 at para. 105, reversed on other grounds, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 428.  </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[32]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At para. 14 of the reasons, the
    trial judge acknowledges the parties’ agreement that rule 49 was not applicable
    to Blue Circle’s February offer.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[33]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leaves egregious conduct,
    specifically the question whether in the circumstances of this case the
    settling defendants engaged in conduct worthy of sanction.</p>
  <h2>Strasser</h2>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[34]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This takes me to <i>Strasser,</i> the
    case upon which the trial judge relied in awarding an elevated scale of costs following
    the February 2005 offer to settle and upon which Blue Circle heavily relies in
    this appeal.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[35]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Strasser</i>, the plaintiff
    had originally claimed $1,000,000.  After discovery, the defendant offered to
    pay $30,000.  The plaintiff then reduced the claim to $70,000.  The action was
    ultimately dismissed.  In those circumstances, the trial judge awarded the
    defendant solicitor-and-client costs, throughout.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[36]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the plaintiff’s appeal of the
    costs award, Carthy J.A., for the court, noted that although the defendant’s
    offer was not a rule 49.10 offer, the language of rules 49.13 and 57.01 gives
    the trial judge discretion with respect to costs, and rule 49.13 specifically
    invites the judge exercising discretion to take into account any offer to
    settle made in writing.  Carthy J.A. went on, however, to hold that the offer
    in <i>Strasser</i> could not, standing on its own, justify an award of
    solicitor-and-client costs.  While the trial judge did not identify any
    evidence of reprehensible conduct, Carthy J.A., in upholding the award, was
    careful to note that during the costs submissions the trial judge did say “I
    think this case, in these circumstances, screams for solicitor-and-client
    costs:” p. 246.  </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[37]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This court sought to clarify <i>Strasser </i>in <i>Scapillati v. A. Potvin Construction Ltd</i>. (1999), 44 O.R. (3d)
    737, a case in which the defendant had served an offer to settle on the basis
    that the action be dismissed without costs and the trial judge subsequently
    dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.  Purportedly following<i> Strasser</i>, the
    trial judge awarded party-and-party costs to the date of the offer and solicitor-and-client
    costs thereafter.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[38]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal, this court started its
    analysis of the defendant’s appeal of the costs award by observing, once again,
    that as the plaintiff’s claim had failed, rule 49.10 had no application.  Then,
    at p. 750, turning to <i>Strasser</i>, Austin J.A. had this to say:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he principle upon
    which solicitor and client costs were awarded in <i>Strasser </i>is a very
    narrow one.  The plaintiff had made a claim for $1 million, the defendant made
    an offer after discovery of $30,000 and the action was dismissed at trial.  In
    the instant case, no similar offer was made.  While the trial judge in the
    instant case made an award of solicitor and client costs, it does not appear
    from the record that she felt as strongly about it as the trial judge in <i>Strasser</i> who said “I think this case, in these circumstances, screams for solicitor and
    client costs.”</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[39]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus interpreting <i>Strasser </i>as
    a case where egregious conduct was implicitly found, this court allowed the
    appeal as to costs, set aside the original costs award and substituted an award
    of costs on a party-and-party basis.  For other cases in which comments have
    been made on the limited application of <i>Strasser</i>, see <i>St.
    Louis-Lalonde v. Carlton Condominium Corporation No. 12 </i>(2005), 142
    A.C.W.S. (3d) 934 (Ont. S.C.) aff’d 155 A.C.W.S. (3d) 479 (C.A.), at para. 15, <i>Dyer
    v. Mekinda Snyder Partnership Inc. </i>(1998)<i>, </i>40 O.R. (3d) 180 (Ct. J.
    (Gen. Div.)).</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[40]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, while fixing costs is a discretionary exercise,
    attracting a high level of deference, it must be on a principled basis.  The judicial discretion under rules 49.13 and 57.01 is
    not so broad as to permit a fundamental change to the law that governs the
    award of an elevated level of costs.  Apart from the operation of rule 49.10, elevated
    costs should <i>only</i> be awarded on a clear finding of reprehensible conduct
    on the part of the party against which the cost award is being made.  As Austin
    J.A. established in <i>Scapillati</i>, <i>Strasser</i> should be interpreted to
    fit within this framework - as a case where the trial judge implicitly found
    such egregious behaviour, deserving of sanction. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>Application to the Facts</b></p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt style='
page-break-after:avoid'>[41]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the circumstances are
    similar to those found in <i>S</i><i>capillati.  </i>There was no rule 49.10 offer and no
    finding by the trial judge that the
    settling defendants conducted themselves in a reprehensible or egregious
    fashion.  </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue Circle submits that
    notwithstanding the trial judge’s failure to make such a finding in her reasons
    as to costs, her reasons dismissing the claim against it demonstrate that the
    settling defendants’ conduct in relentlessly pursuing their claims against Blue
    Circle, in the face of the apparent weakness of their position, is conduct that
    justifiably attracted an elevated scale of costs. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[43]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have considerable difficulty
    with this argument.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[44]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue Circle’s submission in this
    respect is contrary to the principle Dubin J.A. expressed in <i>Foulis v.
    Robinson</i> (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 at p. 776 that  “Under our system
    defendants are entitled to put the plaintiff to the proof, and there is no
    obligation to settle an action.”</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[45]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, a distinction must be
    made between hard-fought litigation that turns out to have been misguided, on
    the one hand, and malicious counter-productive conduct, on the other.  The
    former, the thrust and parry of the adversary system, does not warrant
    sanction: the latter well may.  In <i>Apotex v. Egis Pharmaceuticals </i>(1991),<i> </i>4 O.R. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.J.), substantial indemnity costs were justified as
    a means “to discourage harassment of another party by the pursuit of fruitless litigation...particularly
    where a party has conducted itself improperly in the view of this court.” For other
    examples of abuses of process leading to elevated costs, see<i> Dyer </i>at
    pp.184 - 85.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[46]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, there is no finding or
    evidence in the record of “harassment…by the pursuit of fruitless litigation”. 
    The settling defendants were entitled to advance their position; they were not
    required to settle.  In the end, the trial judge did not agree with their
    position but the settling defendants did nothing to abuse the process of the
    court.  In short, there was no wrongdoing on the part of the settling
    defendants that warranted a rebuke from the court.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[47]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Apotex </i>(1990) does not assist Blue Circle in trying to make
    out a case for misconduct on the part of the settling defendants.  That case
    involved meritless claims of fraud, deceit, and dishonesty based on pure
    speculation.  First, the trial judge did not make such a link between this case
    and <i>Apotex</i> (1990) on this basis.  Second, unsubstantiated allegations of
    the nature advanced in <i>Apotex</i> (1990) represent a form of egregious
    conduct commonly accepted as a basis for attracting a higher costs award: see <i>131843
    Canada Ltd. V. Double “R” (Toronto) Ltd.</i> (1992), 7 C.P.C. (3d) 15 (Ont. Ct.
    (Gen. Div.)); <i>Réno-Dépôt Inc. v. Wonderland
    Commercial Centre Inc</i>., 2008 ONCA 786
    (award of costs on a substantial indemnity basis warranted only from the point
    in time when allegations of fraud and dishonesty were made).  This is not the nature of the allegations made
    against the settling defendants.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[48]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before turning to the settling
    defendants’ second argument, I make one final comment.  In cases such as <i>Beresford-Last (Litigation
    Guardian of) v. Dworak</i> (2000), 101 A.C.W.S. (3d) 696 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), and <i>Marcella v. Integrated
    Management and Investments Inc.</i> (2007), 157 A.C.W.S. (3d) 51 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), trial judges have expressed the
    view that denying elevated costs to defendants who submit an offer to settle,
    which is later revealed to be more favourable than the result at trial, acts as
    a disincentive to defendants to make reasonable offers to settle.  This view,
    while understandable, is contrary to the wording, spirit and intent of rule
    49.  Rules cannot be incrementally
    changed through jurisprudence.  Any
    change in the rules to take into account the position of defendants who
    legitimately try to curtail what turns out to be unnecessary litigation is a matter for the Rules Committee.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[49]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, there is no basis to
    justify anything other than a partial indemnity costs award in favour of Blue Circle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><i>(2) <u>Whether the costs award is
    “fair and reasonable”</u></i></p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[50]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this conclusion is
    sufficient to set aside the costs award, I would add that, in my view, the
    award was otherwise not fair and reasonable.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[51]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Andersen v. St. Jude Medical
    Inc.</i> (2006), 264 D.L.R. (4th) 557, the Divisional Court set out several
    principles that must be considered when awarding costs:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discretion of the court must
    be exercised in light of the specific facts and circumstances of the case in
    relation to the factors set out in rule 57.01(1): <i>Boucher</i>, <i>Moon, </i>and <i>Coldmatic Refrigeration of Canada Ltd. v. Leveltek Processing LLC </i>(2005),
    75 O.R. (3d) 638 (C.A.).</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A consideration of experience,
    rates charged and hours spent is appropriate, but is subject to the overriding
    principle of reasonableness as applied to the factual matrix of the particular
    case: <i>Boucher</i>. The quantum should reflect an amount the court considers
    to be fair and reasonable rather than any exact measure of the actual costs to
    the successful litigant: <i>Zesta
    Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier</i> (2002), 119 A.C.W.S. (3d) 341 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 4.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasonable expectation of the
    unsuccessful party is one of the factors to be considered in determining an
    amount that is fair and reasonable: rule 57.01(1)(0.b).</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>4.       The court
    should seek to avoid inconsistency with comparable awards in other cases.
    &quot;Like cases, [if they can be found], should conclude with like substantive
    results&quot;: <i>Murano v. Bank of Montreal </i>(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 222
    (C.A.), at p. 249.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>5.       The court
    should seek to balance the indemnity principle with the fundamental objective
    of access to justice: <i>Boucher</i>. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[52]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As can be seen, the overriding
    principle is reasonableness.  If the judge fails to consider the reasonableness
    of the costs award, then the result can be contrary to the fundamental
    objective of access to justice.  Rather than engage in a purely mathematical
    exercise, the judge awarding costs should reflect on what the court views as a
    reasonable amount that should be paid by the unsuccessful party rather than any
    exact measure of the actual costs of the successful litigant.  In <i>Boucher, </i>this
    court emphasized the importance of fixing costs in an amount that is fair and
    reasonable for the unsuccessful party to pay in the particular proceeding at
    para. 37, where Armstrong J.A. said “[t]he failure to refer, in assessing
    costs, to the overriding principle of reasonableness, can produce a result that
    is contrary to the fundamental objective of access to justice.”</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[53]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, while the trial judge
    identified the importance of a reasonableness assessment, with respect, in
    arriving at a costs award of $509,452.18 her reasons do not indicate that she
    conducted an assessment or at least a sufficient one, in accordance the
    requirements set out in Boucher.  Furthermore, although the trial judge did
    find that the parties would have reasonably expected Blue Circle to have <i>claimed </i>costs of this magnitude, she was, according to <i>Boucher</i> at para. 38,
    obliged to consider the expectations of the parties concerning the quantum of
    the costs <i>award</i>. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[54]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to accept that the
    settling defendants would have expected that they would be faced with an award against
    them of this magnitude particularly in the light of Blue Circle’s limited
    involvement in the proceedings.  Blue Circle did not participate in the
    examination or cross-examination of any witnesses.  In Blue Circle’s own costs
    submissions, it is acknowledged that their case took two hours in total to put
    in.  The parties could not have expected that the trial judge would treat the
    costs incurred after the February 2005 offer in the manner she did.  They could
    not have expected that, through an elevated costs award, the trial judge would effectively
    reward Blue Circle for the assistance its counsel provided during the
    settlement discussions.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> 
    Further, in considering the expectations of the parties, it is appropriate to
    compare the costs claimed by and awarded to the various parties.  The trial
    judge awarded Blue Circle an amount in legal fees that was almost double those
    that were received by the plaintiffs.  The settling defendants could not have
    anticipated a disparity of this nature.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[55]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of this “fair and
    reasonable” analysis demonstrate that appellate intervention is warranted.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[56]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to quantum, taking into
    consideration the circumstances of this case and applying to them the relevant
    factors set out in rule 57.01, and the fair and reasonable test expressed in
    Boucher, in my view the amount of $300,000 would be appropriate. </p>
  <h2>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disposition </h2>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[57]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore allow the appeal
    and set aside the trial judge’s cost award in relation to fees only and in its
    place substitute the amount of $300,000.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeadingNumber14pt>[58]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the agreement of the parties,
    the settling defendants are entitled to their costs of this appeal and the
    motion for leave to appeal, fixed in the amount of $10,000 including
    disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. </p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The costs grid has since been removed from the rules, but the general point is
    clear; the result of a costs award formula must be scrutinized for fairness and
    reasonableness.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Note the discrepancy in language between the former terminology, “solicitor and
    client costs” and the newer terminology of “substantial indemnity.”  The two
    terms indicate the same costs scale.  Rule 1.04 identifies the two terms as
    follows: “If a statute, regulation or other document
    refers to solicitor and client costs, these rules apply as if the reference
    were to substantial indemnity costs.”</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><a
href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> While the assistance of counsel for Blue Circle
    in the discussions that led to the settlement among all but Blue Circle is
    commendable, it is not, in my view, a basis upon which to make the settling
    defendants pay Blue Circle’s costs on an elevated basis.</p>
