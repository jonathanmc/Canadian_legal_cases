style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party, Sarkis Keuroghlian, asks to set aside the order of the
    Registrar dismissing his appeal for delay and for a reasonable period of time
    to perfect his appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The responding party, Goodmans LLP, acted for
    Mr. Keuroghlian at a trial in late November 2005.  When Mr. Keuroghlian did not
    pay his outstanding accounts, Goodmans assessed its fees.  On January 26, 2009,
    the Assessment Officer concluded that Mr. Keuroghlian owed Goodmans
    approximately $400,000 in fees.  On April 14, 2009, Pollak J. dismissed Mr.
    Keuroghlian’s appeal of the assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 6, 2009 – within the time prescribed for
    appealing – Mr. Keuroghlian filed a notice of appeal to this court from the
    decision of the motion judge.  As the transcripts were already available and
    thus no evidence needed to be transcribed, Mr. Keuroghlian was required to
    perfect his appeal within 30 days.  He did not do so, but he was then self-represented.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 8, 2009, the Registrar of this court
    issued a notice of intention to dismiss Mr. Keuroghlian’s appeal for delay if
    it was not perfected by June 30.  Mr. Keuroghlian immediately retained Mr. Apel
    to represent him on the appeal.  Mr. Apel then sought an extension of time
    beyond the June 30 deadline.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 30, Mr. Apel and counsel for Goodmans
    agreed on a 20-day extension, and so notified the Registrar.  However, the
    appeal was still not perfected within this additional 20-day period.  On July
    24, the Registrar dismissed Mr. Keuroghlian’s appeal for delay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After counsel for Goodmans refused to consent to
    setting aside this order, Mr. Keuroghlian brought this motion.  He did not
    serve his material until September 10, 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 16, 2009, Harvison Young J. granted
    summary judgment against Mr. Keuroghlian’s wife and daughter on guarantees in
    the amount of $350,000, which they had given to Goodmans shortly before the
    trial on account of its fees.  Harvison Young J. stayed the enforcement of the
    summary judgment pending my decision.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Various cases have itemized a list of
    considerations relevant to the question whether a court should exercise its
    discretion to set aside a Registrar’s order: Has the moving party
    satisfactorily explained the delay? Did the moving party miss the deadline
    because of inadvertence? Did the moving party bring its motion promptly? Is the
    respondent party prejudiced?  Depending on the case, these considerations
    provide useful criteria for structuring the court’s discretion.  However, the
    overriding question is simply whether, after taking account of the interests of
    both parties, setting aside the Registrar’s order is just: see <i>Scaini v.
    Prochnicki</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 179 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it would not be just to set aside
    the Registrar’s order.  Admittedly, the delay – about three and a half months –
    is not unduly long, and for part of that period Mr. Keuroghlian did not have a
    lawyer.  What weigh heavily against Mr. Keuroghlian’s position, however, are
    the delay after he was represented, the unsatisfactory explanation for that
    delay and the absence of any evidence that he has taken a single step to
    perfect his appeal since June 30.  The following considerations are, in my
    view, determinative:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Through his counsel, Mr. Keuroghlian
    acknowledged that by June 30 he had all the materials he needed to perfect his
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By June 30, Mr. Keuroghlian was already almost a
    month late in perfecting his appeal.  He accepted and agreed to a further 20-day
    extension.  In agreeing to this extension, Mr. Keuroghlian must be taken to be
    on notice that if he wanted to preserve his appeal rights he had to get his
    appeal materials in order immediately.  I add that although the underlying
    appeal materials are not before me, I doubt that the appeal itself was so complex
    that it required additional time.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Not only did Mr. Keuroghlian fail to perfect his
    appeal within the 20-day extension he had agreed to, he gave no credible
    explanation for his failure to do so.  He, or more accurately, an articling
    student in his lawyer’s office, states only that “in addition to managing and
    maintaining his busy legal practice, preparing and perfecting an appeal is an
    onerous and time consuming task”.  I recognize the demands on a sole practitioner,
    but having agreed to this extension and having offered no evidence that
    anything was done to perfect the appeal in the 20 days, this explanation rings
    hollow.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, after the Registrar’s July 24 order,
    Mr. Keuroghlian waited a month and a half before moving to set it aside.  This
    does not qualify as moving promptly.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, I infer from the silence of Mr. Keuroghlian’s
    affidavit material that in the two-month period between the Registrar’s order
    and the argument of this motion, he still took no steps to perfect his appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the light of these considerations, I dismiss
    Mr. Keuroghlian’s motion.  I do so without taking into account Goodmans’
    assertion that it is now prejudiced because of the conditional stay granted by
    Harvison Young J.  Goodmans is entitled to its costs of the motion, which I fix
    at $3,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</span></p>
