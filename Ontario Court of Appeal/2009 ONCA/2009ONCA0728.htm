  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The United States of America seeks the extradition of the respondent
    Sang Hoon Lee for his participation in a human smuggling operation that
    unlawfully brought Korean and Chinese nationals into the United States via
    Canada without the legally required documents.  On September 9, 2008, Molloy J.
    found insufficient evidence in the Record of the Case to warrant the
    respondent’s committal for extradition and thus discharged him.  The Attorney
    General of Canada, on behalf of the United States, appeals that decision.  For
    the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 7, 2008, the Minister of Justice of Canada issued an
    Authority to Proceed authorizing the Attorney General of Canada to seek an
    order committing the respondent for extradition.  It contained two offences
    under Canadian law that correspond to the alleged conduct of the respondent for
    which he is sought to be prosecuted in the United States.  These offences are
    as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Organize, induce, aid or abet the coming
    into Canada of one or more persons who are not in possession of a visa,
    passport or other document required by the <i>Immigration and Refugee
    Protection Act</i> contrary to section 117 of that Act; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Conspiracy to organize, induce, aid or
    abet the coming into Canada of one or more persons who are not in possession of
    a visa, passport or other document required by the <i>Immigration and Refugee
    Protection Act</i> contrary to s. 117 of that Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal
    Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 117(1) of the <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,</i> S.C. 2001, c. 27 (“<i>IRPA</i>”<i>)</i> reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No person shall knowingly organize, induce, aid or
    abet the coming into Canada of one or more persons who are not in possession of
    a visa, passport or other document required by this Act.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        THE DECISION APPEALED FROM</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the Authority to Proceed, the Attorney General of Canada
    sought an order of committal from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the extradition judge, the respondent agreed that he was the
    person sought for extradition, so identity was not at issue.  The Record of the
    Case prepared by the United States included the certification by an Assistant
    United States Attorney that the evidence summarized or contained in it is
    available for trial, and is sufficient under the laws of the United States to
    justify prosecution.  It also contained clear and uncontested evidence that the
    respondent had received a bus ticket and $2000 from a Mr. Jeong who instructed
    him to go to Burlington, Vermont, and once there, rent a car and pick up foreign
    nationals who had crossed the border and transport them to another location in
    Vermont.  The respondent was arrested while transporting them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question addressed by the extradition judge was whether, for either
    charge, the Record of the Case contained any evidence beyond this, from which a
    trier of fact could reasonably draw an inference of guilt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge first considered the charge under s. 117(1) of the <i>IRPA</i>.  She held that the only evidence against the respondent was that
    he was a driver for the smuggling operation who, on one occasion, transported
    individuals who had entered the United States illegally from one point in
    Vermont to another, and that this alone was insufficient to commit the
    respondent for assisting them to enter the country unlawfully.  She decided
    that the evidence that the respondent was also a guide for the smuggling
    operation did not permit a reasonable inference that he actually assisted
    persons to unlawfully enter the country and found that there was no other
    evidence of his assistance.  She thus concluded that there was no evidence upon
    which the respondent could be found guilty as a principal of the offence under
    s. 117(1) of the <i>IRPA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge then turned to whether the respondent’s role as driver
    within the United States was enough for a conviction under s. 117(1) as an
    aider or abettor.  On the basis of <i>R. v. Bell</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 471, a
    case involving the importing of a narcotic, she found that the offence of
    unlawfully entering the country was complete once the individual crossed the
    border.  The act of picking up and transporting such a person after that point
    was therefore not aiding or abetting the commission of the offence, since the
    offence was already complete.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge then considered the evidence before her in the
    context of the conspiracy charge.  She found that there was no evidence that
    the respondent ever agreed to be part of the human smuggling conspiracy, and
    that the only evidence was that he agreed to transport people within Vermont. 
    She therefore concluded that there was no evidence upon which a conviction for
    conspiracy could be based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found insufficient evidence in the Record of the Case to warrant
    the respondent’s committal for extradition on either charge, the extradition
    judge discharged him.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        ANALYSIS </span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) The Section 117(1) Charge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We cannot agree with the extradition judge that the Record of the Case
    contains no evidence that the respondent actually assisted foreign nationals to
    cross the border and enter the country unlawfully.  The pertinent parts of the
    Record of the Case are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The government’s evidence will show an agreement
    among …Sang Hoon Lee, Jun Park, and other named and unnamed co-conspirators to
    commit the crimes of smuggling and transporting illegal aliens for private
    financial gain.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The operation involved transporting aliens and
    recruiting others – including Sang Hoon Lee and Jun Park – to transport aliens
    from Toronto Airport to “safe houses” located in Canada where the persons would
    stay for a limited period of time while awaiting instructions to be smuggled
    into the United States.  The defendants … Sang Hoon Lee and Jun Park …further
    arranged for drivers to transport the illegal aliens from the “safe houses” to an
    area along the border of Canada and the United States, and for guides to direct
    the illegal aliens on how to cross the Canada-United States border without
    detection or apprehension. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Ko identified
    Sang Hoon Lee, Sang Hyun Lee, and Kitae Park as people who acted as drivers for
    the Jangs.  He further stated that Sang Hoon Lee also acted as a guide for the
    Jang smuggling organization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As summarized in the Record of the Case, the evidence on this issue is
    that part of the human smuggling operation was to provide guides to direct the
    illegal aliens on how to cross the Canada-United States border without
    detection or apprehension.  As well, Sang Soo Ko, a co-defendant who worked in
    the operation, identified the respondent as someone who was not only a driver
    for the operation, but who also acted as a guide for it.  This is sufficient
    evidence to support the reasonable conclusion that, as part of the smuggling
    operation, the respondent assisted illegal aliens to cross the border without
    detection or apprehension.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conclusion of the extradition judge that there was no evidence upon
    which the respondent could reasonably be found guilty of an offence under s.
    117(1) of the <i>IRPA</i> is therefore in error.  There was sufficient evidence
    to commit the respondent for extradition on this charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of this conclusion, we need not address the argument that the
    extradition judge erred in applying the reasoning of <i>R. v. Bell</i>.<i> </i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) The conspiracy charge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also disagree with the extradition judge’s view that there is no
    evidence that the respondent agreed to be part of the human smuggling
    conspiracy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to remember that pursuant to s. 33(1) of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18, the Record of the Case must contain “a document
    summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner for use in the
    prosecution”.  Section 32(1) makes the contents of that document admissible as
    evidence in an extradition hearing if the Record of the Case is certified.  The
    certification provided by a representative of the requesting state raises a
    rebuttable presumption that the evidence so summarized meets the requisite
    threshold of reliability for admission: see <i>United States of America v.
    Ferras</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 77.  As this court said in <i>United States of
    America v. McDowell</i> (2004), 183 C.C.C. (3d) 149, these legislative
    provisions are concerned with substance rather than form.  They strike a
    balance between the liberty interests of the person sought and the
    international principle of comity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here the Record of the Case prepared by the requesting state contains a
    summary of the government’s evidence that is certified to be available for
    trial and sufficient under the laws of the United States to justify
    prosecution.  That summary describes evidence of an agreement between the
    respondent and others to commit the crimes of smuggling and transporting
    illegal aliens for private financial gain.  The operation is described as
    involving the respondent and others who arranged for the transporting of aliens
    from Toronto to the United States border and providing guides to direct these
    illegal aliens on how to cross the border without detection.  The substance of
    this evidence is clear, even though the Record of the Case does not name a
    particular witness who will give it.  There is no doubt about the content of
    the evidence that is certified to be available for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence so summarized is admissible before the extradition judge
    pursuant to s. 32(1) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  It is presumptively
    reliable pursuant to the certification process, and the respondent raises no
    reliability challenge to the evidence based on the absence of a named witness
    who will give it, or for any other reason.  We are of the view that it is
    sufficient to support a committal order on the conspiracy charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We therefore conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the
    committal for extradition on both charges.  We would allow the appeal and order
    that the respondent be committed for extradition.</p>
