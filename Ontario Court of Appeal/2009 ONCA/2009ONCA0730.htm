  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions for aggravated assault, criminal
    negligence causing bodily harm and failure to provide the necessities of life. 
    He also seeks leave to appeal the global sentence imposed – 12 years
    imprisonment (8 years and 9 months imprisonment after credit for pre-trial
    custody and restrictive bail conditions).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The background facts are horrific.  The charges arose out of the brutal
    and sustained physical abuse by the appellant of his two and one-half-month old
    infant son.  As a result of the horrendous abuse inflicted on the appellant’s
    son, he has been permanently and gravely injured.  He has been left in a state
    of permanent paralysis and suffers from blindness, complete cognitive stagnation
    and constant discomfort.  He will never live a normal life and will require
    constant care.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s wife – Treena Edwards – was charged with the same
    offences as was the appellant, plus one count of breach of probation.  Her
    trial on these charges is now underway.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify at trial.  Nor did he adduce any evidence
    to contradict or challenge the Crown’s expert medical evidence.  </p>
  <h2>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises numerous grounds of appeal concerning trial
    fairness, the trial judge’s jury charge, the trial judge’s treatment of the
    opinion evidence of the Crown’s expert on child abuse, and the admission of
    evidence concerning certain statements made by the appellant to the police
    prior to and after his arrest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, it is unnecessary to address the appellant’s grounds of
    appeal in any detail.  We conclude that the conviction appeal must be dismissed
    for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, we are not persuaded that trial fairness was compromised in the
    ways alleged by the appellant.  Many of the procedural matters said by the
    appellant to have resulted in trial unfairness were the result of trial conduct
    decisions by defence counsel (<i>e.g.</i> the appellant’s decision not to
    pursue his request to re-elect a trial by judge alone after his wife decided to
    plead guilty to some of the charges against her).  In other instances, the
    matters complained of were legally permissible (<i>e.g.</i> the Crown’s initial
    decision to charge the appellant and his wife separately and, thereafter, to proceed
    against both accused jointly).    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core of the appellant’s complaint on this ground seems to be that he
    did not have the opportunity to cross-examine his wife at a preliminary inquiry
    prior to his trial and that he received late disclosure of the statement of
    facts agreed-on by the Crown and Ms. Edwards.  But the appellant had no
    absolute right to hear the evidence of his wife at a preliminary inquiry.  As
    well, he was provided with a copy of Ms. Edwards’ agreed statement of facts
    with the Crown before his own trial began.  Although he now submits that this
    disclosure was late, he brought no application before the trial judge for an
    adjournment of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, we see no error in the trial judge’s jury charge or in her
    treatment of the Crown’s expert evidence.  With respect to the latter issue,
    the appellant accepted the relevant witness’ medical expertise and
    qualifications at trial and failed to object to that part of the expert
    testimony now impugned.  Indeed, the evidence attacked by the appellant was
    given in response to cross-examination of the witness by the appellant at
    trial.  It was open to the appellant to object to the testimony at issue.  He
    failed to do so.  Moreover, he raised no objection to the trial judge’s jury
    instruction concerning the evidence of the Crown’s expert.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the Crown’s case against the appellant was overwhelming.  The
    appellant admitted to the police that he shook his son on several occasions and
    that he witnessed his wife physically assault his son on at least one occasion
    without intervening.  Thus, the appellant conceded that he was a party to the
    abuse of his son allegedly inflicted by Ms. Edwards.  But there is more.  The
    appellant also admitted to the police that he was with his son at the time
    when, according to the expert evidence at trial, the acute injury to his son’s
    brain and head was inflicted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <i>voir dire</i> was held concerning the admission at trial of the
    evidence of these damning admissions by the appellant.  We see no basis to
    interfere with the trial judge’s ruling that the admissions were voluntary and,
    hence, admissible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We therefore agree with the Crown that the appellant’s own version of
    events, together with the Crown’s uncontested medical evidence, provided a firm
    evidential foundation on which the jury could return guilty verdicts against
    the appellant on the offences charged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <h2>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn now to the appellant’s sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his sentence appeal, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by failing, after the jury returned guilty verdicts against him on
    all three counts, to try the issue of the relative degrees of participation of
    the appellant and his wife in the aggravated assault of their son.  In our
    opinion, the trial judge did not err in declining to conduct this inquiry in
    the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was entitled to make findings of fact based on the
    evidence at trial.  That evidence included, as we have said, an admission by
    the appellant that he was with his son when the infant suffered a critical head
    injury on the day that he was admitted to the hospital.  It also included expert
    medical evidence that the injury in question occurred within 12 hours of the
    infant’s arrival at the hospital.  Moreover, the appellant elected to testify
    at his sentencing hearing.  The trial judge, for cogent reasons, rejected the
    appellant’s claim that his wife had inflicted the major head injury at issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, in our view, the sentence imposed was fit having regard to
    the appellant’s egregious breach of trust, the seriousness and prolonged nature
    of the injuries inflicted and the devastating impact of those injuries on this
    young child.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave to appeal sentence is therefore granted and the sentence appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
