  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In separate proceedings, this court released both Adolf Horvath and
    Adnan Mirza on recognizances with sureties pending proceedings in this court.  In
    these proceedings, Adolf Horvath and Adnan Mirza were each challenging their
    extradition from Canada.  Horvath was also released on a subsequent
    recognizance with sureties pending his leave application to the Supreme Court
    of Canada, after his appeal was dismissed by this court.  In Horvath’s case, his
    wife, Erika Horvath, and his friend, Vilmos Balint, had agreed to be sureties
    in the amount of $60,000 each, for a total recognizance of $120,000.  In
    Mirza’s case, his parents Farida and Amir had agreed to be sureties in the
    amount of $500,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither of the accused surrendered in accordance with the terms of their recognizances.  The Minister of Justice now seeks orders that the recognizances entered into by the sureties be forfeited in full, pursuant to s. 771 of the  <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The respondents argue that they should not be required to forfeit any portion of their recognizances, or alternatively that they should not be required to forfeit the full amount of the recognizances.  While this matter was under reserve, Mr. Horvath was apprehended by the police. I will deal with this development later in the reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On these applications, the Minister of Justice, supported by the Public
    Prosecution Service of Canada and the Ministry of the Attorney General of
    Ontario (the “Crown intervenors”), asks this court to adopt an approach in
    which, absent exceptional circumstances, the entire recognizance will be
    forfeited by the surety, if the appellant fails to surrender in accordance with
    the recognizance.  The applicant and Crown intervenors submit that the court
    should recognize only a very narrow set of circumstances that would justify
    anything less than full forfeiture.  The sureties, supported by the Criminal
    Lawyers’ Association, submit that the court should continue to apply a more
    discretionary approach that allows the court to take into account a variety of
    factors when making a forfeiture order, to ensure that justice is done. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the most contentious issues dividing the two sides is whether the
    court should take into account the fact that the surety has exercised due
    diligence in ensuring the accused complied with the terms of the recognizance. 
    The applicant and the Crown intervenors submit that the surety’s due diligence
    is an irrelevant consideration.  The sureties and the Criminal Lawyers’
    Association favour a fault-based system where the diligence of the surety is of
    paramount importance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not entirely adopt the position advocated by any of the
    parties.  I generally agree with the position of the sureties that the court
    has a broad discretion in determining whether and how much of the recognizance
    should be forfeited.  However, in my view, the surety’s due diligence is merely
    one factor to take into account and in many cases will have no impact on the
    decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these cases, I would grant the applications in part.  I would order
    that Erika Horvath forfeit the entire sum of $60,000 and that Vilmos Balint
    forfeit the sum of $20,000.  I would order that the Mirzas forfeit the sum of
    $180,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.  Adolf Horvath</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adolf Horvath and his wife Erika are of Roma heritage.  In 1999, along
    with their son, Adam, they fled Hungary to avoid persecution in that country.  In
    2002, Mrs. Horvath and Adam’s claims for refugee status were accepted.  Mr.
    Horvath was found ineligible to advance a refugee claim.  On November 12, 2003,
    the Minister of Justice issued an Authority to Proceed against Mr. Horvath at
    the request of the Republic of Hungary on charges of robbery, extortion and
    uttering threats.  The Superior Court of Justice ordered that Mr. Horvath be released
    on a recognizance in the amount of $120,000 with two sureties, Mrs. Horvath and
    his close friend Vilmos Balint, each agreeing to be surety in the amount of
    $60,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2005, Mr. Horvath was ordered committed to await surrender.  He
    immediately appealed to this court from that order and, on June 17, 2005,
    Goudge J.A. ordered his release on a recognizance on almost the same terms as
    the release order in the Superior Court.  In May 2006, the Minister of Justice
    ordered that Mr. Horvath be surrendered to the Republic of Hungary.  He
    immediately filed a notice of application for judicial review of the Minister's
    decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is customary in this court, the bail order made by Goudge J.A.
    contained a sunset clause requiring that Mr. Horvath surrender into custody either
    by a certain date or the day before his appeal was heard, whichever was
    earlier.  New release orders were made by judges of this court from time to
    time pending the hearing of the appeal and the application for judicial
    review.  Mr. Horvath complied with all the terms of those orders and, in
    particular, he surrendered into custody on October 3, 2007, the day before the
    appeal and application were heard.  When the appeal and the application for
    judicial review were dismissed, on October 24, 2007, Mr. Horvath applied for
    leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  On November 2, 2007, Rouleau
    J.A. granted Mr. Horvath judicial interim release pending his application for
    leave to appeal.  It was a term of that order that he surrender into custody
    within 48 hours of being informed that the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision
    on the leave application was ready for release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Horvath did not surrender as required and, on March 20, 2008,
    Moldaver J.A. issued an order for his arrest.  On April 10, 2008, Juriansz J.A.
    ordered that the recognizance be noted for estreat.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both sureties filed affidavits in which they related the efforts they
    made to ensure that Mr. Horvath complied with the terms of the recognizance and
    surrendered into custody as required.  Mr. Balint had been a surety for Mr.
    Horvath since 2003.  During the ensuing 5 years, he had stayed in regular
    contact with Mr. Horvath and reminded him of his court dates.  Mr. Horvath was
    required to surrender into custody on five occasions during this time, in
    accordance with the bail orders of this court, and did so.  On March 18, 2008, Mr.
    Balint, Mr. Horvath and Mrs. Horvath met with a member of Mr.&nbsp;Horvath’s
    lawyer’s law firm.  They were informed at that time that the Supreme Court was
    ready to release its decision and that Mr. Horvath was therefore required to
    surrender into custody.  Mr. Balint last saw Mr. Horvath on March 19, 2008, shortly
    before Mr. Horvath left with Mrs. Horvath who was taking him to the jail.  Mr. Balint
    saw nothing in Mr. Balint’s behaviour that made him think that he was not going
    to surrender.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following day, Mr. Balint received a telephone call from Mrs.
    Horvath saying that Mr. Horvath had in fact not surrendered into custody.  Mr.
    Balint attempted to find Mr. Horvath.  He contacted Mr. Horvath’s lawyer and
    the police.  On March 25, 2008, Mr. Horvath telephoned Mr. Balint, but would
    not say where he was.  Mr. Balint tried to persuade Mr. Horvath to surrender,
    and believed by the end of the conversation that he had been successful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a second affidavit, Mr. Balint set out his financial circumstances. 
    I will return to that affidavit later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Horvath also swore an affidavit.  She says that she too was
    diligent in ensuring that her husband complied with the bail terms.  She
    confirms that she drove him the jail on March 19, 2008.  However, she did not actually
    watch him go into the jail because she found it too painful to do so.  As on
    the prior occasions, Mr. Horvath gave his wallet and cell phone to Mrs. Horvath. 
    Mrs. Horvath has not taken any steps to assist the authorities in finding her
    husband.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.  Adnan Mirza</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adnan Mirza [“Adnan”] was arrested for fraud-related charges in April
    2005 at the request of the United States of America.  The amount of the alleged
    fraud was approximately $500,000.  On April 28, 2005, a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice ordered that Adnan be released on a recognizance with his
    parents, Farida and Amir Mirza (together, the “Mirzas”), acting as sureties.  The
    amount of the recognizance was $500,000, even though Farida testified that they
    only had $120,000 of equity in their home and there was no indication that they
    had any other significant assets.  The transcript of that bail hearing suggests
    that the judge was very reluctant to release Adnan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the bail hearing, Adnan was facing a fraud charge in
    Canada and he had previously skipped bail in the United States.  His parents
    had posted a bond for him on the earlier United States charge and had forfeited
    that sum.  The materials suggest that the bond was in the amount of $20,000.  They
    were also sureties for Adnan on the outstanding fraud charge in Canada.  Adnan
    pled guilty to that charge in 2006 and was given a conditional sentence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 3, 2006, Adnan was committed to await surrender.  He
    immediately appealed that decision.  Blair J.A. made an order releasing the
    accused pending the appeal on almost the same terms as had been made by the
    Superior Court of Justice.  The Mirzas were again sureties in the amount of
    $500,000.  In their affidavits in support of the bail application, the Mirzas
    represented that they had approximately $290,000 in equity in their home.  They
    did not disclose that they had put a second mortgage on the property in January
    2006 that reduced the equity in the house to just over $200,000.  On August 1,
    2006, the Minister of Justice ordered that Adnan be surrendered to the United
    States.  Adnan immediately filed an application for judicial review of the
    Minister’s decision.  Later that year, Adnan abandoned the appeal from
    committal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in the Horvath case, it was a term of this court’s release order that
    the accused surrender into custody on the earlier of the day before the hearing
    of the appeal or the specified sunset date.  New orders were made on several
    occasions as the sunset dates were about to arrive.  The application for
    judicial review was scheduled to be heard on May 25, 2007.  Adnan did not
    surrender as required on May 24, and the application for judicial review was
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mirzas have filed affidavits in which they set out the efforts they
    made to ensure that Adnan complied with the terms of his recognizance.  Farida
    moved in with Adnan, and Amir said that he was in regular contact with him.  Farida
    says that she kept in contact with her son throughout the day while he was at
    work.  According to Farida, the relationship between Adnan and his wife began
    to deteriorate.  On March 1, 2007, Adnan and his family moved out of their rental
    home.  Adnan’s wife and the children moved into another residence and Adnan moved
    in with the Mirzas.  It was a term of the recognizance that Adnan and his
    sureties notify the police and the court of any change of residence.  The Mirzas
    claim that Adnan told them he had done so.  In fact he had not. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As they had on prior occasions, the Mirzas intended to drive the accused
    to the jail on May 24, 2007.  According to Farida, on the morning of May 24 Adnan
    left the house around 8:00 a.m., saying that he was going to his lawyer’s
    office to pay a bill.  Adnan had borrowed a car from a friend for that
    purpose.  At around 9:30 a.m., Farida began to panic because she had not heard
    from Adnan, and she tried to contact him.  She learned from Adnan’s wife that
    Don, a friend of Adnan’s, was trying to contact Farida because he had lent Adnan
    a car and some money was now unable to locate him.  At around 1:00 p.m., Farida
    went to the office of the justice of the peace and applied to be relieved of
    her obligation as a surety.  Amir attended at the court office the next day for
    the same purpose.  Neither Farida nor Amir did anything to assist the police in
    locating their son, and he remains at large.  On June 8, 2007, Armstrong J.A.
    ordered that Adnan’s recognizance be noted for estreat.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their affidavits, the Mirzas discuss their current financial
    circumstances.  I will return to that evidence later in these reasons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III. The Proceedings in this Court</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister of Justice applied to forfeit the recognizance that had been
    noted for estreat.  The applications were originally heard by separate judges
    of this court.  The Mirza application was heard by Simmons J.A.  The Horvath
    application was heard by Borins J.A.  The court decided to rehear both
    applications before a five-person panel, particularly because of the suggestion
    that an earlier decision of this court in <i>R. v. Huang</i> (1998), 127 C.C.C.
    (3d) 397, ought to be reconsidered.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provisions respecting forfeiture of recognizances are set out in
    Part XXV of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  In summary, where an accused does not
    comply with a condition of a recognizance, s. 770 provides that a judge shall make
    an endorsement on the recognizance setting out the nature of the default, the
    reasons for the default (if known), “whether the ends of justice have been
    defeated or delayed by reason of the default” and the names and addresses of
    the accused (the principal) and the sureties.  The Crown may then apply to the
    court under s. 771(1)(a) to fix a date for the hearing of an application for
    the forfeiture of the recognizance.  This hearing, commonly referred to as an
    estreat hearing, is ordinarily conducted by a judge of the superior trial court
    of the province.  However, in Quebec, the estreat hearing is held before a
    judge of the Court of Quebec, and in British Columbia the estreat hearing is
    held before a judge of the Provincial Court in respect of a recognizance for
    the appearance of the accused in that court.  Uniquely, in Ontario, where the
    bail order is made by this court, the estreat hearing is conducted by a judge
    of this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next step in the procedure, contained in s. 771(1)(b), is for the
    clerk of the court to notify the accused and the sureties of the hearing to
    permit them to “show cause why the recognizance should not be forfeited.”  The hearing
    itself is governed by s. 771(2), which provides that after giving the parties
    an opportunity to be heard, the judge “may … in his discretion grant or refuse
    the application and make any order with respect to the forfeiture of the
    recognizance that he considers proper.”  Where a forfeiture order is made, s.
    771(3) provides that the accused and the sureties become judgment debtors of
    the Crown “each in the amount that the judge orders him to pay.”  The order may
    then be filed in the superior court and the clerk of that court shall issue a
    writ of <i>fieri facias</i>.  The sheriff will then execute the writ: s. 772.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 773, where the writ has been issued but the sheriff has not
    been able to seize sufficient real or personal property to satisfy the writ,
    the Crown may apply to a judge to fix a time and place for the sureties “to
    show cause why a warrant of committal should not be issued in respect of them.” 
    The judge hearing the application for committal “may in his discretion” order
    the discharge of the amount for which the surety is liable or order that the
    surety be committed to prison, where the surety may remain “until satisfaction
    is made or until the period of imprisonment fixed by the judge has expired.” 
    At the hearing, we were told by counsel that there is no reported case of any
    surety having been imprisoned in Ontario in over 100 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no right of appeal in the <i>Criminal Code</i> from the
    decisions made under ss.&nbsp;771 and 773.  As well, except in the limited
    circumstances where the estreat hearing is held before a provincial court
    judge, judicial review by way of <i>certiorari</i> would not be available.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.  The Onus of Proof</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was some discussion at the hearing of these applications as to who
    bore the onus of proof on a forfeiture hearing.  In my view, the onus is on the
    surety to show why the recognizance should not be forfeited.  This follows from
    the wording of s. 771(1)(b) which gives the surety the opportunity “to show
    cause why the recognizance should not be forfeited.”  This language is similar
    to the language in the judicial interim release provisions in Part XVI of the <i>Code</i>. 
    The party required to “show cause” under those provisions has been held to have
    the burden of proof.  Finally, Mr. Justice Gary Trotter, in the leading text on
    bail, <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1999) (“<i>Trotter</i>”),
    notes at p. 473 that placing the onus of proof on the surety is also consistent
    with the wording of the recognizance itself.  The recognizance, Form 32,
    records in somewhat archaic language that the sureties “acknowledged themselves
    to owe to Her Majesty the Queen the several amounts set opposite their
    respective names”.  It makes sense that the sureties, having acknowledged their
    debt, ought to have the onus of showing why that debt should be discharged. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.  The Test to be Applied</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The Case Law</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A case that has been the source of considerable debate respecting the
    test on an application for forfeiture of a recognizance is <i>R. v. Southampton
    Justices, ex parte Green</i>, [1975] 2 All E.R. 1073 (C.A.).  The English
    legislation dealt with in that case is similar to s. 771 in providing that the
    court “may … adjudge [the surety] to pay part only of the sum or remit the sum.” 
    In <i>ex parte Green</i>, Lord Denning held at p. 1077 that the word “may”
    confers a discretion and enables the court “to do what the justice of the case
    requires.”  Then in a paragraph that has been frequently criticized in
    subsequent cases, he set out his view as to the guiding principles to be
    referred to in determining the sum to be forfeited by the surety at pp. 1077-78:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By what principles are the justices to be guided?
    They ought, I think, to consider to what extent the surety was at fault. If he
    or she connived at the disappearance of the accused man, or aided it or abetted
    it, it would be proper to forfeit the whole of the sum. If he or she was
    wanting in due diligence to secure his appearance, it might be proper to
    forfeit the whole or a substantial part of it, depending on the degree of
    fault. If he or she was guilty of no want of diligence and used every effort to
    secure the appearance of the accused man, it might be proper to remit it
    entirely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Denning allowed the surety’s application for <i>certiorari</i> and
    set aside the order of the justices forfeiting the full amount of her
    recognizance because the justices had failed to take into account the surety’s
    “culpability”: p. 1079.  In his concurring reasons, Browne L.J. agreed with
    Lord Denning that the justices erred in “that they did not enquire into the
    circumstances of Mr Green’s disappearance nor the extent to which Mrs Green was
    to blame for it.”  In his view, that was “something which they ought to have
    considered in exercising their discretion”: p. 1079.  Brightman J. agreed with
    Lord Denning and Browne L.J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The approach in <i>ex parte Green</i> has been followed in Ontario.  In
    particular, in <i>Huang</i>, McMurtry C.J.O. quoted with approval the passage
    set out above.  In that case, the recognizance was in the amount of $200,000. 
    McMurtry C.J.O. was of the view that the surety, who lived in a different city
    than the appellant, had not exercised due diligence in supervising the
    appellant and had acted in bad faith in placing a large mortgage on his
    property after entering into the recognizance, “thereby effectively wiping out
    his equity”: para. 10.  However, McMurtry C.J.O. was also critical of the
    police for failing to inform the surety that the appellant had failed to report
    to the reporting centre.  He ordered that the amount of $75,000 be forfeited by
    the surety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Ex parte Green</i> has also been followed in other provinces.  See,
    for example:  <i>R. v. Andrews</i> (1975), 9 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 168 (Nfld.
    S.C.); <i>R. v. Miller</i>, [1990] B.C.J. No. 2016 (Co. Ct.); <i>R. v. Sandhu</i> (1984), 38 C.R. (3d) 56 (Que. S.C.); and <i>R. v. Millward</i> (1998), 128
    C.C.C. (3d) 67 (Alta. Q.B.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On these applications, the Minister of Justice Canada and the Crown
    intervenors submit that the <i>ex parte Green</i> approach is wrong.  They
    submit that this fault-based test does not adequately ensure respect for and
    compliance with surety bails.  The criticism of this approach is captured in
    this comment by Justice Trotter in his text at p. 481:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An approach based on the fault or diligence of the
    surety neglects the effect this might have on the accused person.  An accused
    with diligent and responsible sureties could abscond at the last minute,
    knowing that his/her sureties (perhaps family members or other close relations)
    will be relieved from forfeiture by having done their best.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister also submits that since <i>ex parte Green</i>, the courts
    in England have distanced themselves from a fault-based approach.  It is
    unnecessary to review all of the cases since <i>ex parte Green.</i>  One of the
    clearest expressions of the approach now taken in England is found in <i>R. v.
    Crown Court at Maidstone, ex parte Lever</i>, [1995] 2 All E.R. 35 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is pointed out in <i>ex parte Lever</i>, much of the concern in the
    English cases since <i>ex parte Green</i> has been with the following sentence
    from Lord Denning’s reasons in that case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If he or she was guilty of no want of diligence and
    used every effort to secure the appearance of the accused man, it might be
    proper to remit it entirely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Ex parte Lever</i> and other English cases establish that it is only
    in exceptional circumstances that the entire amount of the recognizance would
    be forgiven.  As Butler-Sloss L.J. said, at p. 38, “Lord Denning MR was
    considering a wholly extreme and exceptional case” in which it would be proper
    to remit the recognizance entirely.  The kind of circumstances that might lead
    to forgiveness of the entire amount are explained in a case such as <i>R. v.
    Harrow Crown Court, ex parte Lingard</i>, [1998] E.W.H.C 233 “where the surety
    is entirely blameless and the failure of the defendant to surrender to bail is
    wholly outside the control of, and unforeseeable by, the surety.”  To a similar
    effect is <i>R. v. Crown Court at Reading, ex parte Bello</i> (1990), 92 Cr.
    App. R. 303 (C.A.), at p. 311, giving as an example a case where the accused
    and the surety were on the way to court when both were seriously injured in a
    motor vehicle accident</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, despite this hesitance to forgive entirely a recognizance
    entered into by a surety, the English cases confirm that the statutory
    provisions confer a broad discretion on the justices and that the surety’s
    diligence is a relevant consideration when determining the amount of forfeiture. 
    Butler-Sloss L.J. put it this way in <i>ex parte Lever, </i>at p. 38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The presence or absence of culpability is a factor
    but the absence of culpability, as found in this case by the judge, is not in
    itself a reason to reduce or set aside the obligation entered into by the
    surety to pay in the event of a failure to bring the defendant to court.  The
    court may, in the exercise of a wide discretion, decide it would be fair and
    just to estreat some or all of the recognisance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To a similar effect are the reasons of Hoffman LJ, also in <i>ex parte
    Lever,</i> at p. 41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court has a broad discretion to remit the
    forfeiture of all or part, but the burden is upon the surety to satisfy the
    court that this is what the justice of the case requires.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In considering the justice of the case, the lack of
    culpability of the surety and the negligence of the police were matters to be
    taken into account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This same approach has been adopted in other countries.  For example, in <i>Baytieh v. State of Queensland, </i>[1999] Q.C.A 466, at para. 12, the
    Queensland Court of Appeal held that it will only be in rare circumstances that
    the entire amount of the recognizance would be forgiven, “given the importance
    of ensuring the integrity of the surety system”.  But, the court agreed that
    the surety’s degree of fault was a relevant consideration: para.&nbsp;13. 
    Other considerations that the court found to be relevant included financial
    hardship experienced after the recognizance was entered into and the reasonableness
    of the surety’s expectation that the accused would comply with the bail
    conditions.  The court otherwise considered that it would be unwise “to attempt
    a definitive statement of the considerations which may be relevant to this
    question”: para. 15.  To a similar effect are decisions from New Zealand (<i>R.
    v. Hopewell, in re Langford</i>, [1958] N.Z.L.R. 523) and from the State of
    Victoria (<i>Re Condon</i>, [1973] V.R. 427; <i>Mokbel v. D.P.P. (Vic) and
    D.P.P. (C’th) </i>(2006)<i>, </i>14 V.R. 405).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel also referred us to a number of authorities from the United
    States that have dealt with the forfeiture issues. However, I did not find
    these authorities of assistance given the very different bail system in that
    country.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The “Pull of Bail”</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this case, the most important point that comes from the
    English cases is what is referred to as the “pull of bail”.  In <i>ex parte
    Lever</i>, at pp. 38 &amp; 41, Butler-Sloss and Hoffman L.J.J. referred with approval
    to the following statement from Lord Widgery C.J. in <i>R. v. Southampton
    Justices, ex parte Corker</i> (1976), 120 S.J. 214, as quoted from the full
    transcript contained in <i>R. v. Uxbridge Justices, ex parte Heward-Mills</i>,
    [1983] 1 All E.R. 530, at p. 532<i> </i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The real pull of bail, the real effective force
    that it exerts, is that it may cause the offender to attend his trial rather
    than subject his nearest and dearest who has gone surety for him to undue pain
    and discomfort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the “pull of bail” is an important factor that serves as a
    reminder that, in attempting to do what is just and fair towards the sureties,
    the courts must be careful not to undermine the effectiveness of the bail
    system.  Our system depends upon accused attending court and if accused came to
    believe that they could fail to attend court without their sureties suffering
    any penalty, the surety system would be ineffective.  As Justice Trotter notes,
    at p. 461 of his text, the effect of potential forfeiture “would be seriously
    diluted by widespread knowledge that the procedure is only invoked
    sporadically.”  An overemphasis on the surety’s lack of fault could undermine
    the “pull of bail” and have an adverse impact on the criminal justice system,
    which depends upon the accused complying with release conditions.  The
    applicant submits that, in order to avoid such a result, the degree of fault
    attributable to a surety for an accused who has breached the terms of the
    recognizance should not play a role in determining the amount of the recognizance
    that should be forfeited. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts in Canada that have adopted a broad discretionary approach have
    referred to a number of factors in considering whether to relieve against
    forfeiture.  The reasons of Durno J. in <i>R. v. Nguyen</i>, [2007] O.J. No.
    5321, at para. 12, contain a list of the factors courts have taken into account
    on forfeiture applications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering what the appropriate test on a forfeiture application is,
    I recognize the preeminent importance of preserving the “moral pressure” (<i>Trotter</i> at p. 460) or “pull of bail”, so as to ensure that the accused complies with
    the bail conditions, especially the condition that the accused appear in court
    or surrender into custody as required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, despite the importance of the “pull of bail”, I do not agree
    with the Minister and the Crown intervenors that the only way to ensure the
    effectiveness of the system is to adopt a rigid rule of total forfeiture absent
    exceptional circumstances.  Such an approach is inconsistent with the broad
    discretion implied by the words of s.&nbsp;771(2): “may … <i>in his discretion</i> grant or refuse the application and <i>make any order</i> with respect to the
    forfeiture of the recognizance <i>that he considers proper</i>” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pull of bail can sometimes be vindicated by something less than total
    forfeiture.  The Mirza case which involves a substantial sum, is an obvious
    example.  It is not necessary to order forfeiture of the entire $500,000, an
    amount the Mirzas cannot possibly pay, to ensure the effectiveness of the bail
    system.  Ordering forfeiture of a substantial sum that would entirely wipe out
    any equity that they have in their home would surely be more than sufficient.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, in the vast majority of cases, which involve
    relatively small sums, probably nothing less than total forfeiture would
    suffice to vindicate the pull of bail.  Statistics gathered by the Public
    Prosecution Service seem to support this approach.  Those statistics show that
    in a period of just over a year there was total forfeiture in approximately 93
    percent of all surety bails for which the Crown sought forfeiture.  Most of
    these recognizances were in amounts of $5,000 or less.  The statistics do not
    reveal whether the sureties attended the forfeiture hearings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three further concerns also lead to the conclusion that the diligence of
    a surety is a relevant consideration in forfeiture hearings.  First, the right
    to reasonable bail is a constitutional guarantee, and as sureties have become
    an integral part of the bail system and an important means of ensuring that
    constitutional imperative (see <i>Trotter</i> at pp. 277, 283-84; <i>R. v.
    Dodson</i> (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 134 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 43), we should
    avoid an approach that would unduly discourage sureties from coming forward.  There
    may now be an over reliance on sureties.  Thus, see the comments of Professor
    Friedland in “Criminal Justice in Canada Revisited” (2004), 48 C.L.Q. 419 at
    433-34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The present system is, however, not
    working well in Ontario.  The pendulum has swung too far in the direction of
    requiring sureties rather than using release on one’s own recognizance.  In
    England, sureties are required in only a small fraction of the cases.  About
    two thirds of those who appear for a bail hearing in Toronto today are required
    to find sureties and only about half of this number are actually released.  The
    other half, it appears, could not find acceptable sureties.  Less than 10% held
    for a bail hearing are released on their own undertaking or recognizance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            What appears to be happening is that
    the requirement to find sureties has taken the place of cash bail as a method
    of holding accused persons in custody.  The majority of persons who are caught
    up in the criminal justice system, many of whom are not from the community
    where they are arrested, have difficulty finding sureties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, without sureties more accused could be detained
    pending trial or appeal:  <i>Millward</i> at para. 26.  The court must not be
    so inflexible in their exercise of discretion that responsible sureties are discouraged
    from coming forward.  That could well be the case if the surety’s due diligence
    were considered to be irrelevant.  In other words, the focus on the forfeiture
    application cannot be solely on the impact of forfeiture on the accused. 
    Sureties are expected to supervise the accused; it is unreasonable and unfair
    to completely ignore their efforts on a forfeiture hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, while forfeiture proceedings have some similarity to civil
    proceedings, the proceedings are part of the criminal justice system and the
    court cannot lose sight of the fact that the ultimate enforcement procedure,
    even if seldom invoked, is imprisonment.  It would be unjust to ignore the
    degree of fault attributable to a surety when there is a possibility that they
    could be imprisoned.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, sureties rarely receive independent legal advice, as they would
    when entering into similar obligations in a civil context.  The sureties may
    have a very limited understanding of the extent of their obligations.  Principles
    relating to enforcement of guarantees in the civil context are of limited
    assistance in understanding how the forfeiture process should operate in the
    criminal context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the diligence of the surety is only one factor relevant
    to a forfeiture hearing.  In the end, the judge must attempt to balance various
    considerations in exercising the discretion conferred by s. 771(2).  I do not
    think it is helpful or even possible to develop an exhaustive list of the
    factors that the judge should take into account in exercising this discretion. 
    Further, not all factors will be of equal relevancy or weight in all cases.  A
    review of the cases does, however, show that there are categories of factors
    that the courts regularly take into account, including: the amount of the
    recognizance; the circumstances under which the surety entered into the
    recognizance, especially whether there was any duress or coercion; the surety’s
    diligence; the surety’s means; any significant change in the surety’s financial
    position after the recognizance was entered into and especially after the
    breach; the surety’s post-breach conduct, especially attempts to assist the
    authorities in locating the accused; and the relationship between the accused
    and the surety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the particular applications at issue in this matter, I
    would make three remarks relevant to forfeiture proceedings generally.  As
    noted above, the onus is on the surety to show why full forfeiture of the
    recognizance should not be ordered.  The circumstances relevant to the exercise
    of the court’s discretion to relieve against full forfeiture are largely within
    the knowledge of the surety.  Sureties asserting that they should be relieved
    from forfeiture of any amount of the recognizance have the obligation to adduce
    credible evidence to support their position.  The courts should also take into
    account that the Crown will often not be in a position to adduce evidence to
    refute those claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, when hearing forfeiture applications, courts should remember
    that a bail order is a court order, and it is not open to the surety to mount a
    collateral attack on the appropriateness of that order.  There was some hint of
    this approach in the Mirza case, the suggestion being that the $500,000 surety
    was out of proportion to the nature of the fraud and was excessive.  There were
    procedures in place that Adnan or his sureties could have utilized if they considered
    the order to be inappropriate.  Adnan could have sought review of the order.  Additionally,
    of course, the Mirzas were not required to enter into the recognizance, and even
    after having done so they could have applied to be relieved as sureties in
    accordance with ss. 766 and 767 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it appears that it is open to the court to make a conditional
    order that the recognizance be forfeited unless the accused is taken into
    custody by a certain date: see <i>Miller</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. APPLICATION</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.  Erika Horvath</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Supervision of the accused Mr. Horvath fell primarily upon his wife,
    Erika Horvath.  She lived with him and was in the best position to ensure that
    he complied with the conditions of his bail and surrendered as required.  She
    was also the only person who would be aware of any indications that he would
    not surrender.  Her conduct on the date of Mr. Horvath’s surrender is highly
    suspect.  While she claims to have driven the accused to the jail, she admits
    that she did not actually see him enter the jail and surrender.  She made no
    effort to assist the authorities in locating her husband.  As well, her
    financial situation has not worsened since she entered into the recognizance;
    in fact, her situation is somewhat better at this time.  Mrs. Horvath has not
    shown any circumstances that would justify refusing to forfeit the entire
    amount of the recognizance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, developments while this matter was under reserve further
    support forfeiture of the entire amount. The court was informed that Mr.
    Horvath had been captured and returned to custody on August 19, 2009. On that
    day, Ms. Horvath was observed leaving her residence in a vehicle. A second
    vehicle left five minutes later. The fugitive, Mr. Horvath was discovered in
    that second vehicle. The vehicle was registered to Ms. Horvath. At the time of
    his apprehension, Mr. Horvath was in possession of a fraudulent Ontario driver’s
    licence issued in May 2009 and a fraudulent Hungarian passport issued in
    December 2008. Mr. Horvath had been unlawfully at large since March. 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court invited further written submissions as to what effect, if any,
    Mr.&nbsp;Horvath’s apprehension should have on the orders to be made against
    Ms. Horvath and the other surety, Mr. Vilmos Balint.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Ms. Horvath did not submit that Mr. Horvath’s capture should
    necessarily have any impact on the order to be made against her. He submitted,
    however, that the court “may need to hear further evidence from Erika Horvath”
    before deciding whether Mr. Horvath’s apprehension should affect the order
    against Ms. Horvath.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree. As explained above, Ms. Horvath has the onus to show why
    the recognizance should not be forfeited. She has had a full opportunity to
    discharge that onus both in the initial hearing and by way of a affidavit had
    she so chosen subsequent to her husband’s apprehension. Mr. Horvath has not
    placed any further evidence before this court and it is not for the court to
    seek out further information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In keeping with an approach which favours a broad consideration of all
    relevant factors, I accept that the apprehension of the fugitive is relevant to
    the determination of what order, if any, should be made against the sureties in
    an estreatment proceeding. The effect of the impact of the fugitive’s
    apprehension will depend on the specifics surrounding that apprehension and a
    consideration of the other factors identified in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances surrounding Mr. Horvath’s apprehension strongly
    suggest that Ms. Horvath was culpably acquiescent, if not complicit, in Mr.
    Horvath’s attempt to defeat the course of justice for the year and a half that
    he was unlawfully at large. Those circumstances provide further justification
    for an order requiring that Ms. Horvath forfeit the entire amount of the
    recognizance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would order that Mrs. Horvath forfeit the entire amount of $60,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.  Vilmos Balint</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Balint exercised some supervision over Mr. Horvath but, on the day
    the accused was to surrender, he left it to Mrs. Horvath to ensure that Mr.
    Horvath surrendered.  Mr. Balint made some, although hardly robust, efforts to
    try and locate the appellant after he failed to surrender.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most significant circumstance in Mr. Balint’s case is that he
    suffered a serious business reversal after Mr. Horvath failed to surrender. 
    Most of Mr. Balint’s income comes from a company that provides commercial
    cleaning and maintenance services for residential high-rise buildings.  In June
    2008, he lost his major contract, with the result that he lost most of his
    income.  While there is equity in his home sufficient to cover the entire
    $60,000, he would have to sell his home if the entire amount was ordered forfeited
    since, given his present financial circumstances, he would not be able to
    obtain a second mortgage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Mr. Balint submits that the apprehension of Mr. Horvath
    should be a significant factor in determining what order should be made against
    Mr. Balint. He submits that the Crown usually withdraws estreatment
    applications if an accused is captured before those proceedings are completed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Balint had nothing to do with the apprehension of Mr. Horvath. Nor
    is there anything to suggest that he made any attempt to assist Mr. Horvath
    while he was unlawfully at large. The apprehension of Mr. Horvath does,
    however, make this more a case of justice delayed than justice defeated. Adding
    Mr. Horvath’s apprehension to the mix of the relevant considerations merits
    some mitigation of the forfeiture order. I would order that Mr. Balint forfeit
    $20,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.  Farida and Amir Mirza</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances on the day the accused Adnan Mirza was to surrender were
    at least unusual, and by mid-day had aroused his parents’ suspicions.  Yet, apart
    from a somewhat belated application by Farida to be relieved of her obligations
    as a surety, they did nothing to alert the authorities of their suspicions and
    failed to assist the authorities in attempting to locate the accused.  They
    also failed to exercise diligence in ensuring that the accused complied with
    the term of his recognizance requiring him to notify the court of a change of
    address.  In favour of the Mirzas is that Farida actually moved in with Adnan and
    his family so as to better supervise him, and when Adnan and his wife split up,
    Farida and Amir arranged for Adnan to live with them.  On balance, there is
    little in the conduct of the Mirzas that favours much reduction in the amount
    to be forfeited.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, that is not the end of the story.  The circumstances that led
    to Farida and Amir entering into a $500,000 recognizance are unusual and
    hopefully unique.  The $500,000 amount originated in the bail hearing in the
    Superior Court of Justice when Adnan was first arrested under the provisional
    extradition warrant.  The judge set that amount in the face of evidence that
    the Mirzas’ only substantial asset, their home, had equity of only $120,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Adnan applied for bail before this court, Farida and Amir swore
    affidavits in support of the application asserting that they had approximately
    $289,000 in equity in their home.  In doing so, they claimed that the house,
    which was purchased for $400,000 in 2004, had a market value of $650,000.  They
    said that there was a mortgage in the amount of $361,000, and failed to
    disclose that they had placed another mortgage on the home of about $85,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They now assert that the market value of their home has declined
    precipitously to $499,000.  They also assert that in June 2008 they
    consolidated the first and second mortgages for a total amount of $488,000, all
    but wiping out their equity in the home.  In short, the Mirzas have been less
    than candid in this court and have adjusted the value of their home depending
    upon their purpose.  When it suited their purpose, the house was alleged to
    have a very high value.  Now that it is not in their interest, the equity in
    the home has evaporated.  At no point have they offered any independent expert
    opinion to support the market value of their home.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this is a case where there must be a substantial
    forfeiture.  The sureties knew that there was a serious risk that Adnan would
    flee; in fact, he had already done so once in the United States.  In the
    circumstances, one would have expected them to be especially vigilant in
    ensuring that all of the conditions of the bail were satisfied, particularly on
    the date that Adnan was to surrender into custody.  Yet, they did not ensure
    that the court was notified of the change of address, and they allowed Adnan to
    leave their home early on the day he was to surrender in a car borrowed from
    someone that they barely knew.  This is the kind of case where the importance
    of preserving the “real pull of bail” is of significant importance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also find the Mirzas’ claims concerning the current value of their
    home to be incredible.  In my view, their assertions about the value of the
    home when they sought Adnan’s release in this court must carry significant
    weight.  That said, forfeiture of the entire $500,000 is unreasonable and
    unnecessary.  It is unreasonable because the Mirzas have never claimed to have
    assets anywhere near $500,000.  They also have a very limited ability to earn
    income.  There is no contest that Amir’s income as a salesman has suffered
    considerably as a result of his age and the current economic conditions.  Full
    forfeiture is unnecessary because a substantial but partial forfeiture will
    adequately ensure the integrity of the bail and surety system.  I would order
    that the Mirzas forfeit the amount of $180,000 unless the accused is taken into
    custody within 15 days of the release of this judgment. If the accused is taken
    into custody within 15 days, the sureties may apply in writing for relief from
    all or part of this order.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.  Information for Sureties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many of the counsel in this case, especially counsel for the Criminal
    Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada,
    expressed concern about the information that potential sureties are given. 
    There is information on a website maintained by the Attorney General for
    Ontario about the duties of sureties, and a pamphlet containing the same
    information is available at courthouses.  This information is helpful and is expressed
    in plain language.  It is unclear whether the pamphlet is provided to sureties
    as a matter of routine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the large amounts that may be involved, sureties rarely obtain
    independent legal advice.  The accused’s lawyer cannot give such advice because
    counsel’s interests are aligned with the client, who naturally is anxious to be
    released from custody.  It would helpful if the justice of the peace before
    whom sureties appear to enter into a recognizance were to provide the sureties
    with a simple caution that outlined in clear and concise terms the nature of
    their obligations.  The Public Prosecution Service of Canada has offered a
    sample Surety Caution that could be used for that purpose.  I have attached
    this sample form as an Appendix to these reasons. If the authorities propose
    using such a form it would, of course, have to be modified to take into account
    these reasons. I refer in particular to the paragraph describing the
    consequences of a breach.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the applications in part and order forfeiture
    of the following amounts:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Erika Horvath:          $60,000. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Vilmos Balint:          $20,000. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Farida and Amir Mirza:       $180,000, unless the
    accused is taken into custody within 15 days of the release of this judgment.
    If the accused is taken into custody within 15 days, the Mirzas may apply in
    writing for relief from all or part of this order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the court I would like to thank all counsel for their
    submissions, and especially thank counsel for the Public Prosecution Service of
    Canada and the Minister of Justice Canada who arranged to obtain statistics
    concerning bail forfeiture applications in the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
