  </table>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      This appeal arises out of two actions that
    were tried together. One action was a matrimonial proceeding between Julie
    Medeiros and Carlos Medeiros; the other action was a claim by Julie's brother,
    Robert Posa, on a promissory note given to him by Julie and Carlos.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Following a five-day trial, Snowie J. held
    that the promissory note reflects a valid debt and that Julie and Carlos owe
    Robert $220,000 plus $57,923.29 in interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Although the trial judge did not do an
    equalization calculation, the parties acknowledge that, if the trial judge's
    finding concerning the promissory note is upheld in this court, both spouses would
    have a deemed net family property of zero and neither would owe an equalization
    payment to the other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      On appeal, Carlos submits that the trial
    judge erred in finding that there is a valid debt owing to Robert and that she
    further erred in failing to make an order relating to his interest in the jointly
    owned matrimonial home.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      By way of cross-appeal, Julie submits that
    the trial judge erred in failing to determine what is to happen with the
    parties’ jointly owned assets. On behalf of herself and Robert, she asks that
    Carlos's interest in the matrimonial home be transferred to her in satisfaction
    of Carlos's debt to Robert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Further,
    in the event this court determines that the trial judge erred in finding there
    is a valid debt owing to Robert, Julie submits that the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that a document entitled “Instructions” dated May 29, 1999
    constitutes a domestic contract in which Carlos agreed to renounce any claim he
    has to share in the monies advanced under the promissory note. In the
    alternative, Julie argues that the $220,000 is the value of an asset, the claim
    against her mother, that she brought into the marriage and this amount should
    be deducted when calculating her net family property.  In addition, Julie claims that the trial
    judge erred in failing to find that Julie is entitled to an unequal division of
    the parties’ net family properties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Finally, as the trial judge has not yet
    delivered a decision with respect to the costs of the trial, both parties asked
    that this court address that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Because the trial judge found that the
    promissory note <span class=GramE>was a</span> valid debt she did not address
    all of the alternate submissions; nor, as noted by Carlos, did she deal with
    the joint interest in the matrimonial home.  Both parties asked this court to exercise our powers under s. 134 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> to make all
    necessary findings so as to finally resolve the issues between them.  We agree that, to do so, is in the best interest
    of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b>i)
    The Debt Issue</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Julie
    and Carlos were married on July 6, 1991. It was Julie's second marriage and
    Carlos's first. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 1996, Julie and Carlos purchased a home on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Spyglass Crescent
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga
    for $187,000 and took title as joint tenants. They made a $20,000 down payment
    using funds received from Julie's mother, Phyllis Posa, and obtained a mortgage
    to pay the balance of the purchase price.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early 1996, Phyllis sued Julie and Carlos for
    $31,000, which she claimed they owed pursuant to various promissory notes.
    Julie and Carlos retained a lawyer named Michael Handler to defend the action,
    and Julie counterclaimed for $250,000 on account of monies she claimed Phyllis
    owed her in relation to properties Phyllis held for Julie and her first husband
    during Julie's first marriage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The litigation between Phyllis, Julie and Carlos
    proceeded over the next four years during which the parties exchanged numerous
    offers to settle. Phyllis wanted assurances that any settlement payment she
    made would be protected from Carlos in the event that his marriage to Julie
    broke down. However, given Phyllis’s history of suing her children, Julie was
    not prepared to accept any type of settlement arrangement that would allow
    Phyllis to force her to repay the settlement funds at a later date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two sets of Julie and Carlos’ instructions to Mr.
    Handler in relation to preliminary offers are noteworthy for the purposes of
    this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 11, 1996, Julie and Carlos signed a document
    entitled “Instructions” in which they rejected an offer from Phyllis and
    instead instructed Mr. Handler to settle the action for a payment of $175,000
    on terms that included the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Carlos Medeiros will execute whatever document is
    appropriate to confirm that he renounces any subsequently acquired right to
    share in the proceeds of settlement of this action which may form part of the
    joint family assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on May 28, 1999, Julie signed a further document
    entitled “Instructions”, which indicated that Phyllis wished to gift Julie
    $200,000 but “still insist[ed]” on Carlos renouncing any claim to the gift as a
    precondition to its payment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the May 28, 1999 Instructions, Julie acknowledged
    that if she and Carlos separated or divorced, Carlos would be in a position to
    claim monies that had been gifted to her by her mother unless there were
    written documents confirming that he renounced any claim to the gift. Julie
    confirmed that she was willing to attempt to settle the dispute with her mother
    on terms that included “execution of any document reasonably required to
    confirm that Carlos Medeiros renounce[d] any subsequent acquired right to share
    in the proceeds of [the] settlement.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, Julie and Carlos both signed an additional
    section of the May 28, 1999 Instructions in which Carlos confirmed that he had
    reviewed the May 28, 1999 Instructions, he did not want independent legal
    advice, he had “no desire to obtain a benefit from a financial gift by Phyllis Posa
    to Julie Medeiros if Julie and [he] were ever to separate or divorce,” and that
    he was “prepared to sign any appropriate document to accomplish that purpose.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some time in 2000, Robert Posa became involved in the negotiations
    to attempt to resolve the litigation between Phyllis, Carlos and Julie. On
    March 14, 2000, Julie and Carlos proposed the following settlement to Phyllis:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i)
    Phyllis would give $200,000 to Robert;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii)
    Robert would give $200,000 to Julie and Carlos; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii)
    Julie and Carlos would give Robert a promissory note for $220,000 with interest
    payable on demand and a mortgage against their home to secure the promissory
    note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, unbeknownst to Phyllis, Julie and Carlos and
    Robert also agreed that Robert would sign an acknowledgment that the promissory
    note had been satisfied as well as a discharge of the mortgage, that these
    documents would be placed in escrow with Mr. Handler, and that Julie would be
    given sole authority to have the documents released.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Phyllis subsequently provided the following response to
    Julie and Carlos's offer:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i)
    Phyllis would give $200,000 to Robert;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii)
    Robert would loan the $200,000 to Julie and Carlos if and when they granted him
    a mortgage on their home; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii) <span class=GramE>as</span> long as Robert obtained a first mortgage against
    Julie and Carlos's home and advanced the $200,000 to them, he would have no
    obligation to repay Phyllis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Phyllis gave the $200,000 to Robert at the end of March
    2000. On May 29, 2000, Julie and Carlos signed a promissory note under which
    they agreed to pay Robert $220,000 plus interest.  They also signed a mortgage to Robert as
    security for the promissory note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 30, 2000, Robert signed an acknowledgment that
    the promissory note had been satisfied and a discharge of the mortgage. These documents
    were placed in escrow with Mr. Handler and Julie was given sole authority to
    have them released.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 31, 2000, Mr. Handler received the $200,000 from
    Robert and disbursed the funds as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i)
    $154,065.40 to pay off two mortgages registered against the Spyglass property;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii)
    $31,034.60 to Michael Handler on account of legal fees; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=GramE>iii) $15,000 to Julie and Carlos.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That same day, Mr. Handler registered the mortgage against
    the Spyglass property and Julie and Carlos gave $15,000 to Robert to repay a
    debt they owed him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 11, 2000, Phyllis, Julie and Carlos signed
    mutual releases and minutes of settlement confirming the terms of their
    settlement. On December 15, 2000, the court action between Phyllis, Julie and
    Carlos was dismissed without costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 9, 2001, Julie and Carlos signed an
    agreement to purchase a property located at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    24 Beehive Drive in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bolton.
    In order to obtain financing for the purchase, Julie instructed Mr. Handler to
    register the discharge of Robert’s mortgage against the Spyglass property.
    Although Carlos disputed the issue at trial, the trial judge found that Carlos
    promised to give Robert a new mortgage to be registered against the Beehive
    property once the purchase was completed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Julie and Carlos sold the Spyglass property on July 24,
    2002 and completed the purchase of the Beehive property on September 3, 2002.
    No mortgage to Robert was registered at that time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Julie and Carlos began
    living separate and apart under the same roof on June 1, 2004. Subsequently, in
    about August 2004, Robert presented a new mortgage to Carlos to be registered
    against the Beehive property but Carlos refused to sign. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert demanded payment of the promissory note on
    October 13, 2004 and commenced his action against Julie and Carlos on November
    23, 2004. Carlos defended the action; Julie did not. Julie commenced a divorce
    application against Carlos on May 24, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a five-day trial, at which Robert and Julie
    were represented by the same counsel, the trial judge found that the mortgage
    against the Spyglass property that was discharged was simply collateral to the
    promissory note, that the promissory note to Robert had never been satisfied,
    and that the acknowledgment of satisfaction of the promissory note had never
    been released from escrow. She held that Carlos and Julie owe Robert $220,000
    plus interest from the date of the demand and directed that the principal and
    interest owing be split equally between them. In addition, she directed that
    Julie and Carlos enter into a new collateral mortgage in favour of Robert to be
    registered against the Beehive property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b>1.
    Did the trial judge err in finding there is a debt owing to Robert?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carlos submits that the trial judge erred in finding
    that there is a debt owing to Robert under the promissory note because it is
    clear from the documentary evidence that there was no expectation that the
    $200,000 advanced by Robert would ever have to be repaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree. Although the trial judge concluded at page 6
    of her reasons that all parties understood that Phyllis was obsessed with
    ensuring that no part of any funds she advanced to Julie would form part of
    Julie's net family property and that the only way to resolve the outstanding
    litigation “was to satisfy all concerned, in particular Phyllis Posa, that
    Julie's money would be safeguarded for Julie only, in case of marital breakdown”,
    the real issue in this case was whether the arrangements the parties entered
    into were effective to carry out that purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge erred in failing to take
    account of the documentary evidence demonstrating that there was an
    understanding between Robert, Julie and Carlos that Robert would never make a
    demand on the note and that, in fact, Robert had gifted the money to Julie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As was noted by the trial judge, at the time of
    entering into the settlement Julie and Carlos provided Mr. Handler on March 14,
    2000 with instructions that included the following terms:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>We
    Julie and Carlos Medeiros acknowledge that Julie's brother, Robert Posa, has
    been attempting to find a compromise solution to end the lawsuit between us as Defendants
    and Plaintiffs by Counterclaim and Phyllis Posa as Plaintiff and Defendant by Counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>We
    understand that the most recent proposal will cause Robert Posa to advance
    $200,000 to us (in trust to Michael A. Handler) upon a mortgage being
    registered against our home located at
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street
 w:st="on">
    7206 Spyglass Crescent,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga.
    The mortgage will be a collateral mortgage securing a promissory note by which
    we would promise to pay Robert Posa $220,000 on demand. The note would not bear
    interest except if there was a default.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>We
    are prepared to go along with the settlement because Robert Posa has assured us
    that he will never make a demand on the note. Robert Posa has also assured
    Michael Handler that he will sign a discharge of the mortgage once the mortgage
    is registered. The discharge of the mortgage will, however, only <span
class=GramE>be</span> registered on title at the specific written instructions
    of Julie Posa Medeiros. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>We
    are signing these instructions voluntarily in the hope of ending the
    outstanding legal proceedings. Carlos Medeiros acknowledges that the $200,000
    payment is directly intended to benefit his wife Julie and will only indirectly
    benefit him. Carlos Medeiros is, however, jointly and severally liable on the
    mortgage and promissory note to Robert Posa. <i>Carlos Medeiros understands that only Julie Posa Medeiros can instruct
    Michael Handler to retire this indebtedness</i> and to, that effect, therefore
    Michael Handler is in a conflict of interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Carlos
    acknowledges this conflict of interest. Carlos has been offered the opportunity
    of consulting with his own completely independent lawyer and is choosing not to
    do so. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it is clear from these instructions that the
    parties contemplated the creation of documents evidencing a loan, it is also
    clear that Julie would have sole control of additional documents evidencing satisfaction
    of that same loan and that Julie and Carlos only entered into the settlement
    “because Robert Posa ha[d] assured [them] that he [would] never make a demand
    on the note.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert confirmed this assurance in handwritten
    instructions to Mr. Handler given prior to the acknowledgment of satisfaction
    of the promissory note and the discharge of collateral mortgage being prepared:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>To
    Whom <span class=GramE>it</span> May Concern:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Although
    I hold a mortgage for $220,000 on the house on Spyglass for Julie &amp; Carlos
    Medeiros the[re] is no interest or principal in [<i>sic</i>]which is to be paid or will ever have to be paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Thank
    You.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Robert
    Posa</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert acknowledged that no principal or interest would
    ever have to be paid on the mortgage.  Although
    it appears that the primary purpose of Robert’s assurance was to ensure that
    Phyllis could not compel Robert to call the loan in the event she had a change
    of heart, the transaction could not constitute a loan in one set of
    circumstances but not in another. That is, in the face of Robert’s acknowledgment,
    there can be no finding of a valid debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in our view, the acknowledgement of
    satisfaction of the promissory note, the discharge of the mortgage, the escrow
    arrangements, and Robert and Julie's decision to somehow be represented in this
    litigation by the same counsel all belie the suggestion that there is a real
    debt owed to Robert. Rather, these documents and arrangements make it clear
    that Julie is and always has been entitled to the benefit of the $200,000. As
    such, these facts support a finding that Robert gifted the $200,000 to Julie at
    the time the monies were advanced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, we would set aside the trial judge's
    orders that Carlos and Julie owe Robert $220,000 plus interest under the
    promissory note and that Carlos and Julie enter into a new collateral mortgage
    in favour of Robert on the Beehive property. In their place, we would
    substitute an order dismissing Robert's action against Carlos and Julie<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of cross-appeal, Julie contends that the 1996
    and 1999 Instructions constitute either a domestic contract or an agreement to
    enter into a domestic contract under which Carlos renounced, or agreed to
    renounce, any claim to share in the proceeds of any settlement she received
    from her mother. In the alternative, she claims that Carlos should be estopped
    from resiling from his promises not to make any claim to a share of any
    settlement proceeds. In the further alternative, Julie relies on the doctrine
    of part performance to make Carlos’s promises enforceable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Julie claims that Carlos should not be
    permitted to commit a fraud on the court by resiling from the promises set out
    in the minutes of settlement under which the litigation with Phyllis was
    settled. <a name="P928_95853"></a><a name=s55s1></a><a name=BK59></a>We do not

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, none of the written statements upon which
    Julie seeks to rely constitute an enforceable domestic contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note, first, that the terms of the 1996 and 1999
    Instructions were not repeated in the written instructions Julie and Carlos
    gave to Mr. Handler in 2000 when the litigation with Phyllis was actually
    settled. This may have been because the structure of the settlement that was
    implemented differed from prior offers in that it purported to provide for a
    loan rather than a gift. Had the settlement involved a true loan, it would not
    have been necessary for Carlos to renounce any claims to the proceeds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, in our view, the 1996 and 1999
    Instructions simply do not apply to the arrangements that were made in 2000.
    There is no indication that either document constituted standing instructions.
    On the contrary, the parties provided distinct instructions on all three
    occasions. Moreover, the section of the 1999 Instructions that Julie alone signed
    states specifically, “[T]his settlement proposal &amp; these instructions therefore
    replace the earlier Offer to Settle of November 14, 1996 for 30 days only.
    Thereafter the earlier Settlement Offer becomes effective again.” These
    provisions are a clear indication that each of the 1996 Instructions and 1999
    Instructions constituted separate instructions.  It is accordingly not possible to treat the language in the 1996 and
    1999 Instructions as constituting an enforceable domestic contract between
    Carlos and Julie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, we are not satisfied that estoppel or part <span
class=GramE>performance have</span> any application in this case. Julie is
    attempting to rely on promises that are not contained in a domestic contract to
    have a portion of her share of the value of the parties’ matrimonial home
    excluded from her net family property. In our view, the legislature has made it
    clear that any such exclusion can only be accomplished by way of an enforceable
    domestic contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded that Julie is entitled to rely on
    a submission that Carlos is committing a fraud on the court.  The settlement of the litigation with Phyllis
    contemplated certain payments and agreements.  Julie, Carlos and Robert then entered into another arrangement that, in
    a sense, circumvented Phyllis’ intent that the funds only be lent to
    Julie.  In these circumstances, it is not
    open to Julie to assert that Carlos is committing a fraud on the court.  Furthermore, the only order obtained arising
    from the minutes of settlement was an order dismissing Phyllis’ action against
    Julie and Carlos; Phyllis has not advanced a claim in these proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the cases relied on by Julie have little
    bearing on the facts before us.  They all
    enunciate the equitable principle that a party cannot rely on a former fraud
    for his or her present claim.  Carlos
    seeks to rely on what we have found to be the true nature of the arrangement
    between Julie, Robert and himself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>3. Did
    the trial judge err in failing to find that Julie’s Claim Against her Mother
    was an Asset at the date of Marriage with a value of $220,000?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a telephone conference call held following the
    appeal hearing, Julie raised a further argument concerning the equalization
    calculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted in paragraph 11 above, in about 1996, Julie
    counterclaimed against Phyllis for $250,000 in relation to properties Phyllis
    held for Julie and her first husband, Tony Sacco, during their marriage. Phyllis
    eventually gave Robert $200,000 to settle the lawsuit, Robert paid the $200,000
    to Julie and Julie and Carlos gave the promissory note for $220,000 to Robert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If we do not accept Julie’s other arguments concerning
    the monies received from Robert (namely, the monies are a debt owing to Robert
    or they are excluded property under a domestic contract), Julie submits that
    the debt owing to her from Phyllis, which Julie brought into her marriage with
    Carlos, should be valued at $220,000. According to Julie, the amount of her
    settlement with Phyllis is the best evidence of the value of that debt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if it were appropriate to use hindsight to value
    the debt, we would not accept this argument. In our view, the elaborate
    arrangements made by the parties to try and insulate this money from any claims
    by Carlos, demonstrate that a significant component of the monies represented a
    gift to Julie from Phyllis, which everyone knew Julie intended to invest in the
    matrimonial home. If $220,000 was a true reflection of the asset Julie brought
    into the marriage, she was entitled to a deduction in that amount when
    calculating her net family property even though the money was later invested in
    the matrimonial home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from information in an Agreed Statement of Fact
    concerning the home Julie and Tony lived in prior to their separation (the “15
    Norglen property”), there was little evidence at trial to assist in valuing the
    debt owed to Julie by Phyllis on the date of Julie’s marriage to Carlos. The
    information in the Agreed Statement of Fact suggests that the maximum value of
    the total debt owing in relation to the 15 Norglen <span class=GramE>property</span> is $82,000, meaning Julie’s share would be $42,000. However, Phyllis paid Tony
    $50,000 to settle his action against her for his share of the debt. In our
    view, the $50,000 payment to Tony is the best evidence of the value of Julie’s
    share of the debt and we value the asset Julie brought into the marriage at
    $50,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>4.  Did the trial judge err in failing to find
    that Julie is entitled to an unequal division of the parties' net family
    properties?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Julie relies on ss. 5 (6)(f), (g) and (h) of the <i>FLA </i>claim that the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that she is entitled to an unequal division of the parties' net
    family properties. Those sections provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>5.
    (6) The court may award a spouse an amount that is more or less than half the
    difference between the net family properties if the court is of the opinion
    that equalizing the net family properties would be unconscionable, having
    regard to,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(f) <span class=GramE>the</span> fact that one spouse has incurred a
    disproportionately larger amount of debts or other liabilities than the other
    spouse for the support of the family;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(g) <span class=GramE>a</span> written agreement between the spouses that is not a
    domestic contract;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(h) <span class=GramE>any</span> other circumstance the relating to the
    acquisition, disposition, preservation, maintenance or improvement of property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a high threshold to find an equalization of
    net family properties “unconscionable”.  We
    are not satisfied that Julie can meet this threshold and therefore we do not
    accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Serra v. Serra</i>,
    2009 ONCA 105, this court described the threshold for unconscionability under
    s. 5(6) in the following terms at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this
    regard, the threshold of “unconscionability” under s. 5(6) is exceptionally high.
    The jurisprudence is clear that circumstances which are “unfair”, “harsh” or “unjust”
    alone do not meet the test. To cross the threshold, an equal division of net family
    properties in the circumstances must “shock the conscience of the court”: see <i>Merklinger
    v. Merklinger </i>(1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 233 (Ont. Gen. Div.), aff’d (1996), 30 O.R.
    (3d) 575 (C.A.); <i>Roseneck v. Gowling </i>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 789 (C.A.); <i>McDonald
    v. McDonald </i>(1988), 11 R.F.L. (3d) 321 (Ont. S.C.); and <i>LeVan </i>(S.C.J.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in this case was clearly satisfied that
    the purpose of the arrangements entered into between Phyllis, Robert, Julie and
    Carlos was to ensure that settlement funds advanced by Phyllis would not form
    part of Julie's net family property  and
    that Carlos understood that.  Given that
    the arrangement was not effective in law to achieve that purpose, and the fact that
    Julie ended up paying off more than her share of the parties’ liabilities, the
    question we now need to address is whether an equalization of net family
    properties rises to the level of unconscionability in this case.  In our view, it does not.  Julie had legal advice and could have asked
    Carlos to sign a domestic contract to shelter the settlement proceeds at the
    time the arrangements were made. She did not do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, assuming without deciding, that the
    circumstances of this case fall within the enumerated subsections of s. 5(6),
    those factors cannot be considered in isolation; rather, all relevant
    circumstances must be considered: <i>Roseneck</i> <i>v. Gowling </i>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 789
    (C.A.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, both Julie and Carlos contributed to the
    marriage.  In our view, Julie’s
    contributions were not sufficiently disproportionate so as to rise to the level
    of unconscionability.  The two were
    married for about 13 years prior to their separation. During the course of
    their marriage, Carlos worked seasonally for a period of time until he returned
    to school to obtain his certificate as a heavy equipment operator; Julie
    remained out of the full-time workforce for a period of time to care for their
    three children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following their move to the Beehive property, Julie and
    Carlos increased their mortgage by about $60,000 to pay expenses and reduce
    their other debts. Leaving aside the promissory note to Robert and without
    taking account of real estate fees or other selling expenses, their equity in
    the Beehive property on the date of trial was about $240,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the $220,000 issue, on appeal, the parties

    subtracting her liabilities on the valuation date of $109,267.90, $57,200 in
    property owned on the date of marriage and $5,800 in excluded property, Julie has
    a net family property of $82,535.43.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, Carlos owes Julie $28,156.98 as an
    equalization payment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the settlement funds intended for Julie
    account for about $150,000 of the $240,000 equity in the matrimonial home, the
    amount of the equalization payment might strike some as unfair. However, in our
    view, any unfairness that may exist does not <span class=GramE>rise  to</span>  the level of <span class=SpellE>unconscionability</span>.
    This is  particularly  the  case
     when  considered in light of
    the provisions of the <i>FLA </i>that favour
    an equal division of the value of the matrimonial home even where the home is
    brought into the marriage by one of the spouses or its acquisition is funded by
    gift, inheritance, or insurance or damage proceeds following the marriage,
    albeit subject to be equitable considerations set out in s. 5(6). </p>

    we direct that Julie be afforded an opportunity to purchase the matrimonial
    home at a price to be agreed upon, but that upon default of agreement within 90
    days, the matrimonial home should be sold and the net proceeds divided equally
    following payment to Julie of $34,156.98 together with accrued interest (being
    the equalization payment of $28,156.07 plus $6,000 in retroactive spousal

    pay Julie an equalization payment of $28,156.98 plus post-judgment interest, and
    for the buyout or sale of the matrimonial home on the terms set out above. In

    home for the purposes of the equalization calculation.</p>
