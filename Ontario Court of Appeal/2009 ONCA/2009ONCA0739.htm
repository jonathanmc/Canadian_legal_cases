  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of attempted murder with
    the use of a firearm and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.  He appeals his conviction and seeks leave to
    appeal his sentence.  In relation to
    conviction he raises three principal issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first is whether there is a reasonable doubt the
    appellant was the shooter.  The trial
    judge was alive to the fact that the victim did not pick the appellant out of
    two photo line-ups.  The trial judge did
    not rely on the evidence of identification of the victim alone but the totality
    of the evidence in coming to her conclusion including the circumstantial
    evidence of the appellant’s friend, Mr. Torres, who placed the appellant in the
    washroom just before the shooting.  The
    trial judge’s finding as to identity is amply supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to whether the appellant intended to kill
    the victim, the appellant relies on the victim’s statement to the police that
    he was unsure whether the shooter intended to kill him or whether the shooting
    was accidental.  This was but one
    factor.  The trial judge took into
    consideration the circumstances of the case including: 1) <span class=GramE>After</span> being ejected the appellant entered the bar with a loaded pistol concealed in
    his pant pocket.  2) When the victim went
    to prevent the appellant from going into the main area of the bar, he was told,
    “You don’t want to be doing this.” 3) After the appellant was pushed outside a
    second time, he had the option of simply leaving.  Instead he chose to go back inside and shoot
    the victim.  4) The appellant aimed the
    gun at the middle of the victim’s body at close range.  5) The injury was life threatening.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of intoxication, the appellant testified
    that he was not with Mr. Torres prior to going to the Fairbank bar.   Three rounds were bought at the Fairbank and
    there was still some beer left in the glasses after the incident.  No one testified that the appellant was
    intoxicated.  Even if the trial judge
    accepted the evidence of Mr. Torres that the appellant was drinking with him at
    another bar earlier that night, there was no evidence as to how much alcohol
    was consumed earlier.  We see no error in
    the trial judge’s rejection of the defence submissions in this regard.  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to sentence, we are of the opinion that
    having regard to all the circumstances, the sentence imposed was not outside
    the appropriate range of sentence for this offence and this offender.  Although the appellant is a young man with no
    prior criminal record, the shooting took place in a public place, the injury
    was serious and the victim has been left with a disability to his bowel that
    requires him to wear adult diapers for the rest of his life.  Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is
    granted, the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.  </p>
