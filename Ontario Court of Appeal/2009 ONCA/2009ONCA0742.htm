  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     This is a Crown appeal
    from the order of Nordheimer J. staying serious charges against six police
    officers because their rights to a trial within a reasonable time as guaranteed
    by s. 11(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> were
    infringed.  The trial judge estimated that some 56 months would have elapsed
    before the trial of five of the six officers, John Schertzer, Steven Correia,
    Joseph Miched, Nebojsa Maodus and Raymond Pollard (“the Schertzer
    respondents”), could be completed.  It would take even longer to complete the
    trial of the sixth officer, Richard Benoit.  The trial judge stayed the charges
    because, in his words:  “The vast majority of the time that has passed in this
    prosecution resulted from the Crown’s inability to make full and complete
    disclosure.”  He also found that the prosecution was characterized by
    complacency and a lack of awareness of the need to prosecute the case without
    delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     In our view, the trial
    judge made two fundamental errors in finding that the s. 11(b) rights of the
    Schertzer respondents were infringed.  First, he erred in finding that the
    delay was due to disclosure problems.  Whatever the problems with disclosure,
    and there clearly were some, delay in making disclosure had no impact on the
    progress of the prosecution.  There was no causal connection between problems
    with disclosure and the timing of the proceedings.  To the contrary, the delay
    was a reflection of the inherent time required to prepare and prosecute this
    complex case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Second, the trial judge
    erred by failing to follow the direction in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R.
    771, to expressly identify the causes for significant delays during the
    chronology of the case.  Of the 56-month delay, the trial judge only
    specifically allocated 18 months of delay to any <i>Morin </i>category.  The
    bulk of the time was unattributed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     The trial judge
    delivered his reasons on the s. 11(b) motion after months of pre-trial
    proceedings.  In those proceedings, he became very familiar with the long
    history of the charges before him, and the issues on which battle had been
    joined at the pre-trial stage.  It is fair to say he knew a great deal about
    the investigation that led to the charges and the pre- and post-charge
    management of the case by the prosecution.  Understandably, the trial judge
    formed certain opinions about the Crown’s conduct of the prosecution.  In some
    respects, he was clearly not impressed.  The trial judge was also justifiably
    concerned about the length of time the charges had been before the courts,
    particularly given the lengthy pre-charge history of the matter and what he
    found to be significant ongoing prejudice suffered by all accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Whatever the validity
    of the trial judge’s assessment of parts of the Crown’s management of this case
    – upon which we explicitly refrain from commenting – s. 11(b) is not the medium
    through which the quality of the prosecution’s performance is measured. 
    Section 11(b) focuses exclusively on delay and the causes of that delay, and
    this case proceeded in accordance with a schedule with which the accused and
    their counsel were content.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     When the causes of the
    delay are properly identified, there was no unreasonable delay in this case. 
    This complex case proceeded at the pace contemplated and dictated by the
    parties.  For this reason, the appeal in respect of the Schertzer respondents
    is allowed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     The respondent Richard
    Benoit stands in an entirely different position.  Following the preliminary
    inquiry, he was committed for trial only in relation to one set of allegations
    and, significantly, was discharged in relation to the most serious allegation,
    a charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.  It was anticipated that his trial
    would take no more than a week.  There was no reason why Benoit could not have
    had that trial within months of the committal, but for the Crown’s decision to
    proceed with the much more complicated trial of the Schertzer respondents
    first.  The resulting two-year delay is unreasonable and the trial judge
    properly stayed the charges against Benoit.  The Crown appeal with respect to
    Benoit is dismissed.</p>
  <h3>THE FACTS</h3>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>Introduction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     There is a lengthy
    history to this prosecution.  As such, to understand the positions of the
    parties and the proper analysis of the delay, it will be necessary to set out
    the chronology in some detail.  We will also refer to the lengthy pre-charge
    history, which provides some context for developments in the prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     In 1998, some members
    of the Toronto Police Service Central Field Command (“CFC”) drug squad came
    under investigation by their own police force.  That investigation led to
    internal disciplinary charges under the <i>Police Services Act,</i> R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.15, in 1998, and criminal charges in November 2000.  The <i>Police
    Services Act</i> charges were dismissed in 1998, because they had been laid out
    of time.  The 2000 criminal charges were stayed by the Crown in 2002, because
    they could not be prosecuted without compromising the more serious on-going investigation
    that ultimately led to the charges under consideration in this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those charges, which were laid against the respondents on January 7,
    2004, consisted of charges of attempting to obstruct justice, perjury, assault
    causing bodily harm, extortion, theft and conspiracy to obstruct justice.  The
    charges arose from five investigations the respondents conducted while they
    were members of the CFC drug squad.  </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The January 2004 Allegations</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The earliest allegation against any of the respondents in this
    prosecution relates to an investigation conducted by members of the CFC drug squad on January 30, 1997.  It is alleged that Schertzer, Pollard and others conducted
    an illegal search of the residence of an alleged drug dealer, Larry Vacon, and
    stole money that they seized during that search.  They then falsified their
    notes and other police records, claiming that they had obtained a search
    warrant before conducting the search, when in fact the search warrant was
    obtained after the search.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second set of allegations underpinning the 2004 charges is similar
    and relates to an investigation of an alleged drug dealer, Ho Bing Pang, on
    February 18, 1998.  It is alleged that the Schertzer respondents conducted a
    warrantless search of his residence, and falsified their notes and records to
    claim that the search took place after the search warrant had been obtained. 
    They then lied about the timing of the search at the preliminary inquiry of
    Pang and his co-accused, Yin Leong Chui.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third set of allegations arises out of the investigation of an
    alleged drug dealer, Kai Sum Yeung, on April 7, 1998.  Schertzer, Correia and
    Miched are charged in relation to this investigation.  The Crown alleges that
    the respondents falsified their notes and other records about the role of a
    police informant in this transaction and lied at Yeung’s preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fourth set of allegations relates to an investigation on April 30, 1998.  It is alleged that Schertzer, Correia, Maodus and Benoit repeatedly
    assaulted an alleged drug dealer, Christopher Quigley, over a nine-hour period
    in an attempt to extort information from him as to the location of his drugs
    and money.  While Quigley was detained, the respondents obtained warrants to
    search the residences of Quigley and his mother.  During the search of the
    mother’s home, the respondents learned that Mrs. Quigley was holding money for
    her son in a bank safety deposit box.  It is alleged that Schertzer and Correia
    subsequently seized approximately $54,000 from the safety deposit box, but
    reported seizing less than half that amount.  They falsified their notes and
    other police records to cover up the assault, extortion and theft.  This
    incident is the only one for which Benoit was ultimately indicted.  He was charged
    with assault causing bodily harm and extortion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conspiracy count alleges that the Schertzer respondents conspired to
    obstruct justice in relation to these four investigations as well as an
    investigation relating to two alleged drug dealers, Andreas Ioakim and Aida
    Fagundo.  The Ioakim/Fagundo allegation arises out of events around October 30, 1997.  It is alleged that the Schertzer respondents seized large amounts of
    money and drugs from Ioakim.  They reported seizing some of the drugs and none
    of the money and then forced Ioakim to set up a cocaine deal with Fagundo.  The
    Crown alleges that the Schertzer respondents falsified their notes and other
    records in relation to the investigation of both Ioakim and Fagundo.  The
    conspiracy count covers a period from January 1, 1997 to March 31, 2002.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The Pre-charge Events</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it appears that concerns about the CFC drug squad had been
    circulating for some time, the first formal charges against any members came in
    1998 in the form of charges under the <i>Police Services Act</i>.  On October
    2, 1998, the hearing officer dismissed those charges because they had not been
    laid within six months from the time when the facts on which the complaints were
    based first came to the attention of the chief of police, pursuant to s. 69(18)
    of the Act.  These charges related only to Schertzer, Maodus, Miched and
    Correia, and the underlying allegations did not form part of the criminal
    charges laid against the respondents in 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the investigation into the CFC drug squad continued, and on
    November 22, 2000, Schertzer, Pollard, Miched and Correia were arrested on <i>Criminal
    Code </i>charges of fraud, breach of trust, theft, forgery and uttering forged
    documents.  The charges related to allegations of misuse of a fund used to pay
    confidential police informants, the so-called “fink fund”.  The accused
    appeared numerous times in the Ontario Court of Justice in relation to these
    charges.  The charges were finally stayed on February 13, 2002, out of concern
    that the prosecution might compromise an on-going criminal investigation: the
    investigation of the CFC drug squad that ultimately led to the charges against
    the Schertzer respondents and Benoit that were laid on January 7, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between the spring of 2001 and December 2003, the officers investigating
    the CFC drug squad came to have reasonable and probable grounds to lay charges
    arising from a number of investigations by the CFC drug squad.  After obtaining
    advice from prosecutors, however, the police only laid charges in relation to
    the five CFC drug squad investigations described above.  The earlier “fink
    fund” charges were not re-laid and form no part of the allegations involved in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2001, the squad investigating the CFC drug squad was
    reorganized and renamed the “Special Task Force”.  The then Chief of the
    Toronto Police Service asked the R.C.M.P. for assistance with the
    investigation.  Chief Superintendent John Neily of the R.C.M.P. was placed at
    the head of the Special Task Force.  Importantly, in March 2003, Chief
    Superintendent Neily wrote a letter addressed to the Director, Special
    Prosecutions Unit of the Ministry of the Attorney General to update him on the
    progress of the investigation.  In that letter, Chief Superintendent Neily
    indicated that the Special Task Force believed that it had reasonable and
    probable grounds to lay 173 criminal charges against 9 officers of the CFC drug squad.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Chief Superintendent Neily went on to complain about a lack of
    assistance from the Crown and in particular its failure to review the court
    briefs that the investigators had provided.  Chief Superintendent Neily also
    expressed particular concern that the lack of action by the Crown would affect
    its ability to meet its disclosure obligations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Further, each time we
    have spoken of this, I have mentioned to you the overriding complexity of some
    of the priviledge [<i>sic</i>] issues and the results that this will have on
    witness and informant safety as well as other complicating factors. This will
    require an extraordinary effort on your part supplemented by my team to ensure
    that disclosure is appropriate.  About the only thing that has been resolved is
    a joint desire to have disclosure ready for arrest and a general protocol for
    that process. Yet despite providing you’re [<i>sic</i>] the required information
    in December for you to make application for resources to this end, I am told
    that this has yet to occur. I have and continue to offer technical and physical
    support to this end. In the meantime, we have reached the one million page mark
    of our investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unclear whether Chief Superintendent Neily sent this letter to the
    Director; the copy disclosed to the defence and filed on the s. 11(b) motion
    before the trial judge was clearly a draft and was not signed, dated or put on
    letterhead, as Chief Superintendent Neily’s other correspondence had been.  It
    is also unclear whether the alleged lack of co-operation between the Special
    Task Force and the Crown continued after March 2003.  There is no evidence of
    any response from the Director, and Superintendent Neily was not called on the
    s. 11(b) application.  In any event, some ten months later, charges were laid
    against only six officers of the CFC drug squad and only in relation to five of
    their investigations.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The Post-charge Chronology</h3>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>Proceedings in the Ontario Court of Justice</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The post-charge chronology is complicated and lengthy.  However, for the
    purpose of resolving the issues on these appeals it is only necessary to
    identify certain important markers relating to the pace of disclosure and the
    setting of dates for the preliminary hearing and the trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the respondents were arrested and released on January 7, 2004.  They were suspended with pay and were required to comply with various conditions
    of their release orders, including a no-contact condition and limits on travel
    outside Ontario.  The Chief of Police also initially required the respondents
    to report to work twice daily.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents first appeared in the Ontario Court of Justice on
    February 25, 2004.  Two days earlier, counsel for Schertzer wrote to the Crown
    requesting full disclosure as quickly as possible.  At the February court
    appearance, Crown counsel advised the court that disclosure would be
    “voluminous”, and said that he was “hopeful” disclosure could be completed “in
    a two or three-stage process” during March and April.  All of the respondents
    except Maodus appeared at this court date.  Maodus and Pollard did not yet have
    counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The matter was adjourned to April 2, 2004.  At that time, Maodus still did not appear, apparently because he was subject to bail conditions on
    unrelated charges that limited his ability to travel from his home in Windsor to
    Toronto.  Maodus and Pollard were still unrepresented.  (Maodus obtained
    counsel later in April 2004 and Pollard obtained counsel by June 2004.)  Crown
    counsel indicated that the first portion of disclosure was available but would
    not be provided until defence counsel agreed to give an undertaking as to the
    use of the material.  The Crown’s principal concern was that the material
    contained information identifying confidential informants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, all of the counsel agreed to provide this undertaking,
    except Schertzer’s then counsel.  The undertaking issue concerning Schertzer
    was not resolved until September 1, 2004, when Ewaschuk J. ruled that the Crown
    could require an undertaking as a condition for providing disclosure.  At the
    next court appearance in the Ontario Court of Justice on September 14, 2004,
    Schertzer’s counsel withdrew.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the September 14 appearance, Schertzer, who was now unrepresented,
    asked that he be given full disclosure as quickly as possible.  Crown counsel
    indicated that the Crown was looking into the question of providing disclosure
    to Schertzer.  He also addressed the question of disclosure more broadly, stating
    that disclosure had been ongoing for several months and that almost 100,000
    pages of disclosure had been provided to counsel for all the accused except
    Schertzer.  He stated there was a third large instalment of disclosure coming,
    which the Crown hoped to have delivered by the end of October.  He stated that
    counsel were agreeable to the case being adjourned to early to mid-November so
    that the matter could be spoken to after the delivery of the further
    disclosure.  Defence counsel agreed to the adjournment “for the purpose of
    further disclosure”, and Schertzer objected.  The case was adjourned to November 9, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By November 9, 2004, Schertzer had retained new counsel, who had provided
    the necessary undertaking respecting disclosure.  Crown counsel told the court
    that all counsel agreed that it was now time for a judicial pre-trial, which
    was subsequently scheduled for December 15, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judicial pre-trial took place, as scheduled, before Sheppard J.  The
    matter was then spoken to in court and a target date was set for the
    preliminary inquiry to begin in January 2006, some 13 months hence.  One factor
    favouring the January 2006 date was that an electronic courtroom would then be
    available.  The Crown had been making disclosure electronically.  Crown counsel
    said this in the presence of counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I can also note for the record that in setting the
    target date for the preliminary inquiry, the Crown and counsel and Justice
    Sheppard, the issue was raised as to whether counsel viewed the amount of time
    necessary for the target date of the preliminary inquiry as reasonable and
    counsel, I understand, indicated that it was a reasonable amount of time and
    there were/was no request or complaints about that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, counsel for Miched said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[J]ust for the record,
    though, there’s no complaints being made; but certainly at least on behalf of
    my client, nobody's waiving any rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of Miched’s counsel’s comments, Crown counsel wrote to defence
    counsel later the same day seeking to confirm that “counsel agree that the
    target date for our preliminary inquiry is reasonable, and that there are no
    concerns or complaints with respect to section 11(b) relating to the passage of
    time from today’s date to the proposed commencement date of the preliminary
    inquiry in January of 2006.”  Crown counsel also stated that if any counsel
    thought the proposed target date was not reasonable and might “contribute to an
    11(b) problem”, he wanted to be advised, as it was his understanding that an
    ordinary (i.e. non-electronic) courtroom would be available “considerably
    sooner” than January 2006.  Only counsel for Miched responded.  In his letter
    he confirmed that he was “not currently complaining about delay” but was also
    “not waiving any s. 11(b) rights.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of events took place in 2005, none of which resulted in a
    postponement of the scheduled start of the preliminary inquiry in January 2006. 
    First, the process of disclosure continued, with further disclosure being made
    in February, April, July, October and December 2005.  Much of this disclosure
    was new, but some of it was simply a reorganization of documents that had
    already been disclosed.  In September 2005, the Crown also provided a
    “consolidation” of all the disclosure made to date in a single database to
    allow for more efficient searching.  The parties offer different perspectives
    on the importance of this additional disclosure.  The Crown submits that it had
    disclosed the “heart” of its case in April 2004, and that the disclosure
    provided after this time was largely peripheral, the result of further
    investigative steps or in response to defence requests.  The defence submits
    that the 2005 disclosure – and indeed the disclosure that continued right up to
    the anticipated start of the trial – was essential to their ability to make
    full answer and defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in February 2005, Crown counsel informed the defence that he
    would be bringing an application to remove certain counsel on the basis of
    alleged conflicts of interest because they had represented some of the other
    accused persons or Crown witnesses in other proceedings.  On May 19, 2005, the
    respondents were arraigned before Blacklock J., the judge who would preside
    over the preliminary inquiry.  It seems that one reason for the arraignment was
    so that Blacklock J. would be able to deal with the conflicts application.  In
    the end, it was not necessary for Blacklock J. to do so because the Crown
    accepted waivers from the affected persons.  However, correspondence at the
    time indicates that the waivers were for the preliminary inquiry only and that
    the Crown intended to revisit the matter if the case proceeded to trial.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, beginning in September 2005, Blacklock J. conducted three focus
    hearings intended to narrow the issues for the preliminary inquiry.  During
    these hearings, defence counsel agreed that the disclosure was sufficient to
    permit the preliminary inquiry to proceed.  There were, however, continuing
    complaints from the defence about the state of disclosure and especially about
    excessive editing or vetting of the materials.  For their part, Crown counsel
    complained that the defence requests were not sufficiently specific.  On
    December 2, 2005, the case was adjourned to January 9, 2006, for the hearing of
    evidence at the preliminary inquiry.  Counsel estimated that the Crown’s case
    would take six weeks of court time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the preliminary inquiry occupied 45 court days, including
    the hearing of evidence and submissions.  During the preliminary inquiry,
    counsel for the respondents complained about disclosure.  On several occasions
    they received disclosure relating to a witness only shortly before that witness
    was to testify.  On at least one occasion they received disclosure relating to
    a witness who had already testified.  On four days the court adjourned early
    because of disclosure problems.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence was completed on March 30, 2006, and submissions were
    completed on April 28, 2006.  On May 31, 2006, Blacklock J. released lengthy reasons committing all the respondents for trial.  However, Benoit was
    discharged on the conspiracy count and committed for trial only on the charges
    of assault and extortion in relation to the Quigley matter.  Thus, to summarize
    some of the key proceedings in the Ontario Court of Justice:</p>

  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>Proceedings in the Superior Court of Justice:
    The Schertzer Respondents</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the committal for trial, the Crown prepared two indictments. 
    The long indictment charged the Schertzer respondents on 14 counts, including
    conspiracy to obstruct justice.  The short indictment charged only Benoit with
    assault causing bodily harm and extortion relating to Quigley.  The respondents
    appeared for the first time in the Superior Court on June 21, 2006.  However, prior to this date, the respondents launched <i>certiorari </i>applications
    to quash their committals for trial.  As well, the Crown launched an
    application to remove counsel for Correia, Schertzer and Miched on the basis of
    conflicts of interest.  On June 21, the case was adjourned to August 16, 2006.  In the meantime a judicial pre-trial was held on June 28, 2006.  At the
    pre-trial, the parties estimated that the trial of the long indictment would
    take six months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 16, 2006, Crown counsel asked for a trial date to be set. 
    However, Watt J. refused to do so, since the conflicts application was still
    outstanding and, as a result, it was unclear who would be representing two of
    the respondents.  (By this time, Schertzer had a new lawyer who did not have a
    conflict.)  The parties were having difficulty dealing with the conflicts
    application because of a dispute about the materials necessary to settle the
    issue.  Crown counsel suggested that the application could be dealt with on the
    basis of an agreed statement of facts.  Defence counsel contended that the
    entire transcript from the preliminary inquiry was required to show that there
    was no real foundation for the alleged conflicts of interest.  Watt J. set
    January 22, 2007 as the target date for the hearing of the <i>certiorari </i>applications,
    and adjourned the long indictment to October 25, 2006, to set a trial date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between August and October 2006, the parties were able to resolve the
    conflicts issue by the affected respondents and witnesses providing waivers. 
    The waivers were similar to those provided prior to the preliminary inquiry but
    now took into account that some of the respondents might testify and be
    cross-examined by their former counsel, who now acted for co-accused.  The possibility
    of resolving the conflict issue with waivers had apparently been raised by
    defence counsel in June, but was not pursued by Crown counsel until August.  By
    October 17, 2006, the necessary waivers had been provided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties appeared briefly on October 25, 2006, to set a trial date. 
    However, it became clear that setting a trial date would be somewhat complex
    because of commitments by some defence counsel and other, unrelated criminal
    trials involving Maodus which were scheduled for 2007.  Then J. adjourned the
    matter to November 3, 2006, to give counsel an opportunity to settle on a trial
    date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 3, 2006, Crown counsel told Then J. that defence counsel
    were not available to begin the trial until July 2007, and that, in the
    circumstances, everyone agreed it made more sense to begin the trial after the
    summer.  Thus, everyone was content to have the pre-trial motions begin on
    September 10, 2007.  Those motions would take most of the fall.  As a result, the
    suggested target date for the trial proper was January 8, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Miched confirmed that July 2007 was the earliest date all
    defence counsel were available, but noted for the record that the setting of
    the trial date had been held up until the conflicts issue could be resolved. 
    He also clarified that the decision to postpone the start of the pre-trial
    motions until September 2007 reflected the “practicalities” of commencing with
    the case over the summer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between November 2006 and September 2007, a number of other matters were
    dealt with.  The <i>certiorari </i>motions were heard and ultimately dismissed
    on February 15, 2007.  The parties had a series of case management meetings
    with Nordheimer J., who had been designated as the trial judge.  The Crown
    disclosed further material comprising more than 100,000 pages.  In a letter to
    defence counsel accompanying the largest batch of disclosure delivered during
    this time (comprising some 81,000 pages), Crown counsel explained that “much or
    most of the material is not properly or necessarily disclosable”, but was being
    provided “to avoid unnecessary debates later.”  The balance of the disclosure
    provided in the run-up to the start of the pre-trial motions was described by
    the Crown as duplicates of material provided during the preliminary inquiry, records
    relating to investigative steps taken in 2007 and materials provided in
    response to defence requests.  By September 2007, a total of approximately
    300,000 pages of disclosure had been provided to defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, there were continuing disputes about disclosure.  Counsel
    for the respondents complained about excessive vetting of the materials, gaps
    in the disclosure and the Crown’s failure to respond to disclosure requests in
    a timely way, if at all.  The Crown took the position that some disclosure
    requests should properly be dealt with as third-party records applications, and
    also argued that the defence had not been specific enough in its requests for
    disclosure to permit the Crown to respond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pre-trial motions commenced as scheduled before the trial judge on September 10, 2007.  A number of those motions related to disclosure, including motions for
    production of Crown briefs relating to the criminal records of various
    prosecution witnesses and an application to resolve disputes over what the
    defence claimed was excessive vetting of the disclosure materials.  There were
    also applications for production of third-party records concerning Pang,
    Quigley and Vacon, and applications to unseal informations used to obtain
    search warrants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the end of December, it was apparent that the pre-trial motions would
    not be completed in time to start the trial on January 8, 2007.  The date for
    jury selection was therefore pushed back to February 19, 2008, on the basis
    that the pre-trial motions would be concluded by February 1, 2008.  Some court
    time was lost during October and November because counsel for Correia was
    required to try another case and Crown counsel needed time to review the many
    edits of disclosure that, in the trial judge’s view, had not been properly
    explained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From January 7 to 11, 2008, the parties argued the application by the
    defence to stay the proceedings.  The defence application proceeded on two
    alternative bases.  First, they argued that their rights to a fair trial under
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter </i>had been violated.  In particular, they submitted that
    the combination of pre- and post-charge delay violated their fair trial rights
    because of the impact of lost evidence and fading memories.  Second, they
    argued that the passage of time from the laying of charges to the estimated end
    of the trial violated their s. 11(b) rights to be tried within a reasonable
    time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reserved his decision and in the meantime continued to
    deal with other pre-trial motions.  On January 31, 2008, the trial judge released his reasons staying the proceedings under s. 11(b).  He dismissed the s. 7
    application on the ground that it was premature to decide whether the
    applicants’ rights to a fair trial had been violated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, to summarize some of the key proceedings in the Superior Court of

  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>Proceedings in the Superior Court of Justice:
    Benoit</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the first appearance in the Superior Court of Justice in June 2006,
    counsel for Benoit sought the earliest possible trial date.  Crown counsel,
    however, took the position that Benoit’s trial should follow the trial of the
    long indictment.  On numerous occasions, Benoit’s counsel objected to this
    sequencing of the proceedings.  He also sought an early date to argue Benoit’s
    s. 11(b) motion and indicated that if he could get an early trial date he would
    abandon Benoit’s <i>certiorari</i> application.  At the request of Crown
    counsel, Then J. ruled that Benoit’s s. 11(b) motion would be heard with the
    similar motion brought by the Schertzer respondents.  Crown counsel asked that
    the s. 11(b) motions be heard first, but the trial judge accepted the Schertzer
    respondents’ suggestion that the disclosure motions be heard first.  While
    there was no firm estimate of how long the Benoit trial would take, there seems
    to be agreement that it would not exceed a week.</p>
  <h3>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered whether the respondents’ s. 11(b) rights had
    been infringed in light of the four factors identified by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Morin</i>: (1) the length of the delay; (2) whether the accused
    waived any time periods; (3) the reasons for the delay; and (4) prejudice to
    the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the first heading, the trial judge found that the overall time to
    be assessed was 56 months for the Schertzer respondents (i.e. from the date the
    charges were laid in January 2004 to the anticipated end of the trial in August
    2008).  The total time for Benoit would exceed 56 months since his trial was to
    commence after the trial on the long indictment was completed.  The trial judge
    found, and the Crown did not dispute, that these time periods were sufficiently
    lengthy to warrant an inquiry under s. 11(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge next found that there were no instances of defence
    waiver throughout the proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to the reasons for the delay.  Following <i>Morin</i>,
    he first considered the inherent time requirements of the case.  The trial
    judge accepted that the case against the respondents was a complex one, having
    regard to the number of accused persons and the sheer volume of disclosure. 
    However, he rejected the Crown’s submission that the complexity of the case
    justified the time taken to ready it for trial, because of the length of the
    pre-charge delay.  In his view, the pre-charge period should have been used to
    prepare the case, especially to prepare disclosure.  The trial judge found that
    Chief Superintendent Neily’s letter of March 2003 was clear evidence that the
    Crown had not used the pre-charge period as efficiently as it should have.  He
    went on to find that this state of affairs persisted after the charges were
    laid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite this, the trial judge was prepared to accept that a ten-month
    intake period in the Ontario Court of Justice was a reasonable, if lengthy one,
    given the complexity of the case.  He rejected the Crown’s submission that the
    timing of the preliminary inquiry was in any way affected by the problems some
    of the respondents had in retaining counsel, finding instead at para. 97, that
    “given the pace at which disclosure was being made, no earlier preliminary
    inquiry date could have been set.”  The trial judge was not prepared to accept an
    intake period in the Superior Court longer than the one-month period that he
    considered “normal”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning next to the actions of the accused, the trial judge rejected the
    Crown’s submission that the defence was responsible for the delay arising from
    Schertzer’s first counsel’s refusal to sign an undertaking as a condition of
    receiving disclosure.  The trial judge instead concluded that, given the
    unusual nature of the Crown’s request, the time taken to resolve the
    undertakings controversy was more properly treated as part of the inherent time
    requirements of the case.  It appears that this time was included in his
    calculation of the ten-month intake period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also rejected the suggestion that the defence
    contributed to any delay in agreeing to a target date for the preliminary
    inquiry more than 13 months away. To the contrary, he found that, had the
    defence insisted on an earlier date, an adjournment would likely have been
    required.  He explained at para. 111: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]f the state of
    disclosure was ultimately unsatisfactory when the preliminary inquiry began in
    January 2006, as it clearly was, it was not going to be any less so if the
    preliminary inquiry had commenced earlier.  I am satisfied that defence
    counsel, in agreeing to the January 2006 date, fairly and reasonably assumed
    that, if a somewhat lengthier period of time passed prior to the preliminary
    inquiry commencing, the prosecution would be able to ensure that disclosure
    would be largely, if not entirely, complete.&nbsp; The case could then proceed
    efficiently and without interruption.&nbsp; The fact that over 80,000 pages of
    disclosure were made throughout 2005 provides after the fact justification for
    the reasonableness of that assumption.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on to find that the only period of time
    attributable to the defence was one month of delay in setting the trial date. 
    The Schertzer respondents had indicated in November 2006 that they were not
    available to begin the trial until July 2007.  Based on the trial judge’s own
    knowledge of the state of the long trial list, it was apparent that the parties
    would have received a trial date about six months from the date of their
    request.  In other words, the trial would not have commenced before June 2007. 
    However, since the defence was not available until July, that one-month gap
    should be attributed to them.  The trial judge treated July and August 2007 as
    neutral time since all the parties agreed that it was not practical to start
    the trial during the summer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then considered the actions of the Crown and concluded
    at para. 116 that “the largest portion of the delay in this case results from
    the actions of the Crown relating to the manner and timing of the disclosure.” 
    Again, the trial judge found that the time it took for the Crown to make
    disclosure was particularly unreasonable having regard to the length of the
    pre-charge period.  He stated at para. 119 that as the police concluded that
    there were reasonable grounds to lay charges, “the process of readying
    disclosure should have begun.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not explicitly quantify the delay in the Ontario
    Court of Justice that he thought was attributable to the Crown’s approach to
    disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found that the Crown was responsible for a
    four-month delay in the Superior Court of Justice, owing to its decision to
    renew the conflicts application following the preliminary inquiry and its
    initial refusal to resolve the issue by way of waivers.  He did not
    specifically attribute any other delay in the Superior Court to the actions of
    the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on to find that there was no institutional delay in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the final <i>Morin </i>factor, the trial judge found that the
    delay had caused a great deal of prejudice to the accused, both inferred and actual,
    and that their liberty, security and fair trial interests had been affected.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In balancing the prejudice experienced by the accused with the public’s
    interest in having a trial on the merits, the trial judge found at para. 166
    that while the charges against the accused were not the “most serious offences
    under our criminal law”, they were serious charges made even more so because
    they involved police officers acting in the course of their duties.  The trial
    judge acknowledged that the public would reasonably expect that an officer
    accused of such crimes would be required to account for his actions in a court
    of law.  At the same time, however, the trial judge observed at para. 167 that
    the public “would expect that this accounting should happen expeditiously.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded at para. 172 that the Crown had failed in its
    obligation to bring the accused to trial within a reasonable time:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The vast majority
    of the time that has passed in this prosecution resulted from the Crown’s
    inability to make full and complete disclosure.</i>&nbsp; I have not forgotten
    the fact that this is a somewhat complicated case and that, as a consequence,
    more time will be required to get the case from the time of arrest to the trial
    door.&nbsp; I have made allowances for that fact in my allocation of time for
    the inherent time requirements of the case.&nbsp; The fact that the case may
    have a measure of complication associated with it cannot, however, be used as
    an excuse to provide the Crown with a blank cheque against the bank of time
    that would otherwise be considered to be reasonable to get a case to
    trial.&nbsp; <i>This is especially so, in my view, when the Crown fails to
    place any evidence before the court by way of explanation for what is
    presumptively inordinate delay.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, the trial judge found that Benoit’s s. 11(b) rights were
    clearly infringed.  The delay of more than five years before he could be tried
    was unacceptable and was caused by the Crown’s decision to try the large
    indictment first.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the Schertzer respondents, while the matter was not as
    clear-cut, the trial judge held that the passage of time in their case was also
    unreasonable.  He concluded that the Schertzer respondents’ interests in a
    prompt trial outweighed the societal interest in having the charges tried, and
    that a stay of proceedings was necessary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize, the trial judge expressly attributed the delay as follows:</p>
  <table width="45%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, of the 56 months under scrutiny, the trial judge expressly
    allocated only 18 months to any <i>Morin </i>category.  As to the balance of
    the time, we are left with the trial judge’s observation at para. 116 of his
    reasons that “the largest portion of the delay in this case results from the
    actions of the Crown relating to the manner and timing of the disclosure.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge failed to identify other obvious explanations for the
    delay such as the five months taken to complete the preliminary inquiry and the
    six months anticipated to complete the trial.  The trial judge did not
    expressly attribute the delay of 13 months from the date the preliminary
    inquiry was set until the evidence commenced, except to say that the period was
    not waived by the defence.  While he attributed one month between November 2006
    (when the trial date was set) and September 2007 (when the pre-trial motions
    began) to defence delay and characterized two months as neutral, he did not
    identify the reason for the remaining seven months.</p>
  <h3>THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has repeatedly held that the characterization of various
    periods of time is reviewed on a standard of correctness, as is the ultimate
    decision whether the delay was unreasonable:  see e.g. <i>R. v. Cranston</i> (2008), 244 O.A.C. 328 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Quereshi</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d)
    453 (Ont. C.A.).  However, the underlying findings of fact are reviewed on the
    standard of palpable and overriding error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error with
    respect to the impact of the Crown’s disclosure obligations on the delay.  This
    error undermines his ultimate determination that the delay in respect of the
    Schertzer respondents was unreasonable.  The trial judge also erred in failing
    to allocate lengthy periods of time to any category in the <i>Morin </i>framework. 
    In our view, these and other errors led the trial judge to come to the wrong
    conclusion in respect of the Schertzer respondents’ s. 11(b) application.</p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS: THE SCHERTZER RESPONDENTS</h3>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained above, the trial judge found that the “vast majority” of
    delay in this case was attributable to the Crown’s failure to make full and
    complete disclosure.  On appeal, the Crown submits that the trial judge erred
    by failing to quantify the amount of delay attributable to disclosure and by
    failing to identify those periods of time that, in his view, resulted from
    Crown disclosure practices.  Instead, the Crown submits, the trial judge placed
    undue emphasis on the volume of material disclosed throughout the course of the
    proceedings without regard to its content or to the circumstances under which
    it was provided, in order to reach his conclusion that an unreasonable delay
    had occurred.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents support the trial judge’s characterization of the
    reasons for the delay.  Further, in a compelling presentation before this
    court, counsel for Schertzer argued that the entire pace of the prosecution was
    dictated by the Crown’s approach to disclosure and that, had the Crown
    disclosed material as it should have in light of the lengthy pre-charge period,
    the case would have proceeded much faster.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with the Schertzer respondents’ submission is that it is
    simply not borne out by the record.  When the chronology of this case is
    reviewed in light of the positions taken by the parties throughout, it becomes
    clear that the trial judge’s broad finding that the vast majority of delay
    resulted from the Crown’s failure to make full disclosure in a timely fashion is
    unreasonable and constitutes a palpable and overriding error.  To the contrary,
    as we will explain, the time taken to bring the Schertzer respondents to trial
    should be regarded almost entirely as inherent time required to prosecute this
    complex case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We now turn to an analysis of the seven time periods that comprise the
    56 months between the laying of the charges and the anticipated end of the
    Schertzer respondents’ trial.  We will then assess the overall delay.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>Analysis of the 56-month delay</h3>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The first time period: January 7, 2004 –
    December 15, 2004</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We begin with the period from January 7, 2004, when the respondents were
    charged, to December 15, 2004, when the target date for the preliminary inquiry
    was set.  The trial judge at para. 101 of his reasons accepted that ten months
    was a reasonable, if lengthy, period for intake in the Ontario Court of
    Justice.  It appears that he included the time taken to resolve the undertaking
    issue as part of this period by characterizing it as part of the inherent time
    requirements of the case.  In our view, the eight months from January to
    September 2004 can be attributed to the intake period in the Ontario Court of
    Justice.  This was the time needed for counsel to be retained, initial
    disclosure to be made and the disclosure undertaking issue to be resolved.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the remaining three months, all accused except Schertzer agreed
    that the case should be adjourned from September to November so that the Crown
    could make further disclosure.  At this time, the Crown also had to determine
    how to make disclosure to Schertzer now that his counsel had, eight months into
    the case, removed himself from the record.  A two-month adjournment to deal
    with that issue and make further disclosure was not unreasonable and is also
    properly considered part of the intake period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, Schertzer did retain counsel in the interim.  The case
    was adjourned for an additional month, to December 2004, for the pre-trial. 
    None of the counsel, including Schertzer’s new counsel, objected to this
    adjournment.  This is hardly surprising considering that Schertzer’s counsel
    had just received thousands of pages of disclosure.  All counsel would require
    some reasonable period of time to prepare for the judicial pre-trial.  They
    were about to set the date for a proceeding which would demand considerable
    time and resources.  In the circumstances, a one-month adjournment is properly
    considered an aspect of the intake period and thus part of the inherent time
    requirements of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, we would characterize this entire time period as part of the
    inherent time requirements of the case. </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The second time period: December 15, 2004 –
    January 9, 2006</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second period to be considered is the 13 months between the setting
    of the target date for the preliminary inquiry and the commencement of that
    proceeding.  This is the key period for the purpose of the s. 11(b) analysis
    because, although the trial judge did not specifically allocate this time to
    the Crown, he found that no earlier date could have been chosen because of the
    inadequacy of the disclosure.  In our view, that was speculation.  There is
    nothing on the record to support such a finding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The closest one comes is in Miched’s counsel’s letter of December 17,
    2004, confirming the January 2006 target date, in which he wrote in part as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, we are not
    at the point of which we can assess the reasonableness of any delay or even the
    intake period for that matter, since we do not have full disclosure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary, my
    client’s position is that he is not currently complaining, but he would like to
    deal with this matter in a timely fashion.  He is currently indifferent in
    relation to the use of the electronic courtroom, but I have yet to receive all
    disclosure in this matter, therefore, I am unable to make a full informed
    decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, that letter cannot fairly be read as a claim that the
    preliminary hearing date was set for 2006 because the defence did not have
    enough <span style='line-height:200%'>disclosure</span> to proceed any sooner. 
    To the contrary, counsel expressly stated that he was not complaining about the
    delay.  Further, as we explained above, this letter was sent in reply to a
    letter written by the Crown immediately after the target date was set, in which
    Crown counsel sought assurances that the contemplated 13-month delay was
    “reasonable” and that “there are no concerns or complaints with respect to
    section 11(b)” vis-à-vis the target date.  The Crown concluded his letter by
    stating that if he had clearly stated counsel’s “common understanding and
    position” there was no need to reply to the letter.  Only counsel for Miched
    responded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, though the trial judge correctly found that more than 80,000
    pages of disclosure were provided by the Crown in 2005, the numbers do not tell
    the whole story.  Counsel for Miched made precisely this point in his
    submissions on the s. 11(b) motion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he material isn’t
    quite as large as it might seem if you just look at the numbers.  The
    prosecution in this case has provided documents and there were thousands of
    pages that were useless or weren’t properly part of the prosecution’s case. 
    And those included things such as cover pages, blank pages, duplicated
    material.  So as you go through the material, you may go through one portion
    and find a warrant and – sorry.  A letter or series of documents and then go
    through another portion of disclosure.  It’s been repeated either three or four
    times.  So the material isn’t quite as voluminous as it quite appears.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found at para. 111 of his reasons that the state of
    disclosure was clearly “unsatisfactory” in December 2004 when the target date
    for the preliminary inquiry was set, as evidenced by the fact that “over 80,000
    pages of disclosure was made throughout 2005.”  However, in so finding, he
    mistakenly equated the volume of disclosure with the significance of
    disclosure.  Not only was much of the disclosure a duplication of earlier
    disclosure, some of it was arguably peripheral and some of it related to events
    that occurred in 2005.<b>  </b>It follows that the trial judge erred in
    concluding that an earlier preliminary inquiry date would inevitably have been
    adjourned owing to inadequate disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also erred in finding at para. 109 of his reasons that
    the contemporaneous correspondence leading up to the setting of the target date
    for the preliminary inquiry “makes it clear that there was considerable
    frustration at, and opposition to, the delays in receiving disclosure.”  To be
    sure, the record reveals such exchanges, but they occurred in the immediate
    run-up to the preliminary inquiry and after it – not in the months leading up
    to the setting of the target date in December 2004.  The exception is
    correspondence from Schertzer’s first counsel to the Crown demanding disclosure
    in early 2004, but this must be considered in the context of his refusal to
    sign the disclosure undertaking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our conclusion that disclosure problems did not affect the scheduling of
    the preliminary inquiry is supported by subsequent appearances in the Ontario
    Court of Justice in 2005.  Between February and September of that year the
    parties appeared for a variety of reasons, but there is no indication in the
    record that the target date was in jeopardy because of the pace of disclosure. 
    Significantly, while disclosure was discussed at the three focus hearings
    before the preliminary inquiry judge in the fall of 2005, at no time did the
    defence suggest that <span style='line-height:200%'>disclosure</span> was
    insufficient to permit them to proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Crown argues that the defence should be seen to have
    waived this entire time period.  The waiver submission is founded on the
    principle set out in <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1120, and reiterated
    in <i>Morin</i> that consent to a court date can give rise to an inference of
    waiver, unless that agreement is mere acquiescence to the inevitable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to look at exactly what Sopinka J. said at p. 1136 of <i>Smith</i> that is the foundation for the waiver argument:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Agreement by an
    accused to a future date will <i>in most circumstances</i> give rise to an
    inference that the accused waives his right to subsequently allege that an
    unreasonable delay has occurred. While silence cannot constitute waiver,
    agreeing to a future date for a trial or a preliminary inquiry would generally
    be characterized as more than silence. Therefore, <i>absent other factors</i>,
    waiver of the appellant’s s. 11(b) rights might be inferred based on the
    foregoing circumstances.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acquiescence to the inevitable is one circumstance that will show that
    counsel has not impliedly waived the accused’s s. 11(b) rights.  But there can
    be other circumstances and other factors that will indicate that there was no
    waiver.  This case presents such an example.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a complex proceeding.  By the time counsel came to set a date
    for the preliminary inquiry, they had the equivalent of approximately 125,000
    pages of disclosure in hand, with the promise of more to come.  While some
    counsel had had the disclosure for some time, Schertzer’s then counsel had only
    recently been retained.  The expectation was that the preliminary inquiry would
    last for many weeks.  Crown and defence counsel required time to prepare.  The
    selection of a target date some 13 months away afforded them that opportunity. 
    The January 2006 date also allowed for the use of the electronic courtroom,
    which was clearly advantageous given that disclosure had been made
    electronically.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the best interpretation of the events leading up to the
    setting of the target date was that counsel were all of the view that 13 months
    was a reasonable time to prepare for a difficult preliminary inquiry.  This is
    consistent with Crown counsel’s statement made at the time the date was set,
    where he indicated that “counsel viewed the amount of time necessary for the
    target date as reasonable” and “there were/was no request or complaints about
    that.”  It is also consistent with the fact that, apart from counsel for
    Miched, no other defence counsel responded to the Crown’s letter soliciting
    objections to the reasonableness of the target date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further point.  Defence counsel’s agreement to set a target date for
    the preliminary inquiry, even though more disclosure was anticipated, is
    consistent with this court’s direction in <i>R. v. M. (N.N.)</i> (2006), 209
    C.C.C. (3d) 436 (Ont. C.A.), where Juriansz J.A. said the following at para.
    37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even when the Crown
    has clearly failed to make mandated disclosure, the defence is not necessarily
    entitled to refuse to proceed to the next step or to set a date for trial. As
    this court stated in <i>R. v. Kovacs-Tator</i> (2004), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 91 at
    para. 47: “the Crown is not obliged to disclose every last bit of evidence
    before a trial date is set.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would be an odd result if counsel, by acting responsibly in
    accordance with this court’s directions, were deemed to have waived their
    clients’ rights.  In our view, the 13-month period was part of the inherent
    time required to prepare for the lengthy preliminary inquiry.  Some of it might
    conceivably be considered reasonable institutional delay as the time necessary
    for the electronic courtroom to be available, but the record does not permit us
    to make a conclusion on this point.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The third time period: January 9, 2006 – May
    31, 2006</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This time period was taken up with the preliminary inquiry.  Once the
    preliminary inquiry began, it proceeded as scheduled, except for four days when
    court adjourned early owing to disclosure issues.  While the defence complained
    on many occasions about disclosure being made during the preliminary inquiry,
    the pace of disclosure did not otherwise affect the pace of the preliminary
    inquiry.  To the contrary, the preliminary inquiry started and finished within
    the anticipated time frame.  Moreover, many of the disclosure issues about
    which the defence complained were not by any means clear cut.  There were
    serious questions on grounds of relevancy and privilege about whether or not
    disclosure of certain materials was required.  In accordance with <i>Stinchcombe</i>,<i> </i>these questions would have to be resolved by the trial judge.  Many of the
    disclosure issues were a direct result of continuing, extensive demands from
    defence counsel.  This time period was part of the inherent time requirements
    of the case.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The fourth time period: June 1, 2006 – November
  3, 2006</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the intake period in the Superior Court of
    Justice was one month.  He made this finding based on his experience in the
    court, and we would defer to his assessment.  However, that finding fails to
    account for the approximately one month between the committal for trial (June
    1) and the first appearance in assignment court (June 21).  In our view, that
    time is also part of the intake period in the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the respondents’ first appearance in the Superior Court of
    Justice there was a four-month period from June 21 to October 17, 2006, which
    the trial judge attributed to the Crown’s refusal to accept waivers to resolve
    the conflicts issue.  In our view, this was an error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained above, prior to the preliminary inquiry the Crown signalled
    its intention to seek to remove certain counsel on the basis of conflicts of
    interest.  This issue was resolved through the provision of waivers from the
    affected parties.  Upon accepting the waivers, Crown counsel expressly
    indicated that they were valid for the purpose of the preliminary inquiry only,
    and that the issue would likely be renewed for the purpose of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately upon receipt of the order committing the respondents for
    trial, the Crown commenced an application to remove counsel for Miched, Correia
    and Schertzer because of the alleged conflicts of interest.  Schertzer later
    retained new counsel and so the application ultimately only concerned counsel
    for Miched and Correia.  At the judicial pre-trial on June 26, 2006, co-counsel
    for Correia apparently raised the possibility of resolving the conflicts issue
    by waivers, as had been done at the preliminary inquiry.  Crown counsel did not
    accept the offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    submissions before the trial judge, Crown counsel explained his initial
    reluctance to accept waivers.  In short, he was of the view that accepting
    waivers to deal with the conflicts issue was somewhat risky.  The risk was a
    tolerable one at the preliminary inquiry.  For one thing, as explained in
    correspondence prior to the preliminary inquiry, if one of the accused resiled
    from his waiver, the Crown had the remedy of preferring a direct indictment. 
    However, for the trial, the Crown initially sought the finality of a court
    ruling to deal with the conflicts issue.  The risk was also more likely to
    crystallize at the trial because one or more of the accused who had been
    represented by Correia’s or Miched’s counsel might testify and be subjected to
    cross-examination by his former counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the
    trial judge, Crown counsel also explained his change in position and why the
    Crown ultimately decided to accept waivers similar to those that had been
    offered at the preliminary inquiry.  In short, the conflicts application was
    becoming bogged down in procedural wrangling over the record that was necessary
    for hearing the application.  Defence counsel were insisting that the whole
    preliminary inquiry transcript was required, while Crown counsel wanted to
    proceed on the basis of an agreed statement of facts.  More importantly, the
    assignment judge in the Superior Court of Justice understandably refused to set
    a trial date until the conflicts issue was resolved, since until then the court
    would not know who would be acting for the various respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus on
    August 18, 2006, Crown counsel wrote to outside counsel who had been retained
    to argue the conflicts application and asked whether he was prepared to provide
    waivers, in which case the Crown would reconsider its position.  Counsel did
    not respond to this overture, prompting Crown counsel to write to counsel for
    the respondents directly on September 15, 2006.  The text of the letter shows
    that the Crown was acutely aware of the passage of time and was eager to set a
    trial date as soon as possible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    letter set in motion the waiver process and by October 3, 2006, Crown counsel
    had been provided with copies of the waivers.  Signed copies of the waivers
    were delivered to the Crown during the week of October 17, 2006.  The waivers
    were similar to those provided for the purposes of the preliminary inquiry but
    also addressed the question of waiving conflict of interest as a ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge held that the Crown was responsible for four months of delay because of
    its decision to launch the conflicts application rather than seek waivers, as
    had been done before the preliminary inquiry.  He said that the Crown had not
    offered an explanation for the different positions taken before the preliminary
    inquiry as opposed to the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our
    view, the trial judge erred in attributing the four months while the conflicts
    issue was resolved to actions of the Crown.  He misapprehended the record in
    stating that there was no explanation for the different positions taken before
    the preliminary inquiry and the trial.  We have set out the explanation
    provided in submissions to the trial judge.  The Crown’s position was a
    reasonable one.  The parties were about to embark on a difficult and complex
    six-month trial.  The possibility of disqualifying conflicts of interest was
    real and the Crown’s application was not frivolous, arbitrary or taken in bad
    faith.  The risks were different and greater at the trial than at the
    preliminary inquiry.  The Crown had every reason to be concerned about the
    trial being derailed by a conflict of interest.  A conflict could result in a
    mistrial and even further lengthy delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown
    moved promptly to bring the conflicts issue to the attention of counsel and the
    court.  The Crown also indicated it was willing to reassess its position on the
    question of waiver two months after the first court appearance in the Superior
    Court of Justice.  There was no response to that suggestion for a month.  Close
    to one more month elapsed before the waivers were in place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While an
    argument could be made that the time required to resolve the conflicts issue
    should be divided between actions of the Crown and actions of the accused, it
    is more realistic to consider this as part of the inherent time requirements of
    the case.  The issue had to be resolved.  In retrospect, four months seems a
    long time to do so, but it was not so unreasonable that this court should
    attempt to dissect the delay and assign responsibility accordingly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The manner
    in which the Crown approached the conflicts issue also provides an example of
    the Crown taking steps to expedite the proceedings.  It was Crown counsel who
    sought to simplify and expedite the conflicts application through an agreed
    statement of facts.  And when it became apparent that the application was
    leading to delay, the Crown raised the possibility of waivers, prompted in part
    by a desire to secure a trial date.  This is inconsistent with the trial judge’s
    finding at para. 179 that there was nothing in the record to show that the
    Crown had made an effort “to move this matter forward more quickly, more
    efficiently and more proactively”.  Other examples include the Crown’s
    willingness, both in the Ontario Court of Justice and in the Superior Court, to
    agree to earlier dates if the accused were dissatisfied with the pace of the
    proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within
    days of the Crown receiving the waivers, the parties re-appeared to set a trial
    date but were unable to settle on a date at that time, apparently because they
    had expected the court to provide them with possible dates.  The matter was put
    over a week, and on November 3, 2006, the trial date was set.  We would not
    attribute the time between October 17, when the waivers were received, and
    November 3, when the trial date was set, to either side but would simply
    characterize this as neutral delay.  </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The fifth time period: November 3, 2006 –
    September 10, 2007</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we
    explained above, at the set date appearance on November 3, the court was
    informed that the defence was not available to start the trial before July
    2007, and that in the circumstances everyone agreed it made more sense to begin
    the trial with pre-trial motions in September 2007.  There is no suggestion on
    the record that the trial was set more than ten months away because of problems
    with <span style='line-height:200%'>disclosure</span>.  Rather, the date was
    dictated by defence counsel’s availability and the fact that Maodus had other,
    unrelated trials scheduled for 2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    stay ruling, the trial judge declined to find that the Schertzer respondents
    waived the period between the setting of the trial date and the start of
    pre-trial motions, but he did attribute one month to them due to their
    unavailability in June 2007.  As we explained above, this was because, even
    though the Schertzer respondents were not prepared to proceed until July 2007,
    the trial judge found at para. 104 that “in the normal course, once counsel are
    ready to set a trial date on the long trial list, they can expect to receive a
    trial date that is about six months away.”  If counsel had indicated in
    November 2006 that they were prepared to accept the first available date, that
    date would have been in June 2007.  However, the respondents were not actually
    available until July.  The trial judge therefore concluded that they were
    responsible for the delay from June to July 2007.  He characterized the delay
    from July to September as neutral.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept
    the trial judge’s finding that in the normal course, accused on the long trial
    list in Toronto can expect to receive a trial date that is about six months
    from the time they are ready to set the date.  Ordinarily, this would be
    considered institutional delay, assuming the parties are otherwise ready to
    proceed.  The trial judge, however, found that there was no institutional delay
    in this case.  In the result he did not characterize the six-month period
    during which both the defence and the court were unavailable.  In our view, the
    six-month period was either waived by the defence or was part of the inherent
    time requirements of the case.  The delay was not caused by the Crown.  We
    accept the trial judge’s characterization of the summer months as neutral time.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The sixth period: September 10, 2007 – January
    31, 2008</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This time
    period was taken up with pre-trial motions and concluded with the issuance of
    the stay ruling.  As noted above, the trial judge did not account for this
    five-month period in his <i>Morin </i>analysis.  Before this court, counsel for
    the Schertzer respondents submit that most of the time consumed in pre-trial
    motions was a direct consequence of Crown disclosure practices, and that this
    time should therefore be attributed to the Crown.  The Crown initially took the
    opposite view, arguing that the time taken for pre-trial motions should mostly
    be attributed to the defence.  However, in oral argument, we took the Crown to
    have retreated from that position and instead argued that the pre-trial motions
    should be considered part of the inherent time requirements.  We agree with
    that submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily,
    the time taken to complete the trial, including resolution of pre-trial
    motions, the hearing of evidence and, in a judge-alone case, time while the
    decision is under reserve, is part of the inherent time requirements of the
    case.  It is neither Crown delay because the Crown seeks to adduce certain
    evidence nor defence delay because the defence objects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exceptionally,
    the time taken at trial will lead to a finding of unreasonable delay.  <i>R. v.
    Rahey</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, was such a case.  There the trial judge
    reserved for 11 months to resolve a motion for a directed verdict, a matter
    that should have been resolved in a few days.  We can also envisage
    circumstances where time spent during pre-trial motions could be attributed to
    either the Crown or the defence.  If the trial judge concluded that defence
    motions were frivolous and served no legitimate purpose, the time to deal with
    those motions might be attributed to the defence.  Similarly, if the trial
    judge was of the view that, for example, the Crown acted arbitrarily or in bad
    faith in refusing to make disclosure or unnecessarily delayed the proceedings
    by failing to accept reasonable admissions from the defence, the resulting
    delay could be attributed to the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge here was obviously concerned with the pace of disclosure.  He also made
    rulings that indicate he disagreed with the Crown’s overall approach to
    disclosure.  For example, he held that the Crown had not satisfactorily
    explained many of the passages that had been edited out or vetted.  It is also
    apparent that the trial judge considered that the time taken to make disclosure
    prior to trial was unsatisfactory.  That view may have been coloured in part by
    the trial judge’s erroneous finding that disclosure should have been prepared
    as the police found they had reasonable and probable grounds to lay a charge, a
    matter to which we will return shortly.  That aside, we have not been persuaded
    that the time taken to resolve the disclosure issues during the pre-trial
    motions was due to arbitrary or bad faith conduct by the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would
    consider the five months spent on pre-trial motions part of the inherent time
    requirements.   We acknowledge that not every day of that time was used for
    argument.  At different times the Crown or defence requested adjournments to
    prepare their materials.  Some time was lost because counsel for Correia had to
    conduct another trial.  It will also be recalled that the trial proper was to
    commence on January 8, 2008, but the start date was pushed back to February 19
    to allow more time for pre-trial motions.  The respondents submit that this
    time was caused by the Crown’s failure to make adequate disclosure.  In our view,
    this is not a reasonable characterization of this period.  For various reasons
    the pre-trial motions took longer than expected.  Those reasons are complex and
    not by any means due solely to disclosure issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short,
    during the pre-trial motions counsel were engaged in a difficult and complex
    task. The time taken was reasonably necessary to provide a coherent record for
    the trial judge. </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'><i>The seventh period: February 1, 2008 – August
    2008 </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the
    charges were stayed on January 31, 2008, this final period represents time that
    would have passed had the trial proceeded as scheduled.  As explained above,
    pre-trial motions were expected to conclude by February 1, with jury selection
    beginning on February 19.  The trial was expected to wrap up by the end of
    August, lasting a total of six months.  Obviously, the time taken to conduct
    the trial should be considered part of the inherent time requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, we would attribute the following periods of time to the inherent
    time requirements of the case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Intake in the Ontario Court of Justice:     11
    months</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Intake in the Superior Court of Justice:   2 months</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Time from

    months</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, we would attribute one month of delay to the Schertzer respondents in
    scheduling the trial.  We would attribute an additional six months of delay in
    scheduling the trial either to defence waiver or to the inherent time
    requirements.  The summer preceding the start of the pre-trial motions was
    neutral time, as was the approximately three-week period in the fall of 2006
    between when the waivers were received and a trial date was set.  This accounts
    for the 56 months that passed between the laying of the charges and the
    anticipated end of the trial on the long indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><i>Assessment of the overall delay</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    L’Heureux-Dubé J. explained in <i>R. v. Conway</i>,<i> </i>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659,
    at p. 1674,  the court must evaluate the reasonableness of the overall delay
    and not simply focus on individual time periods when assessing a claim under s.
    11(b).  Arbour J.A. made a similar point in <i>R. v. Bennett</i> (1991), 3 O.R.
    (3d) 193 (C.A.), at p. 211, aff’d [1992] 2 S.C.R. 168, where she observed that
    “[i]t is easy to lose sight of the importance of the total period of delay” and
    that “[u]ltimately, it is the reasonableness of the total period of time that
    has to be assessed, in the light of the reasons that explain its constituent
    parts.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have
    demonstrated, far from this being a case where the vast majority of the 56
    months passed because of the Crown’s failure to make full disclosure, virtually
    none of the time can be so characterized.  Rather, the bulk of the time that
    passed is attributable to the inherent time required to prosecute this complex
    case.  In <i>Morin</i>,<i> </i>at pp. 791-92, Sopinka J. observed that inherent
    time requirements will vary with the complexity of the case. There was a
    dispute here as to the degree of complexity of the case.  The Crown submits
    that the case is highly complex.  The defence submits that the case is
    relatively straightforward, essentially involving several discrete events.  The
    dispute is reflected in the trial judge’s reasons at para. 87 where he
    observed, on the one hand, that the case was complicated by the volume of
    disclosure, and on the other hand, that the charges against the accused were
    relatively straightforward and may not have warranted such extensive
    disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are
    a number of objective factors that suggest this was a very complex case.  The
    long indictment included five accused.  It related to events over a five-year
    period.  While, as the trial judge noted, the substantive counts concerned
    discrete events, the Crown also alleged an overall conspiracy to obstruct
    justice.  The complexity of the case is reflected in the length of the
    preliminary inquiry (six weeks of evidence), the time for the pre-trial motions
    (five months) and the projected length of the trial (six months).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally
    there is the disclosure.  As the trial judge noted, by the time of the motion
    to stay the proceedings, the Crown had disclosed the equivalent of over 330,000
    pages.  However the complexity of the case is not simply reflected in the
    volume of disclosure, which, as explained above, is a somewhat misleading
    measure.  The disclosure also required considerable editing or vetting because
    of privilege concerns.  The defence made numerous extensive demands for disclosure,
    some of which were litigated in the pre-trial motions.  There were also
    requests for documents held by third parties.  Many of the disclosure and
    third-party demands did not relate to the core of the Crown’s case, but
    concerned matters going to the credibility of Crown witnesses.  For example,
    the defence sought the Crown briefs that underlay the convictions of a number
    of Crown witnesses.  Some of these Crown briefs were held by the Toronto Police
    Service, but others were in the possession of other police forces and related
    to convictions that were entered many years earlier.  The defence cannot at
    once contend that this was a simple case which could be tried in relatively
    short order, and at the same time make extensive disclosure and third-party
    records requests that significantly add to the complexity of the case and
    lengthen the time needed to get the case to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plainly,
    this was a complex case.  The inherent requirements of such a case will serve
    to excuse longer periods of delay than for cases which are less complex.  The
    trial judge, in our view, made two related errors in his approach to the
    complexity of the case and hence his approach to the inherent time
    requirements.  First, he held that the disclosure should have been prepared as the
    officers concluded that they had reasonable grounds to lay charges.  Second, he
    considered that in view of the lengthy pre-charge delay, the time that could
    reasonably be allowed to make disclosure should be shortened. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the
    first error, relying in part upon Chief Superintendent Neily’s letter, the
    trial judge suggested at para. 119 that once the officers had reasonable and
    probable grounds to lay a charge “there is no reason why someone could not have
    been tasked with beginning the preparation of the disclosure relating to those
    charges.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In many
    prosecutions, the police should be in a position to provide the Crown with the
    disclosure very soon after the charges are laid, so that the Crown can then
    provide disclosure to the defence.  But this was not an ordinary case.  As the
    trial judge noted, the police reviewed many transactions, only some of which
    led to charges being laid.  The police, quite reasonably, were not prepared to
    lay charges until they had obtained advice from the Crown.  It would have been
    a waste of time and effort to begin preparation of disclosure before the
    decision was made about the charges to be laid.  The courts should be wary
    about imposing deadlines for pre-charge preparation: see <i>R. v. Atkinson </i>(1991),
    5 O.R. (3d) 301 (C.A.), at p. 318, aff’d [1992] 3 S.C.R. 465.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in
    paras. 89-91, the trial judge held that the time the authorities take to “ready
    their case prior to charges being laid” must have an impact on what should be
    considered the inherent time requirements of the case.  He noted at para. 91
    that “the allegations surrounding these officers and others became the subject
    of investigation commencing at least by 1998.”  He returned to this subject at
    paras. 120-122, where he held that “if the charges have, as in the case here,
    been preceded by a lengthy and exhaustive investigation, that fact should
    militate against any suggestion that a longer period of post-charge delay can
    be justified for the purposes of making disclosure.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the relevant period of pre-charge delay did not go back to 1998.  While the CFC drug squad had been under investigation since 1998, if not earlier, the investigation into
    the events that led to the charges in the long indictment commenced in August
    2001.  The earlier<i> Police Services Act</i> charges and the “fink fund”
    charges were not part of the allegations in the long indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the
    complexity of the case, it is our view that the inherent time requirements are
    necessarily longer than might otherwise be considered appropriate.  In reaching
    this conclusion, we should not be taken as either validating or criticizing the
    pace of or the Crown’s approach to disclosure.  However, it must be borne in
    mind that the defence approach to disclosure will impact on the pace of the
    proceedings.  Some counsel may choose to pursue every possible relevant piece
    of information in the Crown’s possession, while other counsel may choose a more
    focused attack on specific crucial Crown witnesses.  Neither approach is
    necessarily unreasonable, but the former approach can result in significantly
    longer inherent time requirements.  </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>Prejudice to the Schertzer Respondents</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge found that the respondents suffered actual and inferred prejudice as a
    result of the delay.  The trial judge inferred prejudice to the respondents<span
lang=EN-US>’ security interests from the “inevitable stress” that arises when
    criminal charges are outstanding for “prolonged periods of time”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge gave lengthy and comprehensive reasons for finding actual prejudice.  Each
    of the respondents filed lengthy affidavits setting out the nature of the
    prejudice they experienced.  As the trial judge noted, these affidavits had
    common themes.  The respondents all stated that they essentially lost their
    employment as police officers, although most of them continued to receive pay
    while under suspension.  They lost opportunities for advancement and extra pay
    from overtime and paid duty.  The trial judge described the respondents as
    having become pariahs in the police community.  Most of the respondents were
    being treated or had been treated at different times for depression.  They were
    subject to various restrictions on their liberty, such as complications when
    travelling to the United States and limitations on their ability to socialize
    with each other.  A particularly disturbing aspect of the prejudice was that
    members of the Special Task Force appear to have intentionally leaked
    information regarding the investigation to the media.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge also found prejudice to the respondents’ fair trial interests because of
    the impact of the delay on witnesses’ memories and the loss or disappearance of
    evidence.  When considering the respondents’ application under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the trial judge was not prepared to conclude at the pre-trial stage that those
    problems had so impaired the respondents’ fair trial rights as to warrant a
    stay of proceedings.  However, when considering the s. 11(b) application, the
    trial judge held at para. 155 that “the delay in this case both in its impact
    on memories and the loss or disappearance of evidence is indisputable and, by
    definition, it has affected the fair trial rights of the [respondents]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it
    was open to the trial judge to find that there was prejudice due to faded
    memories, in our view, the impact of the delay on lost evidence was not
    established by the respondents.  The respondents failed to establish that any
    of the evidence would have existed had the case come to trial within a shorter
    time.  They also failed to show that the evidence, had it existed, would have
    assisted their case, as opposed to bolstering the prosecution case.  The
    respondents relied upon five instances of lost records.  We will deal with one
    to show the problem with the lost evidence argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jonathan
    Reid was a member of the CFC drug squad at the relevant time and interviewed
    Quigley’s mother on the night of Quigley’s arrest.  The respondents claimed
    that Mrs. Quigley had told Reid that there was only $20,000 to $25,000 in her
    safety deposit box.  The respondents claimed that by the time of trial, Reid’s
    steno notes of that part of the interview, which would have bolstered the
    defence position that there was no theft from the safety deposit box, no longer
    existed.  The difficulty with this submission is that there was a serious
    contest as to what had happened to these notes.  While the defence submitted
    they had been lost during the STF investigation, the Crown submitted that in
    fact Schertzer had destroyed the notes.  There was no other evidence to support
    the contention that the steno notes would have assisted the defence; the notes
    in Reid’s memo book and the information to obtain the warrant to search the
    safety deposit box do not contain any reference to the amount of money
    contained in the box.  Although Reid testified before the trial judge, the
    trial judge made no finding that the steno notes ever existed.  He referred at
    para. 70 of his reasons simply to the “unresolved issue regarding possible loss
    of an officer’s notes relating to the monies that were alleged to be in the
    Quigley safety deposit box.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, it was open to the trial judge to find that there was inferred
    prejudice and actual prejudice to the respondents’ liberty and security
    interests.  It was also open to him to find some inferred prejudice to the
    respondents’ fair trial interests because of faded memories: see <i>R. v. Godin</i>,
    2009 SCC 26, at paras. 35-36. We are not persuaded that prejudice by reason of
    lost evidence was made out.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>Balancing </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    balancing the Schertzer respondents’ rights to a trial within a reasonable time
    against the societal interest in a trial on the merits, the most significant
    factor is that almost all of the delay was due to the inherent time
    requirements of the case.  The lengthy delay was not the result of Crown or
    defence conduct or a lack of institutional resources.  Simply put, this was a
    complex case that required and would require significant expenditures of court
    time at the preliminary inquiry, pre-trial and trial stages.  It was also a
    case that required time for all the parties to prepare adequately.  The case
    imposed significant burdens on the Crown and the respondents in dealing with
    and responding to the extensive disclosure.  There was no submission made to
    this court that the Crown made too much disclosure or that the Crown and police
    should not have responded to the defence demands for further materials beyond
    the core disclosure that was made in 2004.  The case also posed unique problems
    because of the involvement of confidential informants as witnesses, which led
    to the need for editing and vetting of disclosure materials.  As the case
    proceeded through the Ontario Court of Justice and the Superior Court of
    Justice, the parties all recognized that this was a case that would require a
    lengthier period of time to prepare.  There can be no better gauge of the
    reasonableness of that delay than the positions the parties took when they set
    the target date for the preliminary inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Objectively
    speaking it is not unreasonable that a case that would require some 16 or 17
    months of court time at the Ontario Court and Superior Court levels, would take
    some time to prepare.  Admittedly, 56 months is a lengthy period of time, but
    it was not unreasonable.  These were very serious charges.  As the trial judge
    noted at para. 166:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal'>The possibility that police
    officers intentionally embarked on a course of conduct designed to distort the
    criminal process, from the laying of charges through the disclosure process and
    ultimately to the evidence that they gave in court, strikes not only at the
    very foundation of our justice system, it also seriously undermines the public
    confidence that our police services must enjoy if they are to function
    effectively.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This serious
    and complex case proceeded at the pace contemplated and accepted by the accused
    and their counsel.  The Crown submits that, in the absence of any delay that
    can be properly attributed either to systemic factors or otherwise attributed
    to the Crown, it is unnecessary to engage in a balancing analysis.  We do not
    have to address that submission.  Assuming that prejudice remains a relevant
    consideration, we are satisfied that in the balancing required under s. 11(b),
    the Schertzer respondents’ rights to a trial within a reasonable time were not
    infringed, notwithstanding the prejudice to their liberty and security
    interests and the prejudice resulting from fading memories inevitable in a case
    that relates to events that took place many years earlier.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Giving
    full weight to the prejudice suffered by the respondents because of the delay,
    the charges should not have been stayed.  This case proceeded slowly but it
    also proceeded at the pace dictated by its complexity and the actions of all
    the parties.</p>
  <h3>REMEDY – Schertzer respondents</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the
    hearing of the appeal, the court raised with counsel whether, if the appeal
    were to be allowed, the court should order a new trial or order that the trial
    proceed before the trial judge.  In <i>R. v. Allen</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d)
    331 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d [1997] 3 S.C.R. 700, this court left open the question
    of whether the court has the jurisdiction to set aside the stay and direct a
    continuation of the trial from the point where the stay was entered.  Since <i>Allen</i>,
    Martin J.A. in <i>R. v. Yelle</i> (2006), 397 A.R. 287 (C.A.), has written
    convincingly that an appeal court does have the jurisdiction to make such an
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel submitted that a new trial was preferred.  Counsel for the respondents
    argued that we should order the trial to continue so as not to lose the
    progress that has already been made in pre-trial motions, thus risking a
    further delay.  We do not share the respondents’ counsels’ concern.  All the
    parties have repeatedly stated that they are interested in a speedy trial.  While
    the judge at the new trial will of course not be bound by any of the rulings or
    findings of fact made by this trial judge, all counsel can demonstrate their
    commitment to a speedy trial by agreeing, if deemed appropriate, that rulings
    made by this trial judge will apply at the new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is
    not a proper case to order a continuation, especially in light of findings made
    by the trial judge in his s. 11(b) ruling that could have an impact on future
    applications by the defence under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> as to the
    significance of the lost evidence and responsibility for problems with
    disclosure.  In our view, this is a case for the usual order made by this
    court, that there be a new trial.  In so ordering, we trust that all counsel
    will move with an appropriate sense of urgency to get this matter back on
    track.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ANALYSIS – BENOIT</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our
    view, Benoit stands in a starkly different position from the Schertzer
    respondents.  The approximately 29-month delay to his committal for trial is
    fully explained and not unreasonable; it is what occurred thereafter that led
    to a violation of Benoit’s rights.  From the first appearance in the Superior
    Court of Justice in June 2006, counsel for Benoit sought the earliest possible
    trial date.  Benoit’s trial was relatively simple and could have been tried
    within a few months.  The trial itself would have taken, at most, one week, not
    six months as was the projected length of the trial of the long indictment.  It
    was because the Crown took the position that Benoit’s trial should follow the
    trial of the long indictment that some two and a half to three years more would
    elapse before Benoit could be tried.  That a relatively simple case should take
    that time to try in the Superior Court of Justice after the lengthy period of
    time spent in the Ontario Court of Justice is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept
    that the courts should be hesitant to second guess or monitor the tactical or
    strategic decisions of Crown counsel in deciding the order in which cases are
    tried.  But where that decision leads to an unreasonable and unnecessary delay,
    the courts must protect the accused.  Obviously, the trial court will give
    careful consideration to Crown submissions as to the order in which trials
    should proceed.  But once the two indictments were laid before the Superior
    Court of Justice, that court had the power to order that Benoit’s trial proceed
    before the trial of the long indictment so as to protect his constitutional
    rights.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short,
    Benoit should not have been held hostage to the trial of the long indictment. 
    No cogent reason has been provided as to why the Crown could not try Benoit
    first.  Benoit had a right, which his counsel repeatedly sought to vindicate,
    to have his trial held as soon as possible.  That trial did not have the
    complexities of the long indictment trial.  Benoit suffered serious prejudice
    from the delay.  The difference between him and the other respondents is that
    the delay in his case is unjustified and inexcusable.  His case, while serious,
    does not have the same seriousness as do the charges in the long indictment,
    especially the allegation in that indictment of a long-standing conspiracy to
    obstruct the course of justice.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the Crown appeal with respect to Schertzer, Correia, Miched, Maodus and
    Pollard, is allowed, the stay of proceedings is set aside and a new trial is
    ordered.  The Crown appeal from the stay of proceedings against Benoit is
    dismissed.</p>
