  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant brought a motion
    under rule 21.01(3)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194,<i> </i>for an order dismissing or staying the respondent’s
    application on the ground that sections 132 and 134 of the <i>Condominium Act
    1998</i>, S.O. 1998, c.19, mandates that the dispute be resolved through
    mediation and arbitration and therefore the Superior Court has no jurisdiction
    over the matter.  The appellant appeals from the dismissal of its motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What connects these parties is a
    condominium development in which the appellant, Martin Simard, is the owner of
    three units: the other respondents in this proceeding (not participating in
    this appeal) are tenants who live in Simard’s units.  The respondent is the
    board of directors of the condominium corporation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dispute centres on Simard’s
    having rented his units to students.  The respondent contends that as a result,
    Simard is in violation of Part III, s. 5 of the declaration of the condominium
    corporation which provides that “each unit shall be occupied only as a one
    family residence.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent brought this
    application against Simard for a compliance order under s. 134 of the <i>Act</i> requiring him to comply with ss. 83 and 119<i>.  </i>As against the tenants,
    the respondent seeks an order terminating their tenancies claiming that the
    tenants are in breach of the occupancy restriction in the declaration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 21.01(3)(a), under which the
    respondents brought the motion, provides that “[a] defendant may move to have
    an action stayed or dismissed on the ground that . . . the court has no
    jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of the appellant’s
    argument on the motion was that s. 132 of the <i>Act</i> requires mediation and
    arbitration when, as here, there is a disagreement with respect to the
    declaration.  The appellant contends that the motion judge erred in not
    applying the clear wording of the legislation and consistent jurisprudence that
    s. 132(4) applies to the dispute between the parties and that the respondent is
    therefore precluded from making an application to the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion judge’s reasons for
    dismissing the motion are brief:</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify'>This motion under rule 21 is
    dismissed on the following grounds:</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify;'>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this
    case involves intertwined issues under the Condominium Act and the Condominium
    Declaration that go beyond the owners of the units and the Corporation, who are
    the only parties referred to in the requirement of mediation-arbitration in
    s.132(4) and (1); and</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify;'>(ii) there is no
    appellant authority accepting Justice Juriansz’s “generous interpretation” of
    “disagreement between the parties” as including the validity and interpretation
    as a matter of law.  In my view, this application is proceeding to a hearing at
    this stage without significant factual disputes and the sole issue comes down –
    not to factual and behavioural issues, perception of those issues by the
    parties and the meaning of rules of a Declaration provision (such as pet rules
    or unreasonable noise) as in the cases cited involving only the unit owner and
    the corporation – but to the validity in law of the family provision in the
    Declaration as well as whether reasonable steps have been taken by the
    Respondent unit owner.  Even the latter must give way to the prime issue of
    validity in law.  Unlike <i>Peng</i>, this is not, as far as I can see, a case
    involving issues of conduct and use and gradations thereof, but to whether a
    unit owner is bound by what he alleges to be a provision in violation of the
    Ontario Human Rights Code and is discriminatory.</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify'>Finally, <u>all
    the issues in this case should be determined on the whole record in the
    Application proceeding and not on a summary motion like this involving
    sectioning off the unit owner and proceeding only against the respondent
    tenants.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties agree that section 132(2)
    of the <i>Act</i> makes it clear that the mandatory mediation and arbitration
    provision do not apply to disagreements between the corporation and tenants or
    occupiers.  Consequently, if the appellant’s motion succeeded, the proceedings
    would have to be split.  The respondent’s claims against the appellant would
    proceed by way of mediation and arbitration.  The respondent’s claims against
    the tenants would continue on by way of this application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(5) of the <i>Arbitration
    Act</i>, <i>1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c.17, states as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify'><a
name=s7s5></a>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may stay the proceeding
    with respect to the matters dealt with in the arbitration agreement and allow
    it to continue with respect to other matters if it finds that,</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify'>(a) the agreement deals with only some of the matters in respect of which
    the proceeding was commenced; and</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify'>(b) it is reasonable to separate the matters dealt
    with in the agreement from the other matters.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>Charron J.A. described this subsection in <i>Brown v.
    Murphy</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 404 at para. 12, as granting a discretion to a
    trial judge to refuse a stay of proceedings where it is unreasonable to
    separate the matters subject to arbitration from the other matters that were
    part of the claim and were not subject to arbitration.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 138 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34 provides that multiplicity of proceedings
    should be avoided.  Rule 1.04 sets out the objective of securing the just, most
    expeditious and least expensive determination of the matter on its merits.  Proceeding
    against the appellant in one forum and the tenants in another would arguably run
    contrary to both provisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arbitration provisions do not
    apply to all of the matters raised in the application.  All of the matters can,
    however, be addressed by way of an application.  The motion judge had to decide
    whether it was appropriate to proceed in one or two different forums.  His decision
    to avoid “sectioning off” the two main aspects of the claim and to proceed in
    one forum was within his discretion.  We see no reason to interfere.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unnecessary to express any
    view concerning the other divide between the parties, namely whether this
    dispute falls under ss. 132 and 134 and is therefore subject to the statutory
    obligation of mediation and arbitration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, we would
    dismiss this appeal with costs fixed in the amount of $5,000 including
    disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
