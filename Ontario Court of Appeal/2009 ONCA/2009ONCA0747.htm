  <h2>The Fresh Evidence Motion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed fresh evidence concerns the translation of a document that
    was before the motion judge.  That document was clearly important to one facet
    of the motion.  We now have competing interpretations of that document placed before
    us on appeal.  In our view, this is a matter that could have and should have
    been addressed by the appellant on the motion if he wished to challenge the
    version of the document put forward by the respondent on the motion.  The
    evidence will not be admitted on appeal.  </p>
  <h2>The Appeal Itself</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We required submissions from the respondent only in respect of certain
    specific terms of the motion judge’s orders.  The motion judge made two
    orders.  We will refer to one as the contempt order and the other as the order
    on the second motion.  </p>
  <h2>The Contempt Order</h2>
  <h3>(a)  Re the finding in para. 2 of that order</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the appellant was in breach of paras. 6, 8,
    10, 14 and 15 of the order of Clark J.  The respondent had not sought a finding
    that the appellant was in breach of paras. 14 and 15.  We see no evidence in
    the motion record to support a finding of any breach of those terms.  We cannot
    agree with the submission by counsel for the respondent that the failure to
    provide the Talaq as required by para. 8 of Justice Clark’s order constituted a
    breach of paras. 16 and 17.  Those two paragraphs are not connected by their
    language to the granting of the Talaq.  We note that Justice Clark’s order was
    on consent and presumably the language of his order is the language used by the
    party in framing the consent order.  Paragraph 2 should be varied to exclude
    reference to paras. 14 and 15 of Clark J.’s order.</p>
  <h2>The Order on the Second Motion</h2>
  <h3>(b) Re paras. 16 and 17 of the order made on the
    second motion </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 16 is a restraining order and para. 17 is a child transfer
    order.  Both are punitive insofar as they impact the appellant.  Neither order
    was requested.  There was no evidence before the motion judge to support either
    order.  In particular, there was no evidence that the appellant posed a threat
    to anyone’s safety.  Indeed, we were told in the course of oral argument that
    the parties have reached an agreement with respect to visitation and that the
    agreement is functioning.  Paragraphs 16 and 17 should be struck from the
    order.</p>
  <h3>(c) Re para. 13</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of para. 13, a real estate lawyer is holding some
    $104,000, the appellant’s share of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial
    home.  The $104,000 is the net amount after certain deductions set out in para.
    13, including $30,000 payable for child support under the order of Clark J.  The
    $104,000 is being held pursuant to para. 13 as security for any child support
    order that may be made against the appellant in the future.  Under the terms of
    the consent order of Clark J., no child support order can be made before
    December 2011.  The consent order does not indicate that any child support
    order will necessarily ever be made against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent did not seek an order restricting the appellant’s access
    to those funds except as part of her contempt motion.  That motion targeted the
    appellant’s failure to provide the Talaq as required.  The Talaq has now been
    provided.  We do not think that the appellant had any notice that his share of
    the proceeds of the sale of the house could be tied up indefinitely on the
    basis that he could not be relied on to make child support payments if any
    support order were to be made against him after December 2011.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence to support the inference that if a child support
    order was made against the appellant, he would not comply.  In fact, there is
    no basis on this record to determine whether any child support order will ever
    be made against the appellant.  We are satisfied that the part of para. 13 of
    the order of the motion judge requiring that the appellant’s share of the
    proceeds of the sale of the house be held by the real estate lawyer as security
    for further child support payments must be struck.  Those proceeds should be paid
    to the appellant subject to the deductions set out below in para. 9 of this
    endorsement.  </p>
  <h2>Costs</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has had some, but limited success.  In the circumstances,
    there should be no order as to costs on the appeal and the costs on the motion
    should be left as ordered by the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel made further submissions after we had delivered our
    endorsement.  We were advised that the costs order made by Justice Snowie on
    the motion below had not been paid and we were further advised that the
    differential referred to in para. 13 of her order had not been paid.  Counsel
    for the respondent advises that the differential is $5,000.  The costs order
    made by Snowie J. is in the amount of $5,339.51.  We are satisfied that both of
    those amounts can be paid out of the amount being held in trust by the real
    estate lawyer, that is the $104,000.</p>
