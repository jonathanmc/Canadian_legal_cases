  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>I.         INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises the issue of the jurisdiction of the Ontario Labour
    Relations Board to amend its reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 7, 2006, a fire caused extensive damage to a Petro-Canada
    plant.  A dispute arose over the characterization of the nature of the work
    required to repair the plant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dispute came before the Ontario Labour Relations Board by way of a
    grievance under the <i>Labour Relations Act, 1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A
    (the “<i>LRA</i>”). After a lengthy hearing, the Board rendered a two-page
    decision (the “first set of reasons”).  Shortly thereafter, counsel for the
    successful party, the respondent, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
    Workers, (the “IBEW”), asked the Board to provide “fuller reasons for its
    decision”.  This request was resisted by the unsuccessful party, Jacobs
    Catalytic Inc., on the basis that the Board lacked jurisdiction to render
    supplementary reasons.  Notwithstanding this objection, the Board released a
    redrafted decision (the “second set of reasons”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacobs’ application to the Divisional Court for judicial review, on
    grounds that included a challenge to the Board’s jurisdiction to issue the
    second set of reasons, was dismissed by a majority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Jacob’s appeal to this court, a preliminary issue has been raised concerning
    the Board’s jurisdiction to issue supplementary reasons.  This issue is particularly
    important to the determination of this appeal as the parties agree that the
    Board’s first set of reasons are inadequate.  Accordingly, if the Board lacked
    jurisdiction to render the second set of reasons, Jacobs has been denied
    procedural fairness and the appeal must be allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Divisional Court erred in finding that the Board had
    jurisdiction to issue the second set of reasons.  Accordingly, for the reasons
    that follow, I would allow the appeal and send the matter back for a new hearing
    before a differently constituted Board. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>II.        BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts leading up to the hearing before the Board are only relevant
    to put the issues surrounding the Board’s reasons in some context.  I will
    therefore summarize them but briefly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacobs and the IBEW are bound by two collective agreements: a project
    agreement for maintenance, by contract in Canada applicable to the Petro-Canada
    site (the “GPMA”), and the principal agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The GPMA is between Jacobs and the General Presidents’ Maintenance
    Committee for Canada (the “GPMC”), a council of 13 building trade unions.  The
    GPMC negotiates and administers GPMAs across Canada that bind both large
    maintenance contractors, such as Jacobs, and the 13 unions including the IBEW,
    to a set of terms and conditions for the performance of maintenance work by union
    members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal agreement is a “provincial agreement” as defined in s. 151(1)
    of the <i>LRA</i>, between the Electrical Trade Bargaining Agency of the
    Electrical Contractors Association of Ontario (the “ETBA”) and the IBEW.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A significant difference between the two collective agreements is that
    the GPMA provides for wage rates of $1.00 per hour less than the principal agreement,
    overtime after 40 hours per week rather than 37.5 hours per week and no
    interruption of work during a provincial construction strike. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacobs took the position that the fire restoration work is maintenance
    work, properly falling under the GPMA.  The IBEW grieved, claiming that Jacobs
    should have applied the principal agreement to the work in question on the
    basis that under the <i>LRA</i>, the work is construction work.  The grievance
    was referred to the Board for arbitration pursuant to s. 133 of the <i>LRA</i>. 
    The Board granted the GPMC and the ETBA intervener status.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board heard evidence over 6 days from 9 witnesses and received
    written and oral submissions before reserving its decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its first set of reasons, two pages in length and released on
    November 15, 2006, the Board dealt with two issues: whether the work in
    question was maintenance or construction within the meaning of the <i>LRA</i>;
    and, if construction, whether the doctrine of estoppel should apply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board upheld the grievance, concluding that the work was within the
    definition of construction work under the <i>LRA</i>, that the doctrine of
    estoppel could not override the applicable collective agreement and that, as a
    result, Jacobs had violated the principal agreement and was liable for damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated December 1, 2006, counsel for the IBEW asked the Board
    to provide “fuller reasons for its decision”.  Jacobs objected on the ground
    that the Board lacked jurisdiction to redraft its reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 1, 2007, the Board provided the second set of reasons - two
    and a half pages in length - in which six paragraphs were added to the first
    set of reasons.  In these reasons, the Board said that it had jurisdiction to
    expand upon its reasons.  It gave no authority in support of this position.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of a statutory tribunal such as the Board is entirely
    circumscribed by statute: <i>Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability
    Support Program)</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 513, at paras. 16, 27 and 47.  It follows
    that the statutory framework of the Board’s enabling statute, the <i>LRA,</i> governs the Board’s jurisdiction to issue further reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provision of the <i>LRA</i> states: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>114(1)  The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to
    exercise the powers conferred upon it by or under this Act and to determine all
    questions of fact or law that arise in any matter before it, and the action or
    decision of the Board thereon is final and conclusive for all purposes, but
    nevertheless the Board may at any time, if it considers it advisable to do so,
    reconsider any decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling made by it and
    vary or revoke any such decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s <i>Rules of Procedure</i> set out the process for making a
    request for reconsideration pursuant to s. 114(1); the required steps include completing
    the prescribed forms and filing complete written submissions with the Board
    within the prescribed time period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Board has adopted the following principles by which it
    is guided in determining whether to grant a reconsideration request.  The
    General Guidelines contained in the Ontario Labour Relations Board’s
    Information Bulletin No. 19 read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Generally, the Board will not reconsider its
    decision unless the requesting party has new evidence that would be practically
    conclusive of the case and <i>that it could not have reasonably obtained
    earlier</i>, or the party has <i>new</i> objections or arguments <i>that it had
    no opportunity to raise earlier</i>.   Because of the need for finality in
    labour relations matters, the Board does not treat its reconsideration power as
    either a tool for a party to repair the deficiency of its case nor as an
    opportunity to reargue it.  (See <i>John Entwistle Construction Limited</i>,
    [1979] OLRB Rep. Nov. 1096.)  If the requesting party relies on matters that
    could reasonably have been raised at the original hearing, the Board will
    normally not reconsider its decision [emphasis in original].</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      THE DECISION BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reasons dated June 4, 2008, the Divisional Court dismissed Jacob’s
    application for judicial review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court found the first set of reasons inadequate but held,
    at para. 48, that s. 114(1) of the <i>LRA</i> permits the Board to issue
    supplemental reasons, stating that the provision “is framed broadly, so as to
    ensure that the Board is not <i>functus</i> once it has issued a decision.”  The
    Divisional Court relied on<i> Re Canac Shock Absorbers Ltd. and International
    Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Workers of America</i> <i>(U.A.W.)</i>, <i>Local 984 </i>(1975), 5 O.R. (2d) 648, as support for the Board’s power to
    vary or clarify a decision.  It also noted that in <i>International Brotherhood
    of Electrical Workers, Local 1739 v. International Brotherhood of Electrical
    Workers</i> (2007)<i>,</i> 86 O.R. (3d) 508 (Div.Ct.) (“<i>IBEW 1739</i>”), the
    Divisional Court was critical of an applicant in a judicial review application
    who attacked the adequacy of the Board’s reasons without first asking the Board
    for further reasons or asking for a reconsideration pursuant to s. 114(1) of
    the <i>LRA</i>. The Divisional Court acknowledged, however, that the Board in <i>IBEW
    1739</i> had specifically reserved the power to issue further reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, at para. 50, the Divisional Court also provided a policy
    rationale in support of its decision, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From a policy perspective, it makes sense to permit
    the Board to issue supplemental reasons in a case like this, as the provision
    of such reasons may be sufficient to avoid the costs and delay associated with
    an application for judicial review. Here, the application for judicial review
    had not yet been launched at the time the Second Reasons were issued, and there
    is no apparent prejudice to the unsuccessful party because of the issuance of
    these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority went on to find the second set of reasons to be adequate and,
    after rejecting the other grounds upon which Jacobs relied, dismissed the
    application.  While Smith J. dissented in the result, he did agree that the Board
    had jurisdiction to issue supplemental reasons pursuant to s. 114(1) of the <i>LRA</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>V.        ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, Jacobs raises the following issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the Divisional Court erred in determining that the Board, in these
    circumstances, was entitled to issue supplementary reasons at the request of
    the successful party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the majority of the Divisional Court erred in finding that the second set of
    reasons was adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the Divisional Court erred in its determination of the standard of review with
    respect to the Board’s application of the doctrine of estoppel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the majority of the Divisional Court erred in determining that the Board’s
    application of the doctrine of estoppel was reasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given my conclusion that the Board did not have jurisdiction to issue the
    second set of reasons and the parties’ agreement that in such case the appeal
    ought to be allowed, it is only necessary for me to address the first issue.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>VI.      ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>As a preliminary matter, I start with the Board’s duty to

    requirement that an administrative tribunal provide reasons for its

    Employees Retirement System</i>, 2009 ONCA 670, Goudge J.A. referred to <i>Baker </i>in explaining the process whereby the content of the duty of procedural
    fairness may be determined, including the obligation, if any, to give reasons. 
    At para. 20 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…While acknowledging there may be other factors, <i>Baker</i> suggests five factors of relevance to determine the content of the duty of
    fairness: the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in
    making it; the nature of the statutory scheme being administered; the
    importance of the decision to the affected individual; the legitimate
    expectations of the person challenging the decision; and respect for the choice
    of procedures made by the administrative agency itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>In this case, the
    decision determined significant rights of the parties and there is a right to
    have the decision reviewed.  Furthermore, the process used was very much like a
    court process.  The Board, like the courts, has a body of jurisprudence,
    regularly refers back to its own decisions and has its own official reporter
    series.  In my view, it is therefore within the parties’ reasonable
    expectations that they will receive reasons.  These observations support the conclusion
    that the Board is obliged to provide reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But what of the Board’s jurisdiction to revisit its reasons?  This
    question introduces the concept of <i>functus officio</i>.  Guidance on the
    application of <i>functus</i> to administrative tribunals can be found in <i>Chandler
    v. Alberta Association of Architects</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848, where Sopinka J.
    said at p. 861 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a general rule, once [an administrative
    tribunal] has reached a final decision in respect of a matter that is before it
    in accordance with its enabling statute, that decision cannot be revisited
    because the tribunal has changed its mind, made an error within jurisdiction or
    because there has been a change of circumstances.  It can only do so if
    authorized by statute or if there has been a slip or error within the
    exceptions enunciated in <i>Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J.O. Ross Engineering Corp., </i>[1934] S.C.R. 186.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond clerical or mathematical errors, or an error in expressing the
    tribunal’s intention, <i>functus officio</i> generally applies except where
    varied by statute.  There is no suggestion in this case of a slip or error.  Therefore
    the Board’s jurisdiction to revisit its reasons must be through the
    authorization of the <i>LRA.</i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the IBEW and the Board, in arguing that the Board had jurisdiction
    to render the second set of reasons, rely, in various ways, on the
    interpretation they say should be given to s. 114(1) of the <i>LRA</i>, policy
    considerations and certain jurisprudence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1. <u>Statutory
    Construction</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly, s. 114(1), the section that deals directly with the Board’s
    authority to revisit reasons, is the governing provision. The Board points out
    that the section does not mention “reasons” specifically, but rather refers to
    “decisions, orders, directions, declarations, or rulings” and argues that the
    power to vary a decision must include the power to vary or supplement its
    reasons.  The term “decisions” in s. 114(1) must include the reasons for the
    decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed, I agree with this point but it takes me to a different
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the modern principles of statutory interpretation, “the
    words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the
    Act, and the intention of Parliament”: Elmer A. Driedger,<i> The Construction
    of Statutes</i>, (Toronto: Butterworths, 1974), at p. 67; <i>Re Rizzo &amp;
    Rizzo Shoes Ltd</i>., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As previously indicated, the <i>Baker</i> analysis leads me to conclude
    that reasons must accompany every Board decision.  In other words, the Board’s
    decisions must be reasoned decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Principles of statutory interpretation support the conclusion that in s.
    114(1) the word “decision” must include “reasons”.  The <i>LRA</i>, periodically
    refers to the filing of a decision “exclusive of the reasons therefor”: <i>LRA</i>,
    s. 48(19).  See also <i>LRA </i>ss. 96(6), 99(10), 102, 144(4), and 168(8).  This
    suggests that in all other sections where the word “decision” appears alone, it
    must be intended to include the reasons behind the decision.  It is a principle
    of interpretation that “[u]nless the contrary is clearly indicated by the
    context, a word should be given the same interpretation or meaning whenever it
    appears in an act:” <i>Thomson v. Canada (Deputy Minister of Agriculture)</i>,
    [1992] 1 S.C.R.385 at 400 (per Cory J., for the majority).  As a matter of
    interpretation, I conclude that an unqualified reference to a “decision” in the <i>LRA</i>, as in s. 114(1), includes the “reasons therefor”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore, in agreement with the submissions of the Board, start from
    the position that in the context of s. 114(1) of the <i>LRA</i>, the term
    decision means the decision and its reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Board and I part company on the consequences of this
    conclusion in terms of jurisdiction to revisit reasons in the absence of a
    request to reconsider the decision itself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The words of s. 114(1), read “in their grammatical and ordinary sense<span
lang=EN-US>”</span>, do not countenance the possibility that the Board has
    jurisdiction to issue supplementary reasons in circumstances where the decision
    is not in play.  The relevant portion states that “the Board may at any time,
    if it considers it advisable to do so, <i>reconsider</i> any decision, order,
    direction, declaration or ruling made by it <i>and</i> vary or revoke any such
    decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling”.  This section does not
    mention the power to augment reasons, expand upon reasons, or issue
    supplementary reasons.  Rather, the use of the conjunctive “and” indicates that
    any decision by the Board to “vary or revoke” one of its decisions will be as a
    result of its first having <i>reconsidered</i> the decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., “reconsider”
    means “consider again, [especially] for a possible change of decision.”  In
    plain language, it means putting the result in play.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the IBEW did not ask the Board to reconsider its decision; indeed,
    a request for reconsideration emanating from the IBEW would be more than
    passing strange since it was successful before the Board. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<u> Policy
    Considerations</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same conclusion is reached by considering the policy behind s.
    114(1). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of the <i>LRA</i> sets out the objects of the <i>LRA</i>. It
    reads:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>2.  The
    following are the purposes of the Act:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>1. To facilitate collective bargaining
    between employers and trade unions that is the freely-designated
    representatives of the employees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    workplace parties adapting to change.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    economic growth as the foundation for mutually beneficial relations amongst
    employers, employees and trade unions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

line-height:normal'>6. To encourage co-operative
    participation of employers and trade unions in resolving workplace issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>7. To promote the expeditious resolution of workplace
    disputes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 114(1) seems designed to achieve the last of these objects;
    namely, to promote the expeditious resolution of workplace disputes.  This
    particular objective stems from the nature of the relationship between the
    parties: unions and employers must be able to continue to work together despite
    any disputes that may arise: see <i>IBEW</i> <i>1739</i> at paras. 15-17. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A common argument in favour of allowing an agency to reconsider its
    decision is that it is more time and cost effective to allow a tribunal to
    correct its own error rather than wait for a court to order it to correct the
    error following a judicial review: Macaulay and Sprague, <i>Practice and
    Procedure before Administrative Tribunals</i>, looseleaf, vol. 3 (Toronto:
    Thomson Canada Limited, 2004), at p. 27A-2. As previously mentioned, the
    Divisional Court relied upon this policy rationale in its reasons supporting
    the Board’s actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument is convincing insofar as it provides normative support for
    a tribunal’s reconsideration power.  However, I am not persuaded by this
    rationale in the circumstances here where the Board has issued reasons that are <i>prima facie</i> final and the successful party has requested that the Board augment
    those reasons.  Allowing the Board to provide “fuller” reasons does not promote
    efficiency and timeliness; rather, it does the opposite.  When a tribunal does
    not announce that further reasons are to come, it is fair for the parties to
    assume that the reasons issued are final and to arrange their affairs
    accordingly, including deciding whether and on what grounds to seek judicial
    review.  Leaving a decision open to supplementary reasons invites the
    unnecessary consumption of resources and avoids finality - consequences that
    are hardly consistent with the objective of the expeditious resolution of
    workplace disputes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, supplementary reasons run the risk of giving the appearance
    of the Board’s attempting to “cooper up” the decision: see Donald J.M. Brown, <i>Civil
    Appeals</i>, vol. 2, looseleaf (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing, 2009), at pp.
    13-31 to 13-32; see also <i>Kowalski v. Royal Ford Lincoln Mercury Sales Ltd.
    (c.o.b. Royal Ford Lincoln Mercury)</i> (1993), 116 Sask. R. 73, at para. 14. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The consequences of such a perception have been considered in <i>R. v.
    Teskey</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 267, at para. 18 where the majority held that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Reasons rendered long after a verdict, particularly
    where it is apparent that they were entirely crafted after the announcement of
    the verdict, may cause a reasonable person to apprehend that the trial judge
    may not have reviewed and considered the evidence with an open mind as he or
    she is duty-bound to do but, rather, that the judge has engaged in
    result-driven reasoning.  In other words, having already announced the verdict,
    particularly a verdict of guilt, a question arises whether the post-decision
    review and analysis of the evidence was done, even subconsciously, with the
    view of defending the verdict rather than arriving at it…. Further, if an
    appeal from the verdict has been launched, as here, and the reasons deal with
    certain issues raised on appeal, this may create the appearance that the trial
    judge is advocating a particular result rather than articulating the reasons
    that led him or her to the decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While <i>Teskey</i> is a criminal case, the rationale applies here. When
    an adjudicator purports to issue the final reasons for a decision and later
    issues supplementary reasons, without explaining why the supplementary reasons
    did not form part of the initial reasons, a reasonable person may apprehend
    that the adjudicator engaged in results-based reasoning in order to shore up
    the decision.  If the adjudicator had relied on the content of the
    supplementary reasons in arriving at the decision, those reasons should have
    formed part of the first set of reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, and in my view, significantly, interpreting the <i>LRA</i> so
    as to prevent the provision of revised reasons in these circumstances
    encourages focused decision-making that is clearly and fully explained at the
    outset.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.<u> Jurisprudence relating to <i>functus officio</i></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the jurisprudence upon which the IBEW relies to overcome the
    application of <i>functus</i> does not support its arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the Divisional Court and the IBEW cite <i>Re Canac Shock Absorbers</i> and <i>IBEW 1739 </i>as supporting the conclusion that the Board has the power to
    provide supplementary, clarifying reasons despite the doctrine of <i>functus
    officio.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Re Canac Shock Absorbers</i>, the Board initially decided that the
    two corporate entities in question must be treated as one employer for the
    purposes of the <i>LRA</i>.  The parties disagreed about the effect of this
    decision.  The union applied to the Board, requesting clarification.  After
    hearing submissions from the parties on the issue, the Board agreed to clarify
    the decision pursuant to its powers under then section 95(1) of the <i>LRA</i>,
    which is identical to the current s. 114(1).  Although the traditional
    prerequisites for the Board to exercise its reconsideration power were not met,
    the Board granted the request for two reasons.  First, the proceedings had
    already been protracted, and it would be preferable to avoid the multiplicity
    of proceedings that would result from attempting to implement the decision in
    accordance with the union’s interpretation.  Second, at the time, the issue was
    a “matter of virtually first instance” and as a result there was a dearth of
    precedent to guide any tribunal that might be required to interpret the Board’s
    decision.  As a clarification, the Board added one sentence to its reasons,
    explaining the effect of its decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court concluded that regardless of whether the Board’s
    alteration was a variation or a clarification, the Board did not exceed its
    jurisdiction, since s. 91(12) (now s. 110(16)) gives the Board the power to
    determine its own practice and procedure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the clarification of the decision in <i>Re Canac Shock
    Absorbers</i> resulted from ambiguity, not insufficiency.  <span lang=EN-US>Macaulay
    and Sprague treat ambiguities and clarifications as inseparable from the common
    law exception to<i> functus</i> of “clerical error, accidental slip or
    omission” on the grounds that “one assumes that the decision-maker did not want
    to be ambiguous”: p. 27A-34.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>IBEW 1739</i> the Divisional Court was critical of an applicant in
    a judicial review application who attacked the adequacy of the Board’s reasons
    without first asking the Board for further reasons or asking for a
    reconsideration pursuant to s. 114(1).  In that case, the Board had issued
    brief written reasons and stated that further reasons might follow.  The Vice
    Chair also noted that he &quot;remained seized to deal with any difficulties in
    implementing this award&quot;: para. 33.  The union then sought judicial review
    on the basis of, among other things, insufficiency of reasons.  The Divisional
    Court noted that in the interests of achieving its labour relations objectives,
    the Board is often required to give “bottom line” decisions and to release
    reasons quickly after expedited proceedings.  The court also noted that “where
    one of the parties is unsatisfied with either the result or the reasoning, it
    has a legislated right to ask for reconsideration as expressly contemplated in
    s. 114(1) of the Act.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision in <i>IBEW 1739</i> is of no assistance for the simple reason
    that in the instant case the Board did not remain seized to give further
    reasons.  When an arbitrator or tribunal remains seized of an issue, the
    doctrine of <i>functus officio</i>, by definition, does not apply.  <i>Black’s
    Law Dictionary</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed., defines “functus officio” as being
    “without further authority or legal competence because the duties and functions
    of the original commission have been fully accomplished”.   Retaining
    jurisdiction over an aspect of a case is generally acceptable only where that
    aspect has not been fully addressed; a tribunal cannot arbitrarily reserve for
    itself extended jurisdiction over a completed aspect of a case.  It is
    important to note that the inquiry as to when a tribunal has completed its
    commission must be contextual: “[t]he nature of the mandate of an agency is
    important in determining whether an agency has the authority to reserve
    jurisdiction on a matter in issuing a decision:” Macaulay and Sprague, at p.
    27A-36.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>IBEW 1739</i>, the immediate need for a resolution necessitated an
    expedited procedure and prompted the Vice-Chair to reserve jurisdiction to
    provide fuller reasons in the future.  In this case, jurisdiction to revisit
    the reasons was neither reserved nor warranted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While, in my view, <i>Re Canac Shock Absorbers</i> and <i>IBEW 1739</i> can be distinguished on these grounds, I would add that to the extent that they
    can be interpreted as standing for the proposition that the Board’s
    jurisdiction to determine its own practice and procedure is expansive enough to
    allow it to clarify previous decisions, they were wrongly decided.  The power
    to control a tribunal’s own procedure does not extend to post-judgment jurisdiction. 
    Indeed, the Divisional Court, in <i>Borough of Etobicoke v. Etobicoke
    Professional Firefighters Association Local 1137 et. al.</i> (1982), 37 O.R.
    (2d) 212 (Div. Ct.) cautioned against labour arbitrators reserving to
    themselves powers that were not clearly provided for within the relevant
    statutory scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the other cases relied upon by the respondents are germane to
    the case at bar in that they do not touch on whether “reconsideration” is broad
    enough to include the power to revisit the reasons separate from the decision
    itself.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>VII.     CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The text of s. 114(1) allows the Board to reconsider “any decision,
    order, direction, declaration or ruling”.  In my view, this means the Board has
    the power to reconsider the merits of its decision, upon receiving full
    submissions from the parties, in accordance with its <i>Rules of Procedure</i>. 
    There is no provision in the <i>LRA</i> that gives the Board the power to do
    what it did in this instance, namely, issue supplementary reasons designed to
    repair deficiencies in an earlier set of reasons.  If the Board was to have such
    jurisdiction, the statute would have made it clear.  Therefore, the common law
    doctrine of <i>functus</i> applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I cannot accept that the Board has the power to rewrite its
    reasons in the absence of a reconsideration on any other basis.  Such a
    conclusion would introduce an element of unfairness to the system. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, jurisdiction to re-write reasons in circumstances such as these
    would expose the losing party to new reasons without access to the procedural
    protections provided in the Board’s <i>Rules of Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it would create a problem of uncertainty. If the Board were to
    have ongoing authority to augment its reasons, the parties would never know
    when the reasons actually become final.  After the second set of reasons? 
    After the third?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it would allow for manipulation of the decision that is being
    judicially reviewed.  If the reasons are inadequate, the parties will always be
    at odds over what reasons ought to be reviewed.  The unsuccessful party will
    want them to remain unchanged so it can argue inadequate reasons on the judicial
    review.  The successful party will seek to have the reasons rewritten.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I return where I began – with the observation that the Board is a
    creature of statute.  While tribunals may be entitled to exercise certain powers
    to fill in gaps left by the legislators that are necessary to fulfill their
    mandate, that is not what happened in this case.  S. 114(1) specifically
    addresses the issue of further reasons.  Its wording and clear parameters,
    together with the Board’s <i>Rules of Procedure</i>, address the policy issues
    upon which the IBEW relies and provides fairness to all parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the IBEW did not seek further reasons under s. 114 (1) for obvious
    reasons.  That section, as I have said, provides for a reconsideration, a
    process that brings the result into play – something a successful party such as
    the respondent is not likely to want.  IBEW wanted the Board to improve upon its
    reasons - favourable in the result but deficient in their content - to immunize
    them from review.  That is neither provided for by the <i>LRA,</i> nor fair.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>VIII.   DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Jacobs has been denied procedural fairness, I would allow the appeal

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Epstein
    J.A. I agree with my colleague’s conclusion that Jacobs Catalytic Ltd. was
    denied procedural fairness because of the failure of a panel of the Ontario
    Labour Relations Board to deliver adequate reasons. Accordingly, I too would
    allow the appeal and send the matter back for a new hearing before a
    differently constituted Board. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I reach this conclusion for somewhat different reasons than my
    colleague, which I will try to explain briefly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like my colleague, I would accept Jacobs’ submission that the
    reconsideration power contained in s. 114 of the <i>Labour Relations Act, 1995</i>,
    S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A, (<i>LRA</i>), does not give the Board express
    statutory authority to deliver supplementary reasons for a prior decision that
    has not been reconsidered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my view, the absence of express statutory authority does not
    mean that the Board lacked jurisdiction to deliver supplementary reasons. As I
    see it, the Board’s authority to deliver reasons, whether original or
    supplementary, is ancillary to its power to make decisions and determinations,
    and does not require explicit statutory authority. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I am not persuaded, for several reasons, that the <i>functus
    officio</i> doctrine deprived the Board of jurisdiction to deliver
    supplementary reasons. Rather than a jurisdictional issue, in my opinion, the
    question of whether the supplementary reasons should be considered on a
    judicial review application is a fairness issue and is governed by the
    principle set out in<i> R. v. Teskey</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 267.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the <i>Teskey</i> principle, I conclude that the Board’s
    supplementary reasons should not have been considered on the judicial review
    application and that a new hearing is required because of the inadequacy of the
    Board’s first set of reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. Background        </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree generally with my colleague’s summary of the facts and with her
    description of the decision of the Divisional Court. Accordingly, I will refer
    to these matters only briefly to put my reasons in context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As my colleague has explained, the proceeding before the Board arose out
    of a grievance by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
    concerning which of two collective agreements governed wage rates to be paid
    for fire restoration work performed at a Petro-Canada plant. Following a
    lengthy hearing, the Board issued a two-page decision on November 15, 2006 in
    which it upheld the union’s grievance. Later, on February 1, 2007, and in
    response to a request from the union for more fulsome reasons, the Board
    delivered redrafted and somewhat amplified reasons consisting of about
    two-and-a-half pages in which it arrived at the same result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On an application for judicial review brought by the employer (Jacobs),
    the majority of the Divisional Court agreed that the Board’s first set of
    reasons was inadequate but concluded that the supplementary reasons were
    adequate and dismissed the remaining grounds for judicial review. In doing so,
    the majority held that s. 114 of the <i>LRA</i> provided the Board with
    authority to issue supplementary reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, all parties agree that the Board’s first set of reasons was
    inadequate. I, too, agree, essentially for the reasons expressed by the
    majority of the Divisional Court. However, in this court, Jacobs, supported by
    the General Presidents’ Maintenance Committee, renews its preliminary objection
    that the Board lacked jurisdiction to issue supplementary reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, Jacobs contends that the reconsideration provision contained
    in s. 114 of the <i>LRA</i> does not empower the Board to issue supplementary
    reasons where it has not reconsidered a prior decision and that, absent
    authority under that provision, the Board lacked jurisdiction to issue
    supplementary reasons because it was <i>functus</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>III. Discussion of
    Issues</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

    to Deliver Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, I agree that the reconsideration power contained in s.
    114 of the<i> LRA</i> does not provide the Board with express statutory authority
    to deliver supplementary reasons for a prior decision that has not been
    reconsidered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 114 of the<i> LRA </i>is an expansive provision that describes
    the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction and the final nature of its decisions. In
    addition, it gives the Board broad statutory authority to reconsider its
    decisions. The reconsideration provision empowers the Board to “reconsider any
    decision” and to “vary or revoke any such decision”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a
name=BK132></a>114. (1) The Board has <i>exclusive jurisdiction</i> to exercise
    the powers conferred upon it by or under this Act and <i>to determine all
    questions of fact or law that arise</i> in any matter before it, and <i>the
    action or decision of the Board thereon is final</i> and conclusive for all
    purposes, <i>but nevertheless the Board may</i> at any time, if it considers it
    advisable to do so, <i>reconsider any decision</i>, order, direction,
    declaration or ruling made by it <i>and vary or revoke any such decision</i>,
    order, direction, declaration or ruling. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reconsideration power contained in s. 114 makes no reference to
    issuing reasons, or supplementary reasons, for a decision made previously. On a
    plain reading of the provision, it applies only where the Board is asked, or is
    contemplating, changing a prior decision in some respect. As was noted by my colleague,
    the IBEW in this case specifically did not ask the Board to reconsider its
    decision. It was successful before the Board; why would it do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my view, the absence of express statutory authority to issue
    supplementary reasons does not mean the Board lacked jurisdiction to issue
    them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no express statutory authority for the Board to deliver its
    original reasons in this case; yet no one questions that the Board had
    jurisdiction to do so. Similarly, there is no express statutory authority for
    the Board to reserve the right to deliver supplementary reasons. Again, no one
    questions that it can do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the power of a tribunal to give reasons, or supplementary
    reasons, is ancillary to its jurisdiction to give a decision. Moreover, in a
    labour relations matter such as this one, the power to give reasons is
    reinforced by the common law duty to give adequate reasons: see<i> Baker v.
    Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; and <i>Via
    Rail Inc. v. National Transportation Agency</i>, [2001] 2 F.C. 25 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, I see no basis for holding that express statutory authority
    is required to permit the delivery of supplementary reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Doctrine of <i>Functus Officio</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next question is whether the doctrine of <i>functus officio </i>applies
    so as to preclude the delivery of supplementary reasons in this case. In my
    view, it does not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is helpful to begin the discussion of the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine with reference to the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Chandler v.
    Alberta Association of Architects</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848, at p. 680, where
    Sopinka J. set out the essential elements of the doctrine as well as its
    exceptions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The general rule that a final decision of a court
    cannot be reopened derives from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>In
    re St. Nazaire Co</i>. (1879), 12 Ch. D. 88. The basis for it was that <i>the
    power to rehear was transferred by the Judicature Acts to the appellate
    division</i>. The <i>rule applied only after the formal judgment had been drawn
    up, issued and entered</i>, and <i>was subject to two exceptions</i>:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1. where there had been <i>a slip in drawing it
    up</i>, and,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2. where <i>there was an error in expressing
    the manifest intention of the court</i>. See <i>Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J. O.
    Ross Engineering Corp.</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 186. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, at least three questions arise from this statement of the rule.
    First, given that the rule arose in civil cases, at what point does the
    presiding officer become <i>functus</i> in other types of cases?<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Second, does the rule apply to reasons for decision as well as to decisions?
    Third, what is covered by the two exceptions?<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt because of the need to address the substantive issues on
    appeal, the parties did not address these questions in any detail. In my view,
    the answers to the first and second of these questions are particularly
    important to this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Chandler</i> provides assistance with both questions. After
    explaining the general rule and its exceptions, Sopinka J. discussed the
    application of <i>functus officio</i> in the administrative law context at pp.
    860-61. Although what follows below are some rather lengthy quotations, in my
    view, they are significant because they make three important points. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, provisions such as s. 114 of the <i>LRA</i> are designed to avoid
    the application of the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine where the legislature
    deems that appropriate in the context of the work of the particular
    administrative tribunal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Grillas v. Minister of Manpower and
    Immigration</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 577, Martland J. speaking for himself and Laskin
    J. <i>opined that the same reasoning did not apply to the Immigration Appeal
    Board from which there was no appeal except on a question of law</i>....:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>The same reasoning does not apply to the
    decisions of the Board, from which there is no appeal, save on a question of
    law. There is no appeal by way of a rehearing.</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>In <i>R. v. Development Appeal Board, Ex p.
    Canadian Industries Ltd.</i>, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
    Alberta<i> was of the view that the Alberta Legislature had recognized the application
    of the restriction stated in the St. Nazaire Company case to administrative
    boards in that express provision for rehearing was made in the statutes </i>creating
    some provincial boards, whereas, <i>in the case of the Development Appeal Board
    in question, no such provision had been made</i>. <i>The Court goes on to note
    that one of the purposes in setting up these boards is to provide speedy
    determination of administrative problems</i>.  [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the mischief at which the <i>functus officio </i>doctrine is primarily
    directed is the subsequent reconsideration of a decision that has already been
    made. Sopinka J. explained this in a passage immediately following the
    quotation set out above:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not understand Martland J. to go so far as to
    hold that <i>functus officio</i> has no application to administrative
    tribunals. Apart from the English practice which is based on a reluctance to
    amend or reopen formal judgments, there is a sound policy reason for
    recognizing the finality of proceedings before administrative tribunals. <i>As
    a general rule, once such a tribunal has reached a final decision</i> in
    respect to the matter that is before it in accordance with its enabling statute <i>that decision cannot be revisited because the tribunal has changed its mind,
    made an error within jurisdiction or because there has been a change of
    circumstances</i>. <i>It can only do so if authorized by statute or if</i> there has been a slip or error within the exceptions enunciated in the <i>Paper
    Machinery Ltd. v. J. O. Ross Engineering Corp.</i>, <i>supra</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, in relation to administrative tribunals, the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine should be applied in a flexible way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To this extent, the principle of <i>functus officio</i> applies. It is <i>based, however, on the policy ground which favours finality</i> of proceedings rather than the rule which was developed with respect to formal
    judgments of a court whose decision was subject to a full appeal. For this
    reason, I am of the opinion that <i>its application must be more flexible and
    less formalistic in respect to the decisions of administrative tribunals which
    are subject to appeal only on a point of law</i>. Justice may require the
    reopening of administrative proceedings in order to provide relief which would
    otherwise be available on appeal. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, <i>the principle should not be
    strictly applied where there are indications in the enabling statute that a
    decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the
    function committed to it by enabling legislation</i>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Furthermore, <i>if the tribunal has failed to dispose
    of an issue which is fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the tribunal
    is empowered by its enabling statute to dispose, it ought to be allowed to
    complete its statutory task</i>. If, however, the administrative entity is
    allowed to dispose of a matter by one or more specified remedies or by
    alternative remedies, the fact one is selected does not entitle it to reopen
    proceedings to make another or further selection. Nor will reserving the right
    to do so preserve the continuing jurisdiction of the tribunal unless a power to
    make provisional or interim orders has been conferred on it by statute.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the quotations from <i>Chandler</i>, suggest that the
    finality concerns that underlie the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine do not
    support restricting a tribunal from issuing supplementary reasons, at least
    where the tribunal has a reconsideration power. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<i> Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3,
    at para. 79, Iacobucci and Arbour JJ. highlighted the importance of the<i> functus officio</i> doctrine in promoting finality of judgments in order to set
    the stage for appeals:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that the principle of functus officio
    exists to allow finality of judgments from courts which are subject to appeal
    (see also Reekie v. Messervey, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 219, at pp. 222-23). This makes
    sense: <i>if the court could continually hear applications to vary its
    decisions, it would assume the function of an appellate court and deny
    litigants a stable base from which to launch an appeal</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    where the Legislature has seen fit to give an administrative tribunal a
    reconsideration power, the existence of that power signals that other
    considerations trump the importance of finality in relation to the work of the
    tribunal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    as was explained by the majority of the Divisional Court at para. 50 of their
    reasons, concerns about efficiency and expense justify permitting the Board to
    deliver supplementary reasons where there is no prejudice to the parties:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From a policy perspective, it makes sense to permit
    the Board to issue supplemental reasons in a case like this, as the provision
    of such reasons may be sufficient to avoid the costs and delay associated with
    an application for judicial review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it is undoubtedly generally desirable that reasons be given before an appeal or
    application for judicial review is launched, unlike the absence of a decision,
    neither the absence of reasons nor the delivery of supplementary reasons create
    insurmountable problems to rights of appeal or judicial review. If that were
    not so, courts and tribunals would not have the power to reserve the right to
    deliver reasons at the time of giving a decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that
    regard, it is clear that the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine does not restrict
    the right to reserve the power to give reasons, or further reasons, after a
    decision is rendered and an appeal is launched: see <i>R. v. Teskey</i>, [2007]
    2 S.C.R. 267<i>.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Teskey</i>,
    the trial judge reserved the right to give written reasons after finding the accused
    guilty. Although Charron J., speaking for the majority, held that the written
    reasons should not be considered on appeal in the particular circumstances of
    that case, she acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary for a court to
    deliver reasons for a decision after the decision was made and did not question
    the power of a court to reserve the right to do so. I see no reason why this
    principle should not apply to an administrative tribunal such as the Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the <i>functus</i> <i>officio</i> doctrine does not restrict the right to reserve the power to
    give reasons after a decision is rendered and even after an appeal is launched,
    I fail to see what policy considerations justify interpreting the doctrine to
    deprive a tribunal that has a reconsideration power of jurisdiction to issue
    supplementary reasons just because the tribunal did not explicitly reserve the
    right to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    the result in <i>Teskey</i> makes it clear that appellate courts are
    well-positioned to guard against the risks associated with after-the-fact
    reasons without the need to apply the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    opinion, the <i>Teskey</i> principle is a preferable tool for assessing whether
    supplementary reasons should be considered on judicial review as compared to
    the blunt instrument of a bright-line application of the <i>functus</i> <i>officio</i> doctrine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to
    the quotation from <i>Chandler</i> set out<i> </i>at paragraph 25, I note that
    Sopinka J.’s comments are directed at the issue of reconsideration, they do not
    address the delivery of reasons or supplementary reasons. Accordingly, I
    question whether the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine even applies to
    supplementary reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this
    regard, it is important to remember that, just as there is a distinction
    between a court’s reasons for judgment and its judgment, there is a distinction
    between a tribunal’s decision and its reasons for decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    view, s. 17(1) of the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.
    22, makes it clear that there is a distinction between a decision and the
    reasons for a decision in an administrative law context. More importantly, s.
    17(1) demonstrates that the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine may not be in play. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    17(1) of the <i>SPPA</i> requires that “[a] tribunal ... give its final
    decision ... in writing”; and also that the tribunal “give reasons in writing
    therefor if requested by a party.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain
    reading of s. 17, there is a distinction between the decision of a tribunal and
    the tribunal’s reasons for its decision. Accordingly, even if it is the
    practice of the Board to issue its decision or order and its reasons for the
    decision in the same document, it is necessary and important to distinguish
    between the two. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    although a party may obviously request reasons in advance, s. 17(1) appears to
    contemplate reasons being given after the fact. Section 17(1) places no
    restrictions on a party’s right to request reasons after a decision is made. As
    a matter of common sense, one would think that would be the more frequent use
    of this section. But obviously, an after-the-fact request would not be possible
    if the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine precludes absolutely the delivery of
    reasons after a decision has been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    given the result in <i>Chandler</i>, I question whether the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine prevents a tribunal that has delivered inadequate reasons from
    delivering supplementary reasons in any event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Chandler</i>,
    the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by making findings and issuing orders it
    was not authorized to make. The Supreme Court of Canada held the tribunal was entitled
    to continue the original proceedings in order to fulfill its proper function
    but on terms that the parties could call further evidence and make further
    submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    where a tribunal fails to fulfill its common law obligation to deliver adequate
    reasons, why would it be precluded, under the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine,
    from completing its proper function?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now
    to the appropriateness of considering the Board’s supplementary reasons on the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I
    am not persuaded that the Board required express statutory authority to issue
    supplementary reasons in this case and although I am not persuaded that the <i>functus</i> doctrine precludes them, I nonetheless conclude that the circumstances under
    which those reasons were issued raise a concern that they may be the product of
    result-oriented, after-the-fact reasoning. For that reason, the supplementary
    reasons should not have been considered on the judicial review application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In<i> Teskey, </i>the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that written
    reasons for decision delivered more than 11 months after guilty verdicts were
    entered by the trial judge should not have been considered on appeal. They
    reached this conclusion because of the following factors, which demonstrated
    that a reasonable person would apprehend that the reasons constituted
    after-the-fact justification for the verdicts already delivered rather than an
    articulation of the reasons that led to the verdict:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>as evidenced by several adjournments of the decision date, the
    trial judge had obvious difficulty in arriving at a verdict in the months
    following the completion of the evidence;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in his oral reasons, the trial judge made a “bare declaration of
    guilt without any indication of the underlying reasoning”;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>after concluding, in error, that he had overlooked affording the
    accused a right of allocution, the trial judge expressed willingness to
    reconsider the verdicts immediately after their announcement;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>by its nature, the evidence in the case called for a detailed

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge failed to respond to repeated requests for his

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    perhaps not as egregious, in my view, several features of this case are
    sufficient to demonstrate that a reasonable person would believe that the
    Board’s supplementary reasons reflect after-the-fact result driven reasons
    rather than a true reflection of the reasoning process that led to the Board’s
    decision:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Board’s first set of reasons is conclusory and insufficient
    to meet the standard of adequate reasons;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>at the time of delivering its first set of reasons, the Board
    gave no indication of an intention to deliver supplementary reasons;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Board’s supplementary reasons, consisting of only
    two-and-a-half pages and very few entirely new paragraphs, was delivered two
    months after the request for more fulsome reasons;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in the words of the majority of the Divisional Court, the Board’s
    supplementary reasons are “far from the thorough and careful reasons that are
    generally issued by members of this Board”—indeed, in my view, if the Board’s
    supplementary reasons do meet the test of adequacy they just get over the line;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Board’s supplementary reasons provide no explanation of why
    the Board considered it necessary or appropriate to issue supplementary
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly
    because of the inadequacy of the Board’s first set of reasons and the Board’s
    failure to reserve the right to deliver additional reasons, an explanation was
    required to assuage concerns that the supplementary reasons were the product of
    a result-driven, after-the-fact justification process.  In the absence of an
    explanation and taking account of all the circumstances, I conclude that the
    Board’s supplementary reasons should not have been considered on the judicial
    review application.</p>

    not be corrected after the jury was discharged. In <i>R. v. Burke</i>, [2002] 2
    S.C.R. 857, the Supreme Court of Canada relaxed this rule where the error to be
    corrected does not require the jury to reconsider its verdicts or continue its
    deliberations and where an inquiry fails to disclose any reasonable
    apprehension of bias (or taint). At para. 48, Major J., speaking for the
    majority, said “the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute
    by barring the court from correcting a recorded verdict where there is no
    perceptible injustice to the accused and no reasonable apprehension of bias.” A
    similar approach was adopted by this court in <i>R. v. Malicia</i> (2006), 82
    O.R. (3d) 772, a criminal jury case in which a correction made after the trial
    judge had endorsed the indictment.</p>
