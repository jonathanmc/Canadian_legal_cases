  <h4 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US> Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals the decision of Trotter J.
    granting summary judgment to the Bank on a demand guarantee. The only issue on
    the motion and on the appeal was whether the claim was commenced beyond the two
    year limitation period under s. 4 of the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, an officer, director and shareholder of
    Ancon Industries Inc., gave the Bank a written guarantee of Ancon’s debts to
    the Bank up to a limit of $350,000. When Ancon defaulted on its loans in
    October 2004, the Bank wrote Ancon a demand letter on October 20, 2004 and on
    the same date sent the appellant a letter which stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>According to our records, as of October 20, 2004,
    the Borrower is obligated to us for direct advances (except letters of credit)
    in the principal amount of Cdn. $2,770,666.78, for interest in the amount of
    $15,460.11 and under a letter of credit in the amount of $6,000.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We hold your Guarantee dated December 20, 2002 of
    payment of the Obligations of the Borrower to the Bank.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We have today demanded payment of the Borrower’s
    obligations to us.&nbsp; A copy of our demand is enclosed.&nbsp; <b><i>If
    payment of our demand is not made as required, we will take steps to recover
    payment from you.</i></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 2, 2004, a Receiver of Ancon’s assets was
    appointed and on December 10, 2004, Ancon was deemed bankrupt. After the final
    assets were realized and the Receiver was discharged by order dated February 7,
    2007, Ancon still owed over $1 million to the Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank demanded payment from the appellant on the
    guarantee by a letter from the Bank’s counsel, dated June 12, 2007. That letter
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>According to the Bank’s records, [Ancon] is
    indebted to the Bank in the amount of $166,201.68.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Bank holds your guarantee dated 20 December
    2002 of payment of the obligations of the Borrower to the Bank, limited to the
    sum of $350,000.&nbsp; The guarantee is payable on demand and bears interest
    from the date of demand for payment at the Bank’s prime rate applicable at the
    time of demand plus 2% per annum.&nbsp; The Bank’s current prime rate is 6% per
    annum.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b><i>On Behalf of the Bank, we hereby demand
    payment from you under the said guarantee.</i></b> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant did not pay, the Bank commenced this
    action on July 7, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argued that the limitation period under
    s.5 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> commenced not when demand was made under the guarantee but when the Bank first discovered
    that Ancon, the principal debtor, would not be able to pay the full debt. Alternatively,
    if demand was required for a cause of action to arise and trigger the running
    of the limitation period, the appellant’s position was that the October 20,
    2004 letter (the first letter) to the Bank constituted a demand for payment. On
    either argument, the appellant submits that the two-year limitation period has expired.
     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank’s position was that under a demand guarantee,
    no cause of action arises until demand has been made on the guarantor. The
    first letter was not a demand, but merely a courtesy notice to the guarantor that
    if the principal debtor did not pay, then the Bank would look to the guarantor
    for payment. The Bank’s lawyer wrote what was clearly a demand letter to the
    guarantor on June 12, 2007 (the second letter), following the completion of the
    bankruptcy proceedings of the principal debtor that left the Bank with over $1
    million in outstanding debt. The Bank then commenced a timely action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge rejected the legal argument made by
    the appellant that under the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>, the limitation period on a demand guarantee commenced not on the
    date of demand but on the date when the Bank knew that the principal debtor was
    insolvent and that the debtor would not be paying the Bank. He found that no
    cause of action arose on the guarantee until the Bank had made demand on the
    guarantor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also concluded that the first letter
    did not constitute a demand on the guarantor. He compared the wording of the
    two letters and found that while the second letter actually demanded payment
    from the guarantor, the first was conditional, saying that if the principal
    debtor did not pay, then the Bank would take steps to collect from the
    guarantor. The motion judge also referred to the evidence of the Bank representative
    that the first letter was intended as a courtesy and he noted that there was no
    evidence from the appellant that he believed the first letter constituted a
    formal demand on him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the motion judge erred in
    both respects.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does a demand guarantee require a demand before it is
    enforceable?</p>
  <p>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does s.5 of the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002 </i>change the date for the commencement of the limitation period
    from the date of demand to the date when the Bank knew or ought to have known
    that the principal debtor was not going to pay?</p>
  <p>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Bank`s first letter constitute a demand on the
    guarantor? </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1:  Does a
    demand guarantee require a demand before it is enforceable?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A document that states it is payable “on demand” does
    not always require a demand before it can be enforced. It depends on the nature
    of the obligation and the construction of the document. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A promissory note that is payable “on demand” is in
    fact payable from the moment the money is loaned because the debt is owed from
    that moment: <i>Hare v. Hare</i> (2006), 83 O.R.
    (3d) 766 (C.A.), at para. 11. Therefore, it has been held that the words “on
    demand” add nothing to the obligation. The same rule applies to a demand
    mortgage: <i>Mortgage Insurance Company of
    Canada v. Grant</i>, 2009 ONCA 655, at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the courts have long held that this rule does
    not apply to a collateral obligation such as a guarantee or collateral mortgage
    given by a third party to secure the debt obligation of the primary debtor.
    Where the obligation of a third party guarantor is to pay on demand, then
    demand is a condition precedent to that obligation. The rationale is that where
    the guarantee obligation is made on demand, the third party guarantor is given
    an opportunity to marshal the funds before the obligation is due: <i>In re Brown’s Estate</i>, [1893] 2 Ch. 300,
    at pp. 304-305.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of the need for a demand has traditionally
    arisen in the context of a claim by a third party guarantor that an action on the
    guarantee was statute barred because the action was commenced more than six
    years (the former limitation period) after the principal debt was due. However,
    where a demand is a condition of the guarantee obligation, the time for
    commencing an action does not begin to run until a demand is made: see <i>Bradford Old Bank v. Sutcliffe</i>, [1918] 2
    K.B. 833; <i>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
    v. Sayani </i>(1994), 100 B.C.L.R. (2d) 294; McGuinness, <i>The Law of Guarantee</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1996)
    at para. 6.26.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relied both in the motion and in this
    appeal on the Superior Court decision in <i>2015673
    Ontario Inc. v. Chorny</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 207, where it was held that the
    limitation period on a guarantee ran not from the date of demand but from the
    date of default on the principal debt. However, that case is distinguishable because,
    although demand was made, there is nothing in the recitation of the facts that
    indicates that the terms of the guarantees required a demand.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 2:  Does s. 5 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002 </i>change the date for the commencement of the
    limitation period from the date of demand to the date when the Bank knew or
    ought to have known that the principal debtor was not going to pay?</span></h4>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hare v. Hare</i>,
    this court held that the <i>Limitations Act
    2002</i> does not, nor was it intended to change the common law with respect to
    the operation of demand promissory notes. The same applies to the common law
    regarding demand guarantees. As discussed above, a demand is required before
    anything is owed by a guarantor under a third party guarantee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits, as he did to the motion judge,
    that by requiring a demand as a condition of the existence of a cause of action
    and therefore the commencement of the limitation period, the court is promoting
    indefinite liability. However, as Trotter J. observed, that had always been the
    accepted effect under the former <i>Limitations
    Act</i> of obligations that required a demand in order to be enforceable.
    Furthermore, the appellant could have bargained for a different result. Also,
    section 15 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> imposes a 15 year ultimate limitation period so that liability will not be indefinite.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i> was amended on November 27, 2008 to add ss. 5(3) and (4), which
    deal specifically with the requirement for the commencement of the limitation
    period for demand obligations.  Those
    sections provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Demand Obligations</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>5.(3)  For
    the purposes of subclause (1)(a)(i), the day on which injury, loss or damage
    occurs in relation to a demand obligation is the first day on which there is a
    failure to perform the obligation, once a demand for the performance is made.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Same</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4)       Subsection
    (3) applies in respect of every demand obligation created on or after January
    1, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This amendment demonstrates the intent of the
    legislature that for all demand obligations, a demand is a condition precedent
    for the commencement of the limitation period. The legislature may be taken to
    have recognized that this puts the creditor in the position to extend the limitation
    period by failing to make a prompt demand. However, it creates more certainty
    in establishing the commencement date for the limitation period. Although this
    new section does not affect this case, it affirms the law regarding third party
    demand guarantees.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issue 3:  Did the
    Bank’s first letter constitute a demand on the guarantor?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A demand under a demand guarantee must be clear and
    unequivocal: <i>Bank of Nova Scotia v. Mabey</i> (1979), 26 N.B.R. (2d) 536; <i>Royal Bank v.
    Ruben</i> (1978), 24 N.B.R. (2d) 707; McGuinness, <i>The Law of Guarantee</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. at para. 6.26.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that it was the second letter
    from the Bank’s solicitor that constituted demand on the guarantor and that the
    first letter was sent merely to advise  the guarantor that if the principal debtor,
    Ancon, did not pay the debt, then the Bank would look to the guarantor for
    payment. I agree with the motion judge’s finding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge founded his conclusion on a comparison
    of the letters sent to Ancon and to the appellant on October 20, 2004 as well
    as a further comparison with the second letter sent to the appellant. The
    October 20 letter to Ancon was a clear demand for payment from Ancon, while the
    October 20 letter sent to the appellant referenced the demand on Ancon and said
    that if Ancon did not respond to the demand with payment, then the Bank would
    take steps to collect from the appellant. The second letter to the appellant in
    2007 unequivocally demands payment from him under the guarantee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also observed that it was the evidence
    of the bank representative that the first letter was sent as a courtesy to the
    appellant and that there was no evidence that the appellant believed the first
    letter was a demand. The appellant objects to the use of this extrinsic
    evidence to interpret the letters. In my view, the motion judge made no error
    by referring to these observations; he was not using this evidence as a makeweight
    in his interpretation of the letters but merely observing that there was no
    evidence to the contrary. The evidence of the bank manager was elicited in
    cross-examination. I infer that the motion judge’s references to the evidence
    and lack of evidence on the point indicate that had there been evidence that
    the appellant believed the first letter was a demand, the motion judge would
    have assessed that evidence and that of the bank manager in light of the rules
    of evidence and dealt with it accordingly.</p>
