style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A defendant pleads that the plaintiff failed to
    mitigate her damages.  The plaintiff
    asserts that she relied on the advice of her solicitor as to the steps the
    defendant alleges she should have taken in mitigation.  Is it open to the defendant to bring third
    party proceedings against the plaintiff’s solicitor alleging that the
    solicitor’s advice in relation to mitigation was neglige</a>nt? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held that there is no such claim in
    law and accordingly struck out the third party claim under Rule 21 as
    disclosing no cause of action.  The
    defendants CIBC World Markets Inc. (“CIBC WM”) and Grant Neuber appeal that
    order, arguing that it is not plain and obvious that they have no claim against
    the proposed third party solicitor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal
    and affirm the motion judge’s order striking out the third party claim. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this appeal involves a motion to strike a claim at
    the pleading stage under Rule 21 as disclosing no cause of action, the facts as
    pleaded in the third party claim must be taken as true.  Those facts, with some amplification from the
    statements of claim and defence, are as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff Deborah Marie Davy is the estate trustee
    for her father, Ted Davy, who had an account with CIBC World Markets Inc.  The appellant Grant Neuber was his CIBC WM
    investment advisor.  The plaintiff’s
    claim against CIBC WM and Neuber arises from their handling of shares Ted Davy
    owned in Canada Life Financial Corporation (“the shares”).  The plaintiff alleges that, despite their
    knowledge of Ted Davy’s mental incapacity, the appellants accepted his
    instructions to transfer the shares into a joint account that Ted Davy had with
    his wife, Joan Egan, and then accepted Joan Egan’s instructions to transfer the
    shares into an account solely in her name. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their statement of defence, the appellants deny any
    knowledge of Ted Davy’s lack of mental capacity and assert that Joan Egan acted
    in accordance with the terms of the joint account and a power of attorney she
    held in relation to Ted Davy’s property.  The appellants plead that they committed no wrong in following the
    instructions they received.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the shares were transferred by CIBC WM into the
    joint account, the plaintiff’s solicitor wrote to CIBC WM to request that the
    account be frozen.  CIBC WM advised the
    plaintiff that a court order would be required to freeze the account and
    refused to freeze the account without such an order.  The plaintiff did not move for a court order
    and Joan Egan transferred the shares, first from the joint account to an
    account in her own name, and subsequently to an account she held with another
    financial institution. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff claims damages for conversion and breach
    of fiduciary duty, alleging that the wrongful actions of CIBC WM and Neuber
    diminished the value of her father’s estate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their amended statement of defence to the
    plaintiff’s claim, the appellants deny liability but also plead that to the
    extent they are liable, the plaintiff failed to mitigate the losses claimed by
    failing to move for a court order freezing the joint account.  The plaintiff does not respond specifically
    to that allegation in her reply, but on oral discovery, when asked why she did
    not move for a freezing order, she stated that she relied on the advice or her
    solicitor, the respondent and proposed third party, Robert Henry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Armed with that information, the appellants applied for
    and obtained leave to commence third party proceedings against Henry.  In their third party statement of claim, the
    appellants allege Henry breached his fiduciary duties and duties of care to the
    plaintiff, <i>inter alia</i>, by advising
    the plaintiff not to obtain a court order freezing Egan’s account and by
    failing to advise the plaintiff to otherwise take reasonable steps to preserve
    the shares.  The respondent moved to
    strike out the third party claim on the ground that it disclosed no valid cause
    of action.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>POSITIONS
    OF THE PARTIES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argued before the motion judge and
    before this court that it is possible that the trial judge will find that the
    plaintiff acted reasonably in relying upon Henry’s advice not to seek a court
    order even if that advice was negligent.  The appellants submit that if the trial judge were to find that it was
    reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the advice, the plaintiff would not be
    found to have failed to mitigate.  This,
    say the appellants, leaves open the possibility that the plaintiff would
    recover full damages against them and that they therefore have a third party
    claim for contribution and indemnity against Henry pursuant to the <i>Negligence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent relies on the decision of McLachlin J.A.
    in <i>Adams v. Thompson, Berwick, Pratt
    &amp; Partners et al.</i> (1987), 39 D.L.R. (4th) 314 (B.C.C.A.) holding that
    because mitigation is the plaintiff’s obligation, any fault alleged against a
    solicitor in advising a client is wholly attributable to the plaintiff.  The respondent submits that this is to be
    distinguished from situations where the proposed third party was implicated in
    the events provoking the loss and where the appellants and the proposed third
    party were jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for the entire
    loss.  Here, by contrast, the alleged
    negligence of the proposed third party relates to events that took place <i>after</i> the breach that caused the loss,
    and relates to the plaintiff’s post-breach obligation to take reasonable steps
    to reduce, not avoid, the loss caused by the appellant’s breach.  The appellants can raise contributory
    negligence and failure to mitigate in defence to the plaintiff’s claim to
    reduce the quantum of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled, but they
    cannot claim indemnity. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provisions of the <i>Negligence Act</i> are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Extent
    of liability, remedy over</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a
name=S1></a><b>      1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
    damages have been caused or contributed to by the fault or neglect of two or
    more persons, the Court shall determine the degree in which each of such
    persons is at fault or negligent, and, where two or more persons are found at
    fault or negligent, they are jointly and severally liable to the person suffering
    loss or damage for such fault or negligence, but as between themselves, in the
    absence of any contract express or implied, each is liable to make contribution
    and indemnify each other in the degree in which they are respectively found to
    be at fault or negligent.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Recovery as between tortfeasors</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a
name=S2></a><b>      2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A
    tortfeasor may recover contribution or indemnity from any other tortfeasor who
    is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the damage to any person
    suffering damage as a result of a tort by settling with the person suffering
    such damage, and thereafter commencing or continuing action against such other
    tortfeasor, in which event the tortfeasor settling the damage shall satisfy the
    Court that the amount of the settlement was reasonable, and in the event that
    the Court finds the amount of the settlement was excessive it may fix the
    amount at which the claim should have been settled.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a
name=S3></a>      <b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In any
    action for damages that is founded upon the fault or negligence of the
    defendant if fault or negligence is found on the part of the plaintiff that
    contributed to the damages, the Court shall apportion the damages in proportion
    to the degree of fault or negligence found against the parties respectively.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Adding parties</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name=S5></a>      <b>5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever it appears that a
    person not already a party to an action is or may be wholly or partly
    responsible for the damages claimed, such person may be added as a party
    defendant to the action upon such terms as are considered just or may be made a
    third party to the action in the manner prescribed by the rules of court for
    adding third parties. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF
    THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his careful and detailed reasons for judgment, the
    motion judge concluded that the third party claim should be struck out as
    disclosing no cause of action.  He
    followed <i>Adams</i> and explained, at
    para. 26,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>if</span> the trial judge
    determines that [the plaintiff’s] failure to obtain a court order constituted a
    failure to mitigate damages, then a reduction of damages may be made to reflect
    the extent of her contributory fault: <i>Negligence
    Act</i>, s. 3.  <span class=GramE>The
    plaintiff’s judgment against CIBC WM having been reduced to reflect that
    contributory fault, what amount remains for which CIBC WM could claim
    contribution and indemnity from Henry?</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge err by striking out the third
    party claim as disclosing no cause of action? </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there is no
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    case specifically on point, I agree with the motion judge that the decision of
    McLachlin J.A. in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Adams</i><i> </i>should be followed.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Adams</i><i>, </i>the
    plaintiff property owners<i> </i>claimed
    damages for negligence against the defendant engineers for damages flowing from
    the development of a proposed subdivision of the plaintiffs’ lands.  The defendant engineers brought a third party
    claim against the plaintiffs’ solicitors alleging that the solicitors had
    provided the plaintiffs with negligent advice in relation to the
    development.  The main allegation against
    the solicitors was that they failed to advise the plaintiffs of their duty to
    mitigate their losses by selling the property at a certain point.  Writing for the court, at p. 318, McLachlin
    J.A. upheld an order striking out the third party claim at the pleading stage
    on the principle that “a third party claim will not lie against another person
    with respect to an obligation belonging to the plaintiff which the defendant
    can raise directly against the plaintiff”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondent that there is a clear
    distinction to be drawn between a plea of mitigation in defence to the plaintiff’s
    claim and a claim against a third party who was implicated in the initial loss
    and is thereby jointly and severally liable for the same loss that the
    plaintiff claims against the defendant.  In the latter situation, the fault of the third party does not have the
    effect of reducing the damages that the plaintiff may claim against the named
    defendant.  The defendant and the third
    party are each liable to the plaintiff for the full amount of the loss.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A plea of failure to mitigate is of an entirely different
    character.  Such a plea arises after the
    loss has been suffered and relates to events or conduct unrelated to the cause
    of the initial loss.  In my view, the
    defendant has no claim in law against the plaintiff’s solicitor for advice
    given to the plaintiff as to how to mitigate the loss caused by the defendant’s
    own wrong. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff’s solicitor owes the defendant no common
    law duty of care; if the defendant has a claim, it could only arise under the <i>Negligence Act</i>.  A claim for contribution or indemnity under
    s. 1 arises “where damages have been caused or contributed to by the fault or
    neglect of two or more persons”.  The <i>Negligence Act</i> does not diminish the
    amount that the plaintiff can recover from either wrongdoer on account of the
    fault of the other, but allows the wrongdoer named as a defendant to claim
    contribution by way of third party proceedings against the other wrongdoer
    based upon their respective degrees fault.  A plea that the plaintiff failed to mitigate is not embraced by this provision.  It is a defence to the plaintiff’s initial
    claim that reduces the amount that the plaintiff may recover from the defendant
    by shifting some portion of the responsibility for the wrong to the
    plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the plaintiff relied upon advice from a
    solicitor that was negligent or given in breach of the solicitor’s fiduciary
    duty, I fail to see how the solicitor’s fault with respect to mitigating the
    loss can trigger a claim on the part of the defendant under the <i>Negligence Act</i> for having jointly caused
    the loss.  The damages have not been
    “caused or contributed to by the fault or neglect of two or more persons”.  The damages were caused solely by the
    defendant.  The defendant’s complaint is
    that the plaintiff failed to take post-loss steps to reduce the loss.  As the fault of the proposed third party
    related to the reduction of the impact of the loss after it was suffered, and not
    to causing or failing to avoid the loss when it did occur, the proposed third
    party is not, in the words of s. 1 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i>, “jointly and severally liable to the person suffering loss or damage”
    and not “liable to make contribution and indemnify” the defendant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise, no claim arises under s. 2. This is not a
    claim by one tortfeasor who has settled with a plaintiff and, in any event, the
    solicitor is not a “tortfeasor who is, or could if sued have been, liable<i> in respect of the damage</i>” (emphasis
    added) for which the appellants are allegedly liable.  Finally, s. 5 is purely procedural in nature
    and deals with the right to contribution created by s. 1.  It does not create a right to contribution
    and confers no substantive rights: <i>HSBC
    Securities (Canada) Inc. v. Davies, Ward &amp; Beck</i> (2005), 74 O.R. (3d)
    295, at para. 62.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The decision of
    this court in <i>478649 Ontario Limited v.
    Corcoran</i> (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 28 (C.A.), where a third party claim against
    the plaintiff’s solicitor was allowed, is distinguishable.  In <i>Corcoran</i>,
    the plaintiff sued the vendor and a real estate agent for negligent
    misrepresentations in relation to the purchase of a commercial property.  In their third party claim against the
    plaintiff’s solicitors, the defendant alleged that the solicitors had been
    negligent in reviewing the agreement of purchase and sale and failing to
    protect the interests of the plaintiff.  That was not a plea in<i> </i>mitigation
    of damages that the defendants could advance against the plaintiff but rather
    an allegation that the solicitors were implicated in the very events that gave
    rise to the loss and were jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for any
    loss suffered.  As the plaintiff had not
    sued<i> </i>the solicitors, the only way the
    defendants could protect their position and avoid being held liable for the
    entire loss was to claim contribution and indemnity from the solicitors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cases cited by the appellants where third party
    claims were allowed to proceed, like <i>Corcoran</i>,
    involve claims of this nature.  That is,
    they are claims for contribution and indemnity against a party alleged to have
    been implicated in the events giving rise to the initial loss and who is
    thereby jointly and severally liable with the defendant for the entire
    loss:  see e.g. <i>Cardar Investments Ltd. v. Thorne Riddell</i> (1989), 71 O.R. (2d) 29
    (Divl.
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Anderson</i> [2001] O.J. No. 1386 (S.C.J.).  I note as
    well that the distinction between <i>Adams</i> and <i>Corcoran</i> was recently affirmed by
    this court in <i>Macchi s.p.a. v. New
    Solution Extrusion Inc.</i> 2008 ONCA 586, at paras. 1-2:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>On the pleadings as
    they stand, any negligence alleged against the proposed third party is
    attributable to the plaintiff.  The
    statement of claim shows that Macchi has not distanced itself from
    responsibility for, or the consequences of, any negligence on the part of its
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'><span class="Doubleindent-quote">In the
    circumstances therefore, the principle in</span> <span class=italic1><span
style='color:black'>Adams v. Thompson, Berwick, Pratt &amp; Partners</span></span> (1987), 39 D.L.R. (4th) 314 at 319, rather than that in <span class=italic1><span
style='color:black'>478649 Ontario Limited v. Corcoran</span></span> (1994), 20
    O.R. (3d) 28 applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the appellants’ argument that their plea
    of mitigation may fail even though the proposed third party’s advice to the
    plaintiff was negligent or in breach of his fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When considering a solicitor’s advice on the steps to
    be taken by way of mitigation, the solicitor will have to be accorded
    considerable latitude.  A plaintiff is
    required only to act reasonably in mitigation.  To this effect, Lord Macmillan noted in <i>Banco de Portugal v. Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd.</i>, [1932] A.C. 452, at
    p. 506, that “[t]he law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult
    situation...acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures and he will
    not be held disentitled...merely because the party in breach can suggest...other
    measures less burdensome”.  The standard
    for reasonableness articulated in the case law is relatively low, described by
    James L.J. in <i>Dunkirk Colliery Co. v.
    Lever</i>, [1912] A.C.673 as not requiring the plaintiff to do anything other
    than in the ordinary course of business.  As Prof. Waddams puts it in <i>The
    Law of Damages</i> (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2008), at para. 15.140, “[i]n
    case of doubt, the plaintiff will usually receive the benefit, because it does
    not lie in the mouth of the defendant to be over-critical of good faith
    attempts by the plaintiff to extricate himself from difficultly caused by the
    defendant’s wrong.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As those statements of principle suggest, a plaintiff
    whose rights have been violated is not required to undertake burdensome or
    risky measures to mitigate the loss he or she has suffered.  No doubt, a solicitor would take that into
    account when advising a plaintiff and indeed, a solicitor who failed to do so
    would be negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that those statements of principle also
    suggest that it is possible that a plaintiff who relies on a solicitor’s advice
    might be found to have acted reasonably for the purposes of satisfying the duty
    to mitigate, even where the solicitor’s advice was negligent.  However, for the reasons I have explained, I
    see no basis in law for allowing the defendant to assert a claim against the
    plaintiff’s solicitor even in such a circumstance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add that there appears to me to be strong
    underlying policy reasons that support this result.  The defendant is, after all, a wrongdoer who
    caused the plaintiff loss, and a plea of mitigation does not excuse or justify
    the wrong, nor does it rest on the attribution of partial responsibility for
    the wrong to some other party. Obvious mischief arises from allowing one party
    to sue another party’s solicitor.  Such
    claims invade the sanctity of the solicitor-client relationship.  The solicitor’s loyalty to the client is
    undermined.  Difficult issues regarding
    solicitor-client privilege are bound to arise in relation to the solicitor’s
    defence. These policy reasons cannot prevail in cases like <i>Corcoran</i> where the defendant has a valid legal claim against
    solicitor for contribution and indemnity, but in a case such as the present
    one, the policy coincides with the strict letter of the law.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with
    costs to the respondent fixed in the amount agreed by the parties, namely $7500
    inclusive of disbursements an<i>d GST</i>.</p>
