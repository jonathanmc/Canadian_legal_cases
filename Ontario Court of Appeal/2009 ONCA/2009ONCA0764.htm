  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of the purposes of a letter of credit is to
    provide some measure of protection to a seller of goods that the seller will be
    paid in a timely fashion upon delivery of the goods to the buyer.  In this case, Thai Fisheries Co. Ltd.
    accepted letters of credit from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in an
    attempt to ensure payment for shipments of large quantities of Thai shrimp to
    Douglas R. Robertson International Inc. in the United States.  The shrimp were destined for ultimate
    purchase by Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, however – in circumstances I shall
    outline below – the letters of credit proved to be of little comfort to Thai
    Fisheries.  It is short approximately $10.4
    million on the shrimp it supplied to Robertson.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Robertson was a customer of CIBC, and financed
    the purchase of the shrimp through a credit facility arranged with the Bank.
    Upon arrival in the United States, the shrimp were stored in large warehouses –
    known as Customer Distribution Centers (“CDC’s”) – where they awaited purchase from
    the various Sam’s Club outlets.  Payment
    was to be made under the letters of credit upon presentation to CIBC of
    purchase orders and receipts showing that the shrimp had been taken down by
    Sam’s Club.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Thai Fisheries has not been paid for
    all of the shrimp it supplied under the letters of credit, the proceeds of sale
    from the shrimp were used by Robertson and the Bank to reduce the Robertson
    line of credit that had been arranged to finance the trade transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thai Fisheries says that CIBC and Robertson colluded
    to reduce Robertson’s line of credit – and therefore the Bank’s exposure – by
    arranging for shrimp to be sold without documentation from Sam’s Club and then
    relying on non-compliance with the letters of credit to refuse payments, while
    at the same time directing the monies received to reduce Robertson’s overdraft instead
    of ensuring that the monies were used to pay Thai Fisheries under letters of credit,
    as should have been done.  CIBC says that
    it did nothing improper, that it complied with the provisions of the letters of
    credit, which were not honoured because the requisite documentation was not
    presented, and that Thai Fisheries knowingly ran the risk of such an
    eventuality when it accepted the letters of credit in the first place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ruled in favour of Thai Fisheries
    and granted judgment in its favour in the amount of $10,381,035,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> together with pre-judgment interest and costs.  In my view, he was correct in arriving at this disposition, and I would
    dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.</p>
  <h3>FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the early 1990s, Robertson concluded that
    there was a commercial opportunity for the supply of large quantities of shrimp
    to the North American market and, in particular, to Sam’s Club.  It secured a contract with the Wal-Mart
    division for that purpose and then entered into an agreement with Thai
    Fisheries<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> for the purchase and shipment of shrimp (both raw and cooked) from Thailand in
    order to satisfy the Sam’s Club contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This led to the creation of a network of
    financing arrangements between CIBC, Robertson and Thai Fisheries to give
    effect to their commercial relationship.  The particulars of these arrangements, and the circumstances giving rise
    to the dispute in these proceedings, are clearly described in the thorough and
    careful reasons of the trial judge.  Much
    of what follows is taken from those reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thai Fisheries required some assurance that it
    would be paid for the shrimp it was delivering to Robertson.  Robertson needed to bridge the time between
    when it would have to pay Thai Fisheries for the shrimp delivered and when the
    shrimp would be accepted and paid for by Sam’s Club.  To that end, Robertson approached CIBC and
    arranged a line of credit – ultimately exceeding $20 million -- to enable it to
    bridge this gap.  The Bank then issued letters
    of credit to facilitate payment to Thai Fisheries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> These
    arrangements were first made in 1993 (a year in which the shrimp was supplied
    and paid for to everyone’s satisfaction) and continued in a different form in
    1994 (the year in which the problems giving rise to this lawsuit arose).  The differences in form are significant only
    for an understanding of the evolution of the financing arrangements.  </p>
  <h3>The 1993 Arrangements</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1993, CIBC issued two documentary letters of
    credit which specified that payment would be made to Thai Fisheries once the
    Bank had received documentary proof confirming that the shrimp had cleared the
    Unites States Food and Drug Administration Inspection (“FDA Inspection”).  The Bank was permitted, under the terms of
    the 1993 letters of credit, to release the title documents provided by Thai
    Fisheries to Robertson for purposes of the FDA Inspection.  CIBC’s payment to Thai Fisheries was made
    from a drawdown on Robertson’s line of credit with the Bank.  Once Robertson was paid by Sam’s Club,
    Robertson would pay down its line of credit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As indicated, the dealings between the parties
    under the 1993 arrangements are not the subject of this dispute.  The 1993 letters of credit expired in January
    1994, at which time the parties began to negotiate another set of terms to
    govern their financing relationship.</p>
  <h3>The 1994 Arrangements</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CIBC was not satisfied with the 1993
    arrangements.  Although it had a general
    security agreement from Sam’s Club and an additional stand-by letter of credit
    in its favour from Nationbank – issued on the account of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    (Sam’s Club) – CIBC still felt over-exposed.  It was concerned about the length of time between its obligation to pay
    Thai Fisheries under the letters of credit, and Sam’s Club’s acceptance of the
    shrimp and subsequent payment to Robertson.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CIBC sought to address the problem through
    changes in the letters of credit.  A
    number of alternatives were considered and rejected.  Finally, it was agreed that payment to Thai Fisheries
    would be delayed under the provisions of the letters of credit until a purchase
    order had been delivered by Sam’s Club, when a store required the shrimp, along
    with a delivery receipt (together, “the Receipts”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A new letter of credit was issued on June 9, 1994,
    containing the following “Special Condition” to give effect to the foregoing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Payment of drafts or drafts drawn hereunder will be
    effected when accompanied by required documents and after receipt from the
    applicant of a signed purchase order(s) issued by Sam's Club and related
    delivery receipt(s) showing container number(s), number of cartons and
    evidencing that goods have been received by Sam’s Club Distribution Centre(s).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Documents may be delivered to the applicant, if
    requested by them, against their signed receipt and prior to payment in order
    to provide clearance of the merchandise to secure inspection by the U.S. FDA
    authorities and to effect delivery of merchandise to Sam’s Club when approved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the trial judge noted, the Special Condition
    created an arrangement that “was not typical” because the seller no longer “<span
class=GramE>control[</span>led] the satisfaction of conditions necessary for
    payment.”  This differed from the
    standard letter of credit requirements that call for payment to be made upon
    delivery of the title documents to the Bank.  While the new arrangements provided added protection for CIBC, they
    created a potential difficulty for Thai Fisheries, which the trial judge
    described in this fashion: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, [the
    letter of credit] included the condition that no payments would be made under
    the Letter of Credit until a purchase order and receipt had been delivered by
    Sam’s Club.  <span class=StyleItalic><i>This
    provided the CIBC with the protection it sought</i>.</span>  The gap in time between payment under the
    Letter of Credit and receipt by Robertson of payment from Sam’s Club would be
    reduced.  <span class=StyleItalic><i>The
    difficulty that this presented for Thai Fisheries was that, by entering into
    this arrangement, it ceded control over when it would receive payment to a
    third party</i></span> – Sam’s Club.  If
    Sam’s Club did not require the shrimp, it would not issue the purchase orders
    that were a prerequisite for payment.  <span
class=StyleItalic><i>Moreover, by delaying the delivery of the receipts,
    Robertson and the CIBC could control the flow of money to Thai Fisheries</i></span>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found, nonetheless, that all
    three parties – Robertson, CIBC and Thai Fisheries – understood the impact of
    these changes.  Robertson and CIBC, in
    particular, understood that Robertson “[could] control payments by when [it]
    provides delivery slips.”  At the same
    time, Dr. Marut, the commercially sophisticated President of Thai Fisheries,
    also understood the implications of the changes leading to the Special Conditions.  He knew that under the new terms, the
    documentation provided to the Bank would be delivered to Robertson both to
    assist in clearing FDA Inspection and for delivery to the CDC’s utilized by
    Sam’s Club, where they would remain until the Receipts were provided from Sam’s
    Club; only then would Thai Fisheries be paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In October 1994, two new letters of credit were
    issued.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  Both contained the first part of the Special
    Conditions in the letter of credit dated June 9, 1994, cited in para. 15 above,
    but not the entirety of the second clause (i.e., the provision for release of
    the documents to Robertson “to effect delivery of merchandise to Sam’s Club
    when approved”).  Instead, the October
    1994 letters of credit simply provided that “prior to payment, documents may be
    delivered to the applicant [Robertson], if requested by them, against their
    signed receipt.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties conducted themselves, however, as if
    there were no difference in the language of the 1994 Letters of Credit, and no
    one made an issue of that difference at trial.  Indeed, in every case involving shipments under the Letters of Credit, CIBC
    required Robertson to sign a specific undertaking to deliver the Receipts prior
    to releasing the bills of lading.  As Mr.
    Purvis testified, “the original intended structure” under the Letters of Credit
    was that the bills of lading would be provided to Robertson for the purposes of
    delivery to Sam’s Club so that the additional documents – the purchase orders
    and receipts – would be obtained and payment made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The typical undertaking referred to the Letter
    of Credit in question and was entitled “L/C Text <i>and Amendments</i>.” [Emphasis added.]  It was signed by Robertson, and stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We hereby acknowledge receipt of documents relating
    to the above drawings(s).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We undertake to
    deliver to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce a signed purchase order issued by
    Sam’s Club and related delivery receipt as per terms of the credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Purvis testified that if the Bank believed
    there were receipts and purchase orders outstanding for product that had been
    delivered to and purchased by Sam’s, but for which receipts had not been given
    to the Bank, CIBC would have enforced the undertaking.  It turned out, as I shall explain later, that
    the Bank did not do so, but it seems clear, nonetheless, that the provision permitting
    title documents to be released to Robertson prior to payment only to effect
    delivery of the shrimp to Sam’s Club was consistent with the nature and purpose
    of the new arrangements negotiated between the parties with respect to the 1994
    shipments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    reference to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits in the
    following form:  “This cable is the

    Credits (“Uniform Customs”) are a non-governmental codification of customs and
    practices promulgated by the International Chamber of Commerce, and are very
    widely adopted by financial institutions issuing letters of credit.  Frequently, the parties incorporate the
    provisions of the Uniform Customs into the letter of credit by reference.  For purposes of this case, the relevant
    Uniform Customs is the 1993 version, known as “UCP 500”.  Whether the parties incorporated its
    provisions into the Letters of Credit in this case is an issue to which I will
    return. </p>
  <h3>The Breakdown of the Relationship</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Problems began to arise between Robertson and
    Thai Fisheries respecting the shrimp in the fall of 1994 and into 1995.  Neither the precise nature of the problems, nor
    their cause, is clear from the record, partly because – as the trial judge
    observed – no one from either Robertson or Sam’s Club was called to give
    evidence.  The particulars matter little for
    purposes of the appeal, however.  Whatever the details of the disputes, the Receipts were not delivered by
    Robertson to the Bank and, as a result, Thai Fisheries did not receive payment
    for substantial amounts of shrimp supplied.  It complained, but continued to make shipments, apparently believing
    that the problems with respect to the delivery of the Receipts were being
    addressed by Robertson.  CIBC agreed to
    make partial payments covering the cooked shrimp but not the raw shrimp and the
    relationship sputtered along for some time.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The last shipment under the Letters of Credit
    was in December 1994 and the last payment received by Thai Fisheries ($533,387)
    was in February 1995.  In total, Thai
    Fisheries supplied shrimp valued at almost $40 million under the 1994 Letters
    of Credit and it received payments amounting to approximately $29.5
    million.  The unpaid balance remaining
    was $10,381,035 – the amount awarded by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sam’s Club continued to draw down on the Thai
    Fisheries’ shrimp that had been delivered to its warehouses, however.  In February 1995, it indicated that it would
    continue to order cooked shrimp from its warehouse operations until the end of
    March 1995.  Orders for cooked shrimp
    supplied by Thai Fisheries were delivered from Robertson to Sam’s Club from
    January until April 1995.  The value of
    those orders totalled $6,964,417.30.  Except
    for the last $533,387 payment in February 1995, Thai Fisheries was never paid
    for these shipments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the Letters of Credit arrangements, the
    foregoing shipments would have resulted in delivery of the Receipts from Sam’s
    Club to Robertson and from Robertson to the Bank.  CIBC would, in turn, have released payment to
    Thai Fisheries and debited Robertson’s line of credit accordingly.  In fact, however, no Receipts were ever provided
    to CIBC for that shrimp and Thai Fisheries did not receive payment for the
    remaining $6,431,030.30.  Those proceeds
    of sale were used by Robertson and CIBC, nonetheless, to pay down Robertson’s
    line of credit at the Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a meeting in June 1995, Robertson advised
    CIBC that there were no outstanding delivery receipts from Sam’s Club and that
    there would be no further shipments to Sam’s Club.  Mr. Purvis admitted the Bank had been told
    that Robertson “might withhold these documents.”  Thai Fisheries was not advised of these
    developments at the time, although the Letters of Credit were left open and not
    cancelled for more than another year (thus inducing Thai Fisheries to take no
    steps to recover the shrimp in the meantime, as Robertson’s other major
    supplier, Magnate, had done).</p>
  <h3>The Pay-Down of Robertson’s Line of Credit with
    CIBC</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the meantime, CIBC and Robertson were working
    together to reduce Robertson’s indebtedness to the Bank, which at one point
    exceeded $19 million.  The reduction of
    this debt was admittedly the Bank’s primary concern during this period.  The plan was successful.  By year-end 1995, the Robertson overdraft had
    been reduced to approximately $450,000, and by February 29, 1996, it stood at
    $6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Monies received by Robertson in payment for
    shrimp supplied by Thai Fisheries were used to pay down the Robertson line of
    credit, without any reciprocal payment being made to Thai Fisheries under the
    Letters of Credit.  CIBC knew this was
    happening and that Sam’s Club had taken Thai Fisheries shrimp from its
    warehouses for which Thai Fisheries had not been paid.   The trial judge made the following important
    finding, which appellant’s counsel concedes is supported by the evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>David Purvis was very
    clear in his evidence.  The CIBC’s
    principal concern was in ensuring that it was paid the money that it was
    owed.  No money was paid to Thai
    Fisheries, under the Letters of Credit, after February 6, 1995.  The CIBC knew from its review of the
    Reconciliation prepared as of April 1, 1995 that between January 28, 1995 and
    April 1, 1995, Sam’s Club took delivery of (US)$6,964,417.30 worth of shrimp …
    CIBC’s records show the payments made to Thai Fisheries, pursuant to the
    Letters of Credit.  The CIBC would have
    known that the last payments made were on February 6, 1995 and that those
    payments were valued at (US<span class=GramE>)$</span>533,387 … Accordingly,
    there ought to have been purchase orders valued at (US)$6,431,030.30
    ((US)$6,964,417.30 – (US)$533,387.00) forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, in collaboration with Robertson, CIBC
    permitted Robertson inventory to be sold to others, with the proceeds used to
    pay down the Robertson overdraft.  As the
    trial judge noted, this inventory included Thai Fisheries shrimp that had been
    delivered to Robertson for sale to Sam’s Club under the Letters of Credit.  Thai Fisheries was never told of the
    agreement between Robertson and the Bank that the shrimp it supplied was to be taken,
    sold to purchasers other than Sam’s Club, and the revenue utilized to reduce Robertson’s
    debt to the CIBC.  The trial judge found
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By proceeding in this way, <span class=StyleItalic><i>the
    CIBC was a party to an arrangement that ensured that the beneficiary to the
    Letters of Credit it had issued would not be paid</i>.</span>  The potential draws on the Letters of Credit
    those shrimp represented would never take place because the shrimp would never
    be delivered to Sam’s Club and the purchase orders from Sam’s Club that were a
    prerequisite to Thai Fisheries being paid would never be presented.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In June 1996 – after the Robertson debt to CIBC
    had been eliminated – Robertson wrote to Thai Fisheries enclosing what it said
    was a letter the CIBC intended to send to Thai Fisheries’ bankers in
    Bangkok.  The proposed CIBC letter was to
    advise that the Letters of Credit had expired because the conditions for
    payment would not be met.  Robertson
    suggested that if the letter were sent it might cause Thai Fisheries some
    difficulties with their bankers and proposed that these difficulties could be
    avoided if Thai Fisheries were willing to give Robertson the appropriate
    releases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the trial judge observed, Thai Fisheries’
    response was “to the point”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With regard to your 25
    June, 1996 letter concerning CIBC letters of credit, we will not release the
    L/C’s or any party, including CIBC.  <span
class=GramE>Unless satisfactory arrangements made for payment of debts to TFC,
    no release.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In October 1996, Thai Fisheries received from
    its bank in Bangkok a copy of a letter from CIBC advising that the Letters of
    Credit had expired.  This lawsuit
    followed.</p>

  <h3>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held that by accepting the
    monies in payment of the loans it had made, CIBC acted as a lender seeking
    satisfaction of what it was owed.  But,
    in so doing, it failed in its duty as the issuer of the Letters of Credit, and
    breached the separate and independent contract it had entered into with Thai
    Fisheries.  To hold otherwise, he explained,
    “would encourage the CIBC to act with the buyer to sell to someone other than
    Sam’s Club, bypass the Letters of Credit under which the product was delivered
    (since no purchase order could ever be forthcoming), and use the money to pay
    down the debt rather than pay for the goods.”  Such an interpretation would defeat the security offered to the seller
    by issuing the Letters of Credit in the first place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, the trial judge was satisfied that
    CIBC had breached an implied term in the contractual relationship between CIBC
    and Thai Fisheries – an implied duty of good faith.  In its role as lender, CIBC had applied
    monies paid for the purchase of the goods to pay down its loans, rather than
    holding them on account for the seller.  In doing so, CIBC acted to defeat the purpose of the letters of credit
    and in violation of its duty to consider Thai Fisheries’ draw on the credit
    independently, in accordance with the principle of autonomy of letters of
    credit.  In view of the terms of the
    Letters of Credit – permitting release of the title documents to Robertson only
    for purposes of FDA Inspection and subsequent delivery to Sam’s Club, and
    subject to the “amending” undertaking – this is even more clearly the case when
    CIBC, in its role as a lender, arranged with its customer/buyer for the sale of
    shrimp outside the terms of the Letters of Credit, under which the product was
    already delivered.  To suggest that
    CIBC’s stepping in to realize on its loan represented the intention of the
    parties when they entered into the Letters of Credit is to propose that there
    was no intention to supply any comfort or security to Thai Fisheries.  Such a conclusion would remove the
    contractual link to Thai Fisheries, which would in turn have no assurance of
    payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, the trial judge awarded Thai
    Fisheries – the predecessor of Nareerux Import Co. Ltd – damages in the amount
    of $10,381,035, representing the amount outstanding on the 1994 Letters of
    Credit for the shrimp delivered.</p>
  <h3>THE APPELLANT’S POSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CIBC takes the position that using the purchase
    monies for these shrimp to reduce Robertson’s indebtedness to it, without
    corresponding payments being made to Thai Fisheries, was justified because the Special
    Conditions for payment under the Letters of Credit were not complied with –
    that is, the Receipts from Sam’s Club, which would have triggered payment, were
    never provided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CIBC argues, in substance, that the Bank
    protected itself by the Special Conditions negotiated in the Letters of Credit,
    and that Thai Fisheries – a large, sophisticated commercial enterprise presided
    over by an experienced, sophisticated businessman fully familiar with the
    operation of letters of credit – assumed the risk of what happened as the price
    of continuing its lucrative business with Wal-Mart in North America.  The Bank submits that title in the shrimp
    passed to Robertson upon delivery of the title documents by Thai Fisheries to
    the Bank, and that both Robertson and the Bank acquired an interest in them at
    that time – Robertson as owner and the Bank as a secured creditor.  The use of the sale proceeds from the shrimp
    supplied by Thai Fisheries to reduce Robertson’s line of credit with the Bank
    was justified when the documentary requirements for payment under the Letters
    of Credit failed to materialize.  What
    the trial judge did, Mr. Richler and Mr. Prestage contend, is to negate CIBC’s
    security, reallocate the risk from Thai Fisheries to CIBC, and write out the Special
    Conditions in the Letters of Credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

  <h3>LAW AND ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p>            <b>Summary</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the trial judge’s well-considered
    disposition of this case and – save for two caveats – with his
    conclusions.  The caveats relate (a) to
    his view that the parties did not incorporate the provisions of UCP 500 into
    the Letters of Credit (which I think, respectfully, is erroneous, but an error
    that works in favour of the respondent, and is therefore of little consequence
    to the outcome of the appeal) and (b) to his resort to language of conversion,
    agency and trust in his analysis of the payments concerned (which I do not
    think is necessary or, from the trial judge’s perspective, used by him in their
    formal traditional sense).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My view of the case may be summarized, briefly,
    as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CIBC raises one defence only: Thai Fisheries
    failed to comply with its obligation imposed by the Special Conditions in the
    Letters of Credit since the Receipts from Sam’s Club, through Robertson, were
    never delivered to the Bank.  Consistent
    with that obligation is the principle that letters of credit must be strictly
    construed.  On a strict construction of
    the contract, the Bank asserts, the delivery of the Receipts from Sam’s Club
    was a pre-condition to payment.  No
    receipts were provided for the shrimp in question, and therefore CIBC contends,
    it was not liable to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, CIBC is disentitled to rely upon the
    defence of non-compliance because, on the trial judge’s findings, it knowingly
    contributed to, or acquiesced in, the circumstances that undermined the prospect
    of strict <span class=GramE>compliance,</span> then used that non-compliance to
    justify the refusal of payment.  It did
    so in collaboration with its customer, Robertson, in order to ensure that the
    proceeds of sale of the shrimp sold under the Letters of Credit were used to
    reduce the Bank’s significant exposure on the Robertson line of credit without
    corresponding payments being made to Thai Fisheries under the Letters of
    Credit.  Whether this conduct is
    characterized as a direct breach of the principle of autonomy underpinning
    letter of credit transactions or as a breach of CIBC’s implied duty of good
    faith not to act in a fashion meant to defeat or eviscerate the purpose of the
    Letters of Credit, matters little, in my view.  On either scenario – both of which were justifiably found by the trial
    judge to exist on the facts – CIBC, as issuer of the Letters of Credit, is
    precluded from raising the defence of non-compliance.  Equity will not permit it to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a further basis for concluding that
    CIBC may not rely on the defence of non-compliance.  The Bank failed in its obligation to give
    timely notice of dishonour to Thai Fisheries when it held back on notifying the
    seller for more than a year that no Receipts would be forthcoming and that the
    Letters of Credit would be cancelled.  In
    doing so, CIBC placed Thai Fisheries in a position where it reasonably believed
    that the Letters of Credit would be honoured when the problems with the
    Receipts had been resolved.  Consequently,
    Thai Fisheries took no steps to protect <span class=GramE>itself</span> by
    seeking return of the shrimp until it was too late and the shrimp had all been
    sold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, it is my view that whether title to the
    shrimp did or did not pass to Robertson upon or at some time earlier than the
    release of the title documentation to Robertson is not material to the
    disposition of the appeal.  The <i>lis</i> here is not between the Bank and
    Thai Fisheries as secured or unsecured creditor of Robertson; the <i>lis</i> is as contractual parties to the
    Letters of Credit.  The Bank’s position
    as secured creditor of Robertson does not immunize it from its obligations to
    Thai Fisheries as issuer of the credits.</p>
  <h3>Preliminary Observations</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning now to my analysis giving rise to these
    conclusions, I begin with the following observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Letters of credit are an important and unique
    type of financial instrument designed to facilitate the flow of goods and trade.  They are frequently resorted to in
    transactions with international dimensions, where buyer and seller are
    strangers to, and distanced from, each other and are looking for some
    assurances to reduce the risks of dealing with each other.  In his text, <i>Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice</i>, 3d ed., looseleaf
    (Toronto: Thomson Canada Limited, 2009), at pp. 1-2.1 to 1-3 and 1-5, Lazar
    Sarna describes the need for letters of credit to reduce the uncertainty in international
    transactions, and the benefits to those involved:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An importer places an
    order for the purchase and shipment of goods with a foreign seller.  The importer has no reason either to trust or
    mistrust the solvency, reliability or efficiency of the foreign seller; he has
    no means of ascertaining whether in this specific transaction the foreign
    seller will ship the number and quality of goods ordered at the place and on the
    dates set out in the purchase order.  Similarly, the foreign seller has little assurance upon receipt of the
    purchase order that the importer is solvent or will pay the full amount of the
    purchase order without deductions, set-offs or counter-claims once the goods
    are delivered.  … In order to accommodate
    the expectations of both parties, it is often agreed that the importer will
    supply the foreign seller with a letter of credit which the former obtains upon
    application to his bank in his own jurisdiction.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The practical effect of financing the
    underlying contract by way of letter of credit is beneficial for all parties
    concerned.  The importer dispenses with
    the problem of advance payment, loss of interest while awaiting shipment, and
    fear of loss resulting from inadequate or late shipment.  Subject to the problem of fraud and
    subterfuge, the importer is assured that payment will only be made if the
    foreign seller strictly complies with the terms of the credit.  On the other side, the foreign seller, prior
    to shipment, has in hand a promise to pay for the shipment from a reputable
    foreign financial institution, or in the event of the intervention of a
    confirming bank, from a native bank.  From the point of view of the issuer, it is paid <span class=GramE>a
    remuneration</span> for the opening of the credit and retains the bills of
    lading and other shipping documents presented with demand of payment as
    security for reimbursement by the customer of the amount of credit extended and
    paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, letters of credit are an important mechanism
    for ensuring that international commerce flows smoothly, effectively, and with
    some degree of assurance.   As one American authority has put it, albeit
    colourfully, letters of credit are intended “to grease the wheels of trade and
    commerce”: <i>Alaska Textile Co., Inc. v.
    Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.</i>, 982 F.2d 813 (2d Cir. 1992), at p. 824.  Care is required, therefore, to ensure that they
    are not interpreted and enforced in a way that might jeopardize their
    uniqueness and commercial efficacy or the relative certainty that must surround
    their use.  Hence the doctrines of
    autonomy, strict compliance and strict construction that will be discussed
    below. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the same time, however, letters of credit are
    not completely divorced from the general rules and principles of contract law, including
    those invoking notions of fairness and equity: see <i>Mutual Export Corporation v. Westpac Banking Corporation</i>, 983 F.2d
    420 (2d Cir. 1993), at p. 423; <i>Exxon Co.
    v. Banque de Paris et des Paysbas</i>, 889 F.2d 674 (5th Cir. 1989), at p. 678, <i>cert. denied</i>, 496 U.S. 943 (1990);<i> Timber Falling Consultants, Inc. v. General
    Bank</i>, 751 F. Supp. 179 (D. Or. 1990), at p. 181;<i> Karpassia Shipping Co., S.A. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, World Trade
    Center Branch No. 232,</i> 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17285 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), at *18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For example, in <i>Karpassia Shipping</i>, at *18-19, the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York acknowledged the following notions of contractual
    interpretation in the context of a letter of credit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A construction that will sustain an instrument will
    be preferred to one that will defeat it; if an agreement is fairly capable of a
    construction that will make it valid and enforceable, that construction will be
    given it.  <span class=StyleItalic><i>The
    same general principles which apply to other contracts in writing govern
    letters of credit.  Where a letter of
    credit is fairly susceptible of two constructions, one of which makes it fair,
    customary and one which prudent men would naturally enter into</i></span><i>, <span class=StyleItalic>while the other
    makes it inequitable, the former interpretation must be preferred to the latter</span></i>,
    and a construction rendering the contract possible of performance will be
    preferred to one which renders its performance impossible or <span
class=StyleItalic><i>meaningless</i>.</span>  Moreover, as between the beneficiary of a letter of credit and the
    issuer … if ambiguity exists, the words are taken as strongly against the
    issuer as a reasonable reading will justify.  [Citations omitted; emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The type of documentary letter of credit in
    question on this appeal is one that is issued by a bank at the buyer’s request
    in favour of the seller of goods.  It generally
    provides for payment by the bank to the beneficiary upon presentation to the
    bank of title and shipping documents and compliance with all terms as specified
    in the letter of credit.  The purpose is
    to ensure prompt payment to the beneficiary (the seller) upon satisfaction of
    the stipulated conditions, without interference from, or ultimate non-payment
    by, the bank’s client (the buyer).  The
    “chief virtue” of such letters of credit has been described as their
    “predictable reliability as a payment mechanism”:  <i>Voest-Alpine
    International Corporation v. The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.</i>, 707 F.2d 680 (2d
    Cir. 1983), at p. 682.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A good general description of how such documentary
    letters of credit are designed to work is found in <i>Halsbury’s Laws of England</i>, 4th ed., vol. 41 (London: Butterworths,
    2005), at para. 375:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is often made a condition of an international
    sale contract that the buyer must pay for the goods by means of a confirmed,
    irrevocable letter of credit.  It is then
    his duty to procure his bank, known as the issuing or originating bank, to
    issue an irrevocable credit in favour of the seller by which the bank
    undertakes to the seller, either directly or through another bank in the
    seller’s country known as the correspondent or negotiating bank, to pay an
    agreed sum of money against tender by the seller of the shipping documents.  The contractual relationship between the
    issuing bank and the buyer is defined by the terms of the agreement between
    them under which the letter opening the credit is issued.  As between the seller and the bank, the issue
    of the credit duly notified to the seller creates a new contractual link and
    renders the bank directly liable to the seller to pay the purchase price or to
    accept the bill of exchange on tender of the documents.  The contract thus created between the seller
    and the bank is, by reason of the bank’s absolute undertaking to the seller,
    separate from the original contract between the buyer and the seller.  Having undertaken to pay the seller under the
    letter of credit, the bank will protect itself against non-payment by the buyer
    either by taking security from the buyer or by retaining the document of title,
    typically the bill of lading, tendered by the seller under the letter of
    credit.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A letter of credit thus exists in the context of
    three separate and distinct agreements: (i) the underlying contract between the
    buyer and seller; (ii) the contract between the buyer (the bank’s customer) and
    the bank to provide the credit; and (iii) the contract between the bank and the
    beneficiary seller that constitutes the letter of credit itself.  It is a fundamental principle of letters of
    credit – known as the principle of “autonomy”, or “independence” – that these
    contracts are separate and independent from each other.  The issuing bank’s obligation to pay under
    the letter of credit arises upon presentation of the requisite documentation
    and compliance with the terms of the credit by the beneficiary; it is not
    affected by extraneous factors.  As the
    trial judge noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This
    obligation to pay is a duty that the bank owes the seller:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The obligation of the
    issuing bank (or the confirming bank) is to pay if the terms and conditions of
    the letter of credit have been carried out by the seller.  <span class=StyleItalic><i>This obligation
    must be carried out irrespective of any dispute between the buyer and seller</i> </span><i><u>or between bank and customer</u></i>.  This has been referred to as the autonomy of
    the credit transaction.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(I.F.G. Baxter, <span class=StyleItalic>The Law
    of Banking</span>, 4th ed. (Toronto: Thompson Canada Limited, 1992) at 161)</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The corollary of the issuer’s obligation to pay,
    however, is another fundamental concept relating to letters of credit: the
    beneficiary’s obligation of strict compliance with the terms and conditions of
    the credit.  This includes the responsibility
    of the beneficiary to inspect the terms of the credit before accepting it in
    order to determine whether it meets the needs of the underlying commercial
    transaction, and to request any changes if the terms of the credit cannot be
    strictly adhered to: see <i>Tradax Petroleum
    American, Inc. v. Coral Petroleum, Inc</i>., 878 F.2d 830 (5th Cir. 1989), at
    p. 834; <i>Mutual Export</i> at 423.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted above, the only defence raised by CIBC
    is that Thai Fisheries failed to comply with its obligation of strict
    compliance.  </p>
  <h3>CIBC Is Disentitled To Rely Upon the Doctrine of
    Strict Compliance</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The central issue on this appeal, however, is
    whether CIBC had become disentitled by its conduct to rely upon the doctrine of
    strict compliance in the circumstances.  Courts
    have held that the equitable doctrines of waiver and estoppel apply in letter
    of credit cases: see e.g. <i>Morguard Trust
    Co. v. Royal Bank </i>(1988), 60 Alta. L.R. (2d) 99 (Q.B.), at p. 117, varied on
    other grounds, (1989), 70 Alta. L.R. (2d) 242 (C.A.), at p. 244; <i>Dibrell Brothers International S.A. v. Banca
    Nazionale Del Lavoro</i>, 38 F.3d 1571 (11th Cir. 1994) at p. 1581; <i>Barclays Bank D.C.O. v. Mercantile Nat’l
    Bank</i>, 481 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1973), at p. 1237, <i>cert. dismissed</i>, 414 U.S. 1139 (1974).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, the issuer of a letter of credit may be
    precluded from relying on the doctrine of strict compliance in certain
    situations.  Examples of circumstances in
    which an issuer of a letter of credit has disentitled itself to do so include
    those in which the issuer (i) has waived strict compliance, either expressly or
    by its conduct;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"

style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Setting aside the straight waiver situations and
    those involving untimely notice of dishonour for the moment, these authorities
    – albeit primarily American in origin – are instructive.  Their common rationale is that the conduct of
    the issuing bank has put it in a position where its obligation under the letter
    of credit to act independently of the underlying relationships between it and
    its customer, or between its customer and the beneficiary, has been
    compromised.  As the Baxter and Sarna
    texts cited above both affirm, the obligation of the issuing bank must be
    carried out <i>irrespective of any dispute</i> between the buyer and seller or <i>between
    bank and customer</i>.  Here, the trial
    judge found that CIBC permitted its conflicting concern respecting its
    financial over-exposure in the creditor/debtor relationship with Robertson, to interfere
    with its payment obligation to Thai Fisheries under the Letters of Credit.  In these circumstances, the issuing Bank was
    not entitled to permit those conflicting interests to prevail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although there appear to be very few authorities
    where the question of <i>the issuing bank’s</i> own conduct in advancing its own interests at the expense of the beneficiary
    has been in issue, the following decisions are helpful by way of analogy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>E &amp;
    H Partners</i>, the issuing bank, Broadway National, took the position that it
    did not have to honour a standby letter of credit issued in favour of E &amp; H
    Partners because the documentation submitted by the beneficiary did not conform
    to the terms of the credit.  The Bank was
    found to be estopped from asserting nonconformity, however, because it had
    improperly consulted and colluded with its customer, Astro International,
    regarding the decision not to honour the letter of credit – beyond any
    permissible discussion regarding the possible waiver of discrepancies.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[11]</span></span></span></a>  The U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York held that this conduct was both a breach of the autonomy/independence
    concept and a violation of the issuer’s duty of good faith.  Broadway National was estopped from claiming
    non-conformance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.  At pp. 284-285, the Court stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, it is clear in this case that the purpose
    of the multiple communications between Broadway National and Astro regarding
    the letter of credit was not to discuss waiver of the alleged
    discrepancies.  In fact, the opposite
    seems to be true.  It appears from the
    record that Astro played an active part in the bank’s initial decision to
    dishonour E &amp; H’s draft.  Not only
    did Astro repeatedly urge Broadway National to dishonour the draft, it also
    hired a lawyer to find errors in E &amp; H’s submissions.  <span class=StyleItalic><i>This type of
    communication between the issuing bank and the payor of the letter of credit
    cannot be allowed.  First, such contact
    clearly violates the independence principle inherent in the UCP and in letter
    of credit law</i></span><i>.  <span class=StyleItalic>A bank has an independent
    obligation to the beneficiary; to permit the payor to pressure or </span><u>collude
    with the bank</u><span class=StyleItalic> to dishonour the draft destroys the
    very principle upon which the commercial utility of letters of credit rests</span></i>. <span class=StyleItalic><i>See</i></span><i> <span class=StyleItalic>Voest-Alpine Int’l Corp</span>., <span
class=StyleItalic>707 F.2d at 682</span> </i>(“Since the great utility of
    letters of credit arises from the independent obligation of the issuing bank,
    attempts to <span class=StyleItalic><i>avoid payment premised on extrinsic
    considerations</i></span> – contrary to the instruments’ formal documentary
    nature – tend to compromise their chief virtue of predictable reliability as a
    payment mechanism.”) ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Furthermore, under the
    law of New York, letters of credit, like other written contracts, imply good
    faith and fair dealing.  <span
class=StyleItalic><i>See Clark Oil Trading Co. v. J. Aron and Co., 172 Misc. 2d

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To a similar effect is the decision of the Court
    of Appeal of California in <i>DBJJJ</i>.  Although the main issue in that case was
    whether the issuer was precluded from raising discrepancies in the documentation
    presented by the beneficiary because the issuer had failed to provide timely
    notice of its refusal to dishonour the documents, the court also concluded that
    the bank and the buyer had improperly colluded together to dishonour the claim,
    relying upon <i>E &amp; H Partners </i>to do
    so.  With respect to the seller’s
    argument that the issuer bank had improperly colluded with the buyer, the Court
    explained, at p. 544:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, the contact
    with the Applicant is not justifiable if it is designed to allow the Issuing Bank
    and the Applicant to make a joint decision on the discrepant documents.  The decision to honor or refuse the documents
    must be the Issuing Bank’s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, in <i>Lectrodryer
    v. SeoulBank</i>, the Court of Appeal for California permitted Lectrodryer, the
    beneficiary under a letter of credit, to recover on unjust enrichment grounds
    notwithstanding arguments based on non-compliant documentary presentation.  Lectrodryer had manufactured and delivered a
    molecular sieve dryer used in refining oil into gasoline to its buyer, a
    California exporter of industrial equipment.  The purchase price of $493,000 was to be paid by irrevocable letter of
    credit.  SeoulBank issued the letter of
    credit in favour of Lectrodryer at the request of the buyer, one of its largest
    customers, but a customer that was in serious financial difficulties at the
    time.  SeoulBank insisted on payment up
    front from the buyer in the amount to be paid under the letter of credit – an
    amount which the buyer was able to provide from the proceeds of sale of the
    dryer because it had pre-sold the equipment to a Japanese company at a
    significant profit.  Certain other
    cheques provided to SeoulBank by the customer – in approximately the same
    amount – bounced, however.  When
    Lectrodryer submitted its documentation, SeoulBank asserted there were fatal
    discrepancies and, despite waiver of the discrepancies by the buyer, refused to
    pay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the discrepancies, and the
    argument that the letter of credit had expired before presentation of the
    documentation, the California Court of Appeal upheld Lectrodryer’s claim.  It did <span class=GramE>so on</span> two
    grounds.  First, it rejected SeoulBank’s
    argument that the cause of action for unjust enrichment was an impermissible
    attempt to enforce a letter of credit indirectly by resort to equity.  The Court stated, at p. 726, that “<span
lang=EN-US>even accepting the premise that a
    bank’s obligation to pay a letter of credit is determined by applying strict
    legal guidelines to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit without
    reference to equitable principles, such premise is irrelevant here” (citations
    omitted).  SeoulBank was unjustly
    enriched when it retained for itself the funds the buyer used to purchase the
    letter of credit for the purpose of paying Lectrodryer.  Secondly – even if letter of credit
    principles applied to the case and the <span class=GramE>claim for unjust
    enrichment were</span> rejected – the Court held that SeoulBank had waived any
    right to rely of notions of strict compliance as a result of its dealings with
    the buyer with respect to payment under the letter credit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is little Canadian authority that I have
    been able to find touching the type of situation presented by the case before
    us.  However, in <i>Morguard </i>the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench applied equitable
    principles of waiver and estoppel – as did the foregoing American authorities –
    to permit recovery by the beneficiary of a letter of credit, in spite of
    documentary non-compliance and expiry of the credit.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At issue in <i>Morguard</i> was a standby letter of credit provided by Royal Bank to secure the performance
    of the terms of certain mortgages.  Default occurred under the mortgages but there was a dispute as to
    whether the demand letters submitted to the Bank under the letter of credit
    properly described the lands covered by the mortgages.  The trial judge agreed that the demand
    letters were not in compliance with the terms of the letter of credit.  However, he permitted the beneficiary to
    recover on equitable grounds.<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[12]</span></span></span></a>  At p. 117, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question of expiry
    of the letter of credit was never raised until after that expiry date
    passed.  In reliance upon these
    representations Morguard, to its detriment, did not deliver an acceptable
    letter of presentation within the time when the bank would still have
    paid.  It would be inequitable for the bank
    to be allowed to withhold payment of the moneys in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have little difficulty in applying the themes
    emerging from the foregoing authorities to the circumstances of this case. Those
    themes are rooted in the failure to comply with the principle of autonomy and
    independence, buttressed by principles of equity and fairness, including the
    U.S. duty of good faith.  Whether the
    purpose of the joint participation between bank and customer is to reject
    discrepant documents with a view to advancing the customer’s interests (as in <i>E &amp; H Partners</i> and <i>DBJJ</i>) or to thwart the very presentation
    of the requisite documentation in the first place in order to advance the
    interests of both bank and customer by reducing the customer’s indebtedness to
    the bank (as in the case before us), or whether broader equitable principles
    are being applied (as with unjust enrichment in <i>Lectrodryer</i> and <i>Morguard</i>)
    makes little difference, it seems to me.  The inappropriate character of the issuing bank’s conduct is the same:
    it places its interest as lender ahead of its duty as contracting party under
    the letters of credit, thereby interfering with the guiding principle of
    autonomy and independence, as well as the contractual duty of good faith (to
    which I will return momentarily).  I
    agree with Mr. Berkow’s submission that, in the circumstances of this case, the
    use of the Letters of Credit by the issuer and its customer as a tap for
    payment, depending upon when the Bank and its client wanted to effect such
    payment – in order to better their own positions <i>vis-à-vis </i>each other as debtor and creditor – nullifies the entire
    autonomy principle and the independent role required of the Bank under the
    Letters of Credit.</p>
  <h3>Good Faith</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jurisprudence cited above, together with
    principles of equity and the underlying terms and conditions to be found in UCP
    500, all justify the trial judge’s findings respecting a direct violation of
    the doctrines of autonomy and independence.  Furthermore, Canadian jurisprudence supports his finding of an implied
    duty of good faith in the performance of the Letters of Credit in the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Canadian law has not yet recognized a
    stand-alone “duty of good faith” in the performance of a contract that is
    independent from the terms of the contract, as the United States has done, the
    jurisprudence establishes that there is an implied contractual duty of good
    faith not to act in a way that defeats or eviscerates the very purpose and
    objective of the agreement: see <i>Transamerica
    Life Canada Inc. v. ING Canada Inc.</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 457 (C.A.), at
    paras. 53 and 87; <i>GATX Corp. v. Hawker

    Law, 2005), at p. 792.  The trial judge
    was correct, in my view, in holding that the Letters of Credit were infused
    with an implied duty of good faith of that nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>His conclusion in that regard is well-supported
    on the record.  As the Bank contends, and
    the trial judge found, the 1994 letters of credit were structured in such a way
    that Thai Fisheries ceded control over the timing of documentary compliance –
    and thus the timing of payment – to Robertson and Sam’s Club, and, indirectly,
    to the Bank.  I say “indirectly to the
    Bank” because, as Mr. Purvis acknowledged in his internal memorandum dated July
    14, 1994:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The terms of payment
    of the L/C’s based on the presentation of delivery receipts <span
class=StyleItalic><i>allows </i></span><i><u>us
    and the client</u><span class=StyleItalic> to control the release of funds and
    therefore we can control our actual exposure within the US $15 MM facility</span></i>.  Payments under the L/C’s will therefore be
    tied to cash flow. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is precisely what happened when the Bank
    became concerned about its exposure on the Robertson indebtedness.  It gave the Bank the opportunity to exert
    what was tantamount to a discretionary control over documentary compliance and
    the timing of payment to Thai Fisheries.  Contracts in which performance is dependent upon the exercise of
    discretion on the part of one of the parties are contracts that are
    particularly characterized by the implied duty of good faith performance.  In such circumstances, the discretion must be
    exercised reasonably and in good faith: see <i>CivicLife.com</i> at para. 49; <i>Greenberg v. Meffert </i>at
    p. 763; McCamus at p. 788.<b>  </b></p>

    performance of a contract may be found where there is “evidence that some sort
    of bad motive – <i>such as self-interest</i>,
    ill will or a dishonest purpose – underlay a decision” (emphasis added): <i>Hembruff v. Ontario Municipal Employees
    Retirement Board</i> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 561 (C.A.), at para 116.  Here, the Bank acted out of self-interest, as
    the trial judge found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ultimately found that CIBC had
    breached its contractual obligations to Thai Fisheries both directly (by
    descending into the arena and participating in the arrangement with Robertson
    to frustrate the Special Conditions and using that non-compliance to refuse
    payment, while nonetheless applying the proceeds from the sale of shrimp
    supplied under the Letters of Credit to reduce Robertson’s overdraft) and
    indirectly (by breaching an implied contractual duty of good faith not to act
    in a way that defeated the purpose of the contract).  Having reached those conclusions, he was
    entirely justified in rejecting CIBC’s attempts to rely upon the doctrine of
    strict compliance.</p>
  <h3>Risk Allocation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Bank argues, nonetheless, that by accepting
    the Special Conditions in the Letters of Credit, Thai Fisheries accepted the
    risk of non-payment if Sam’s Club failed to take up all of the shrimp or to
    provide the Receipts, or if Robertson acted dishonestly.  The Bank points out that Thai Fisheries opted
    to take no security from Robertson and, as noted above, ceded control over the
    timing of payments to Robertson (and, indirectly, to the Bank).  The Bank therefore relies on what it says is
    clear law respecting the allocation of risk in letters of credit transaction:
    the risk falls on the supplier who accepts the letter of credit as written –
    and therefore must examine and either accept or reject the credit in advance –
    even where performance turns out to be impossible: see <i>Tradax Petroleum </i>at p. 833.  In <i>Mutual Export</i>, the U.S.
    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit explained, at p. 423: “The law in
    disputes such as this one is clear: The beneficiary must inspect the letter of
    credit and is responsible for any negligent failure to discover that <i>the credit does not achieve the desired
    commercial ends</i>” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, none of the allocation-of-risk cases are
    situations in which “the credit [did] not achieve the desired commercial ends”
    because the issuer and its customer colluded to undermine the very purpose of
    the letter of credit and to undermine the principle of autonomy and
    independence, as the trial judge found to be the case here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, acceptance of the Letters of Credit
    with the Special Conditions in them did not eradicate CIBC’s obligation to
    adhere to the principle of autonomy and independence and to its implied duty of
    good faith in the performance of its obligations under the Letters of
    Credit.  At most, it cast the Bank’s
    obligations to be carried out in the crucible of those Special Conditions.  Nor did it have the effect of transferring to
    Thai Fisheries the risk of collusion between the Bank and its customer in a way
    that violated those obligations, as CIBC contends.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thai Fisheries did indeed agree to assume the
    risk of delayed acceptance of the shrimp and delayed payment by Sam’s Club and,
    therefore, of delayed delivery of the Receipts and delayed payment to it under
    the Letters of Credit.  It agreed to
    accept the risk that Sam’s Club would not take up all of the shrimp – although
    in such a case, the terms of the Letters of Credit did not permit the Bank to
    release the documents of title respecting the unaccepted shrimp to Robertson
    because that shrimp would not be for delivery to Sam’s Club.  It agreed to accept the risk, even, that
    Robertson would act dishonestly and fail, for whatever reason, to provide the
    Receipts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But Thai Fisheries did not assume the risk that <i>CIBC</i> – the issuer of the Letters of
    Credit – would participate in a ploy with Robertson, its customer, to frustrate
    compliance with the Special Conditions, then rely upon such non-compliance to
    deny payment under the Letters of Credit, while at the same time knowingly
    accepting the proceeds from the sale of the very shrimp shipped under those
    Letters of Credit, to improve its lending position <i>vis-à-vis</i> its customer.  To
    interpret the Letters of Credit in a way that would give credence to the view
    that Thai Fisheries agreed to accept such a risk would be – as the trial judge
    said – to render the Letters of Credit commercially meaningless.  It is well-established that “[w]here … the
    document to be construed is a negotiated commercial document, the court should
    avoid an interpretation that would result in a commercial absurdity.  Rather, the document should be construed in
    accordance with sound commercial principles and good business sense” (footnotes
    omitted): <i>Kentucky Fried Chicken Canada v. Scott’s Food Services Inc.</i>, (1998)

  <h3>Conclusions Regarding Strict Compliance Defence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, then, CIBC is simply disentitled to
    rely upon the defence of strict compliance.  That is so because by its conduct in participating with its customer, Robertson,
    in an arrangement that prevented the delivery of the Receipts from Sam’s Club
    for Thai Fisheries’ shrimp (or from others to whom the shrimp was sold), CIBC
    permitted its conflicting interest as a secured lender of the buyer to
    influence and interfere with its contractual obligation to Thai Fisheries as
    beneficiary under the Letters of Credit.  However, in this case, the Bank was driven by its desire to eliminate
    its existing exposure on the Robertson indebtedness (which it succeeded in
    doing just prior to Robertson’s bankruptcy); its motive was to resolve a
    dispute between it and its customer.  This, it was not permitted to do at the expense of the beneficiary, when
    it was in part its own conduct that generated the documentary non-compliance it
    relied on to justify non-payment under the Letters of Credit.  As Respondent’s counsel put it – bluntly and
    succinctly – in their factum, at para. 1: “CIBC cannot hide behind the
    principle of strict compliance in circumstances where, by its own conduct, it
    thwarted such compliance and defeated Thai’s rights under the Letter of
    Credit.”  It would simply be inequitable
    to permit it to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully, the trial judge was correct in
    disposing of the case on these bases.  His
    resolution transcends the rigour and technicalities of strict compliance in
    letter of credit law, but is justified in the particular circumstances of this
    case because it in no way interferes with the uniqueness of letter of credit
    transactions.  Had the trial judge not made
    the factual findings he did, the result might be quite different.  However, the trial judge made the following
    crucial findings, amongst others:</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>a)  CIBC knew Sam’s Club had accepted shrimp
    valued at $6.9 million and delivered by Thai Fisheries under the Letters of
    Credit, but there were no Receipts for those purchases; and</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>b)  CIBC had a signed undertaking from Robertson
    to deliver the Receipts from Sam’s Club to the Bank (recall that the undertaking
    was said to be an “amendment” to the Letter of Credit);<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[13]</span></span></span></a> but nonetheless</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>c)  CIBC “closed its eyes to the prospect that
    [the Receipts] ought to exist and then accepted from the buyer in payment of
    its debt, money that might otherwise be owing to the seller;” and, moreover,</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>d)  CIBC acted “carelessly, recklessly or
    knowingly” in accepting the proceeds of sale from Robertson and in permitting
    Robertson to put those proceeds “to its own use to the benefit of the CIBC;” </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>e)  With respect to the balance of the Thai
    Fisheries’ shrimp, CIBC was “party to an arrangement to sell shrimp to others
    [that it knew] should be subject to the [Receipts]”, thus ensuring that it
    would be “impossible for the conditions in the Letters of Credit to be met”;
    and in that respect</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>f)  CIBC “worked actively to defeat the payments
    to Thai Fisheries that CIBC would, if those conditions had been met, have been
    obliged to make”; and finally,</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'>g)  Although
    CIBC was precluded from involving itself in the contractual relationship
    between the buyer and the seller, it did exactly that, in its role as lender, thereby
    “[breaching] its separate and independent responsibilities to the seller under
    the Letters of Credit” by “[entering] into the issue and, without advising the
    seller, [acting] with the buyer so that the shrimp was sold to others and the
    money used to pay off the buyer’s debt to the CIBC.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These findings were all amply supported on the
    evidence and are unassailable.  They are
    fatal to CIBC’s position in the action. </p>
  <h3>Timely Notice of Dishonour</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is an additional basis that the trial
    judge could have used to support his decision, in my opinion, but did not.  The issuer of a letter of credit has an
    obligation to give timely notice that it is refusing to pay when it is
    asserting non-compliance.  CIBC failed to
    comply with this obligation when it failed to notify Thai Fisheries for more
    than a year after it first learned from Robertson that the Receipts requirement
    would not be fulfilled.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both custom and the provisions of the UCP 500
    impose on the issuer of a letter of credit a duty to give timely notice of
    dishonour.  This duty is the flip side of
    the strict compliance coin: see <i>Morguard</i> at paras. 56-60, citing <i>Paramount Export
    Company v. Asia Trust Bank, Ltd</i>., 193 Cal. App. 3d 1474 (Cal. Ct. App.
    1987), at p. 1482; <i>Bank of Cochlin</i> at
    p. 212.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Articles 13(b) and 14(d) and (e) of the UCP 500 provide,
    amongst other things, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>13(b) The Issuing Bank … shall … have a reasonable
    time, not to exceed seven banking days following the day of the receipt of the
    documents, to examine the documents and determine whether to take up or refuse
    the documents and to inform the party from which it received the documents
    accordingly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>14(d) (i) If
    the Issuing Bank … decides to refuse the documents, it must give notice to that
    effect … without delay but no later than the close of the seventh banking day
    following the day of receipt of the documents...</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii) Such notice must state all discrepancies
    in respect of which the bank refuses the documents and must also state <span
class=GramE>whether  it</span> is holding
    the documents at the disposal of, or is returning them to, the presenter.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>14(e) If the Issuing
    Bank … fails to act in accordance with the provisions of this Article and/or
    fails to hold the documents at the disposal of, or return them to [the
    presenter] it shall be precluded from claiming that the documents are not in
    compliance with the terms and conditions of the Credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I need at this point to turn briefly to the
    issue of whether the provisions of the UCP 500 were incorporated by reference
    into the Letters of Credit here.  As I
    have noted above, the trial judge held they were not.  Respectfully, I am not persuaded that he was
    correct in so holding.  To repeat, the
    Letters of Credit included the following stipulation:  “This cable is the operative instrument <i>and subject to</i> the U.C.P. 1993 revision
    ICC Publication No. 500 and engages us in accordance with the terms thereof”
    (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Focusing on the last wording of this term – “and <i>engages us</i> in accordance with the
    terms thereof” – and after reviewing dictionary definitions of the word
    “engages”, the trial judge determined that the language was insufficient to
    incorporate the provisions of the UCP 500 into the Letters of Credit.  Instead, he concluded that the UCP 500
    “provides guidance to or presents a general framework to which the Letters of
    Credit are to conform” and that in fact “the general direction in UCP 500 has
    been conformed with.”  While it may be
    that not much turns on the distinction for purposes of the appeal, I do not
    agree.  It is apparent from the
    authorities and texts dealing with letters of credit that the parties
    customarily make their agreement subject to the Uniform Customs, i.e., they
    incorporate the UCP into the letter of credit by reference: see Sarna at pp.
    2-25 and 2-27.  The wording “subject to
    the UCP” appears to have been considered sufficient for these purposes.  See e.g. <i>Morguard</i> at p. 117; <i>Bank of Cochlin</i> at p. 210.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, the trial judge concentrated on the
    wording “engages us” to the exclusion of the clear language that the Letters of
    Credit were “subject to” the UCP 500 and <i>thus</i> “engaged” the parties in accordance with its terms.  When the words “engages us in accordance with
    the terms thereof” are read together with the “subject to” language of the
    provision – and when they are considered in the context of what appears to be
    the prevailing custom of referring to the Uniform Customs in letters of credit
    – the only interpretation that makes sense is that the parties here intended by
    their language to incorporate the provisions of UCP 500 by reference into their
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This conclusion has two implications for the
    appeal.  First, it places the
    underpinnings of the American authorities referred to above on a more or less
    equal footing with the Letters of Credit at issue on the appeal.  Secondly, it opens the door to the further
    basis for disentitling CIBC to rely upon its defence of non-compliance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The provisions of the UCP 500 cited above, and
    the authorities referred to, deal with situations in which the issuing bank is
    responding to the documentation presented in support of the intended draw-down
    on the letter of credit.  Here, there is
    a distinction from such circumstances because the required documentation was
    not all presented for review by the Bank.  However, I see no difference in principle, for purposes of the issuer’s
    responsibility to provide timely notification of its intention not to honour
    the draw.  The purpose of requiring the
    issuer to provide prompt notification of dishonour is to enable the notified
    party to respond by curing the discrepancies, if possible, or otherwise
    protecting its interests: see <i>Morguard</i> at p. 117; <i>Paramount Export </i>at 1482;<b> </b><i>Bank
    of Cochin</i> at p. 213.  In <i>Morguard</i>, the court ruled that the
    beneficiary did not deliver an acceptable letter of presentation within the
    appropriate time limits because it relied on representations made by the
    issuer.  In <i>Bank of Cochlin</i>, the issuer’s delay prevented the confirming bank
    from taking steps expeditiously to recover funds before they had been removed
    from the fraudster beneficiary’s account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, the Bank was aware by July 7, 1995, that
    the Receipts from Sam’s Club and Robertson would not be forthcoming.  It had before it at the time Thai Fisheries’
    draws on the Letters of Credit, awaiting delivery of those Receipts.  Yet it did not notify its beneficiary that it
    could not honour the draws because there would be no documentary
    compliance.  Nor did it take any steps to
    enforce Robertson’s undertaking to provide those Receipts for $6.9 million
    worth of shrimp that it knew Sam’s Club had accepted from Thai Fisheries’
    supply.  Nor did it cancel the Letters of
    Credit until October 1996 – some 15 months later – after Thai Fisheries’ shrimp
    had all been sold.  The prejudice to Thai
    Fisheries in these circumstances is clear: it was deprived of the opportunity to
    take any steps to protect its interests by demanding the return of the title
    documents and/or taking court proceedings – as Robertson’s other supplier,
    Magnate had successfully done – to seize the remaining shrimp.  The trial judge found that Thai Fisheries had
    been “misled into believing that [the Receipts] might still be forthcoming.”  The inference is irresistible that the Bank’s
    silence in this regard was motivated by its desire, and Robertson’s, to ensure
    that Thai Fisheries took no Magnate-like steps until Robertson’s indebtedness
    had been paid down from the proceeds of sale of the shrimp.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CIBC is not entitled to rely upon non-compliance
    with the Special Conditions in such circumstances.</p>
  <h3>The Passing of Title</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, CIBC argues that the trial judge erred
    in determining that title to the shrimp had not passed to Robertson upon the
    delivery of the bills of lading and shipping documents to the Bank by Thai
    Fisheries’s Bangkok bankers or, at least, upon the delivery of those documents
    to Robertson under the Letters of Credit.  The Bank submits that title did pass and that two things flow from this
    for purposes of the appeal.  First,
    Robertson owned the shrimp and was therefore free to sell it and to use its own
    funds to pay down its line of credit at the Bank.  Secondly, once title had changed hands to
    Robertson, the Bank itself acquired an interest in the shrimp as a secured
    lender of Robertson – in priority to Thai Fisheries’ interest as an unsecured
    creditor of Robertson – and therefore was justified in its actions on the basis
    that it was simply exercising its rights as a secured creditor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The ownership argument is, in my view,
    misconceived.  Like the trial judge, I do
    not think it matters for purposes of the disposition of this action whether
    title passed, or did not pass, to Robertson.  CIBC’s rights as a secured creditor are irrelevant. As the trial judge
    noted,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] <span class=GramE>change</span> in ownership at
    the time of the delivery of the documents would not relieve the CIBC of the
    obligations it had to Thai Fisheries following from the independent contractual
    link between the CIBC and Thai Fisheries arising from the Letters of Credit it
    issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree.  Contrary to the Bank’s submissions, Thai
    Fisheries is not seeking to re-transfer the risk of Robertson’s default in
    payment from itself to the Bank, thereby usurping the Bank’s position as
    secured creditor.  Thai Fisheries is not
    seeking to assert its rights as an unsecured creditor of Robertson at all.  As noted above, it is seeking to enforce its
    contractual rights against the Bank under the Letters of Credit.  CIBC’s secured rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> Robertson and Robertson’<span lang=EN-US>s unsecured creditors do not trump its
    contractual obligations to Thai Fisheries – and the principles of autonomy and
    independence that infuse those obligations – under the Letters of Credit.  It cannot breach its obligations, including
    its implied duty of good faith, by acting in a way that defeats the purpose of
    the credit, and then seek to take cover behind its status as a secured
    creditor, under an entirely separate contractual arrangement with its customer,
    to immunize it from breach of its Letter of Credit obligations.  </span></p>
  <h3>CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal raises the interesting – and
    difficult – question of the role, if any, to be played by principles of
    fairness and equity in letter of credit transactions.  Given the uniqueness and importance of
    letters of credit as a mechanism for the financing of commercial transactions
    worldwide, as much certainty as possible in their interpretation and application
    is essential.  That is not to say,
    however, that principles of fairness and equity play no role in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When judges and legal writers say that letters
    of credit operate independently of the equities, they may mean “independently
    of the equities surrounding the performance of the underlying contracts” (a
    proposition about which there can be no doubt – the <i>quid pro quo</i> principles of autonomy and independence, on the one
    hand, and strict compliance with the documentary requirements and terms of the
    letter of credit, on the other hand, ensure that result).  Or they may mean “independent of equitable
    considerations in favour of the beneficiary where the beneficiary has accepted
    the terms of the credit but cannot meet the terms of compliance” (a proposition
    that generally follows from the autonomy/strict compliance dichotomy).  As the jurisprudence and basic principles of
    fairness and equity show, however, the latter proposition cannot always carry
    the day.  This is one of those
    cases.  </p>

    Fisheries continued to deliver shrimp to Robertson until at least June
    1995.  These shipments were done under
    “documents against payment” and “documents against acceptance”, which are
    financing mechanisms similar to letters of credit but without the same level of
    security provided to the seller. The shipments under these arrangements are not
    in issue on the appeal. </p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'> On appeal, the Alberta Court of Appeal arrived at the
    same result, but on a different basis.  The appeal court concluded that there had been documentary compliance in
    the circumstances.  Accordingly, it found
    it unnecessary to consider whether the beneficiary could rely on waiver or
    estoppel or untimely notice of dishonour on the part of the bank. It did not
    say the trial judge had erred in applying those principles.  The judgment was varied accordingly.</span></p>

    to as “the original structure” of the Letters of Credit, and the Bank could not
    turn a blind eye to it in the circumstances.</p>
