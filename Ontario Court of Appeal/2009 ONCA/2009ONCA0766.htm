  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that if certain conditions are met, the results of a breathalyser test
    constitute conclusive proof of the concentration of alcohol in an accused
    person’s blood, both at the time of the test and at the time when the offence
    was alleged to have been committed.  One
    of these conditions is set by s. 258(1)(c)(iii).  It requires that each sample be “received
    from the accused directly into an approved container or into an approved
    instrument operated by a qualified technician”.  The meaning of this requirement, particularly the meaning of “directly”,
    and the evidence needed to satisfy it are at the heart of this appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At about 2:30 a.m. on October 16, 2005, Frank Mulroney,
    the respondent in this appeal, was observed by the police driving his vehicle
    erratically, weaving from side to side.  The police stopped him and administered a roadside breath test which he
    failed.  He was then arrested, charged
    with impaired driving and driving with more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of
    blood, and taken to the police station for a breathalyser test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P.C. Fawcett administered the test.  He gave evidence at trial that he has been a
    qualified breath technician since 1991, that the instrument he used that night
    was the Intoxilyzer 5000C, that is designed to receive and analyze breath
    samples for blood alcohol concentration, that it appeared to be working
    properly, that the respondent blew into the mouth-piece of the instrument as
    instructed, and that this provided a suitable sample for analysis for both the
    first and second tests that he administered.  He was not cross-examined on these parts of his evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the Crown’s case, the respondent
    moved successfully to dismiss the charge of impaired driving.  The respondent then moved to have the “over
    80” charge dismissed for want of evidence, arguing that there was no evidence
    that his breath sample went directly into the breathalyser and that s.
    258(1)(c)(iii) was therefore not complied with.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed this motion, finding that
    there was evidence sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude that the breath
    sample indeed went directly into the instrument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence then called evidence that went only to the
    respondent’s consumption of alcohol and the effect this consumption would have
    on the concentration of alcohol in his blood.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge convicted the respondent.  He concluded that, since there was nothing to
    suggest that there was anything wrong in the preparation or use of the approved
    breathalyser instrument, and since he could not accept the respondent’s
    evidence of what alcohol he had consumed that night, the Crown had proved the
    charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  He
    imposed a fine of $800 and a 12-month driving prohibition on the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent appealed.  The summary conviction appeal court judge
    held that there was no evidence that the mouth-piece was connected to the
    Intoxilyzer or, even if it was, that there was no intervening apparatus between
    the two.  Consequently, he concluded that
    there was no evidence that could properly lead to a reasonable inference that
    the breath samples were provided by the respondent <i>directly</i> into the approved instrument, and that the trial judge
    erred in not allowing the application for a non-suit.  He allowed the appeal, set aside the
    conviction, and entered an acquittal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown now seeks leave to appeal, and to appeal, if
    leave is granted.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown makes two arguments in this court.  First, it says that as a matter of statutory
    interpretation, s. 258(1)(c)(iii) does not require that a breath sample be
    received from an accused directly into an approved instrument in order to make
    the evidence of the results of the analysis conclusive proof of the
    concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood.  That section is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="anchorse:258-ss:_1_"></a>258. (1) In any
    proceedings under subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under
    section 253 or subsection 254(5) or in any proceedings under any of subsections
    255(2) to (3.2),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand
    made under subsection 254(3), if</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii) each sample was received from the accused
    directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument operated by
    a qualified technician …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>evidence of the results of the analyses so made is
    conclusive proof that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood both
    at the time when the analyses were made and at the time when the offence was
    alleged to have been committed was, if the results of the analyses are the
    same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, if the results of the
    analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations determined by the
    analyses, in the absence of evidence tending to show all of the following three
    things — that the approved instrument was malfunctioning or was operated
    improperly, that the malfunction or improper operation resulted in the
    determination that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood exceeded
    80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood, and that the concentration of alcohol in
    the accused’s blood would not in fact have exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL
    of blood at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The definition of “approved container” in respect of
    breath samples is found at s. 254(1) of the <i>Code</i>.  It requires that the container be of a kind that
    is approved as suitable for the purposes of s. 258 by order of the Attorney
    General of Canada.  Counsel advises that
    there have been no such orders made, and therefore, there are at present no
    approved containers.  The same section
    also defines “approved instrument”.  There
    is no dispute that the breathalyser used in this case meets that
    definition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the summary conviction appeal
    court judge erred in reading s. 258(1)(c)(iii) to require evidence of the
    breath sample being received directly into the approved instrument.  Its argument is simply that on the wording of
    the legislation, “directly” applies only if the breath sample is being received
    into an approved container, but when it is being received into an approved
    instrument there is no such constraint.  Indeed, the Crown says that the section provides no constraint at all on
    how the breath sample gets into an approved instrument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown looks for support to <i>R. v. Thomas</i> (1981), 10 M.V.R. 182 (Ont. H.C.), where at p. 186 Steele
    J. states this about what is now s. 258(1)(c)(iii):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is my opinion that the word directly relates
    only to an approved container and does not refer or relate to an approved
    instrument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, in <i>R. v. Alatyppo,</i> (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 514, this court found the
    opposite.  While the meaning of
    “directly” was not the contested issue in that case, Martin J.A. writing for
    the court stated this at p. 518:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In order to have the benefit of the presumption
    that the proportion of alcohol in the accused’s blood at the time when the
    offence is alleged to have been committed is the proportion determined by the
    chemical analysis of the samples of breath taken, the Crown must establish that
    the breath samples were received from the accused directly into an approved
    instrument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there are several reasons to reject the
    Crown’s position that s. 258(1)(c)(iii) provides no constraints at all on the
    way a breath sample must be received into an approved instrument, and to instead
    apply the words of Martin J.A. to the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the section provides the Crown with proof that
    is deemed conclusive of the concentration of alcohol in an accused’s blood, I
    think that the liberty interest of the accused requires a strict interpretation
    of the section.  The same strict approach
    also serves the objective of preserving the integrity of the breath sample in
    order to ensure accurate results.  On the
    other hand, implicit in the section is the contemplation that a breath sample
    could properly be received into an approved instrument not directly from an
    accused, but from an approved container, if there were any.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With these considerations in mind, I think the proper
    interpretation of s. 258(1)(c)(iii) is that the breath sample from the accused
    must be received into an approved instrument either from an approved container
    if one is used, or, if not, directly into the approved instrument itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The latter circumstance exists here as it did in <i>R. v. Alatyppo</i>.  Thus, here I think the Crown had to establish
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the breath samples were received into the
    approved instrument directly from the accused.  The Crown’s first argument therefore fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s second argument is that the trial judge was
    correct to find that there was evidence sufficient for a trier of fact to
    conclude that the appellant’s breath sample was received directly into the
    approved instrument, and then to go on to do so in convicting him.  The Crown submits that the summary conviction
    appeal court judge erred in finding that there was no evidence that could
    properly lead to that inference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with these submissions.  Here there was not just evidence that the
    breathalyser used was an approved instrument and a result was obtained.  Nor did the trial judge simply take judicial
    notice that this must mean that the breath sample was received directly into
    the instrument.  P.C. Fawcett testified
    that the instrument was designed to receive and analyse breath samples, that it
    appeared to be working properly, that the respondent blew into the mouth-piece
    of the instrument as instructed, and that this provided a suitable sample for
    analysis.  None of this evidence was
    contested by the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this was ample circumstantial evidence from
    which the trial judge could properly conclude as he did, namely that the
    respondent’s breath samples were received directly into the approved instrument
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore grant leave, allow the appeal and
    restore the order of the trial judge.</p>
