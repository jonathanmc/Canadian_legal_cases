  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant brings this motion for an order pursuant
    to s. 683(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>requiring that a witness be made available for
    cross-examination.  The appellant
    presents certain new information that he will seek to introduce as fresh
    evidence on his appeal from conviction for sexual assault.  The witness the appellant seeks to
    cross-examine on that new information is his wife, Gurinder Sihota, the complainant and alleged victim of the
    sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charge arose from a series of acts allegedly
    committed between January 1, 2005, and February 16, 2007, while the parties
    were married.  The parties separated in
    October 2006. The appellant commenced divorce proceedings and the question of
    child custody and access quickly became an issue.  On January 10, 2007, the appellant obtained
    an <i>ex parte </i>order prohibiting his
    wife from leaving Waterloo Region with their daughter.  Ms. Sihota first complained to the police of
    sexual assault on January 27, 2007.  A family
    court order granted interim custody to both parents and continued to prohibit
    either party from removing their daughter from the region.  The parties’ second child was born on April 2,
    2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Credibility was the central issue at trial.  The Crown called only one witness, the
    complainant Gurinder Sihota.  The appellant
    testified in his own defence, denied ever having abused his wife, and took the
    position that the complainant’s allegations were fabricated in order to secure
    custody of their children and allow her to relocate to British Columbia where
    her family resided.  The complainant
    denied that her allegations of abuse were the product of the custody dispute
    and testified that she wanted the appellant to have a continuing relationship
    with the children.  The trial judge
    expressed certain concerns with the appellant’s evidence but stated that those
    concerns “were not sufficient to warrant a rejection of his evidence when it is
    viewed on its own.”  However, the trial
    judge accepted the evidence of the complainant, did not accept the appellant’s
    evidence, and found that the appellant’s evidence did not raise a reasonable
    doubt. In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge specifically rejected the
    appellant’s claim that the allegations had been fabricated to support the
    custody claim:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence argues that
    she had motive to fabricate her story, i.e. issues of custody and wanting to
    move from the province but I find that is not the case. Indeed, she was more
    than fair in her assessment of Mr. Sihota. She clearly indicated in her
    evidence with some emotion that she wants Mr. Sihota to have a relationship
    with their children.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The facts simply do not support that submission.
    She wished simply to go to her family in B.C. or her relative in Brampton to
    get assistance while she was about to give birth to her second child. I accept
    her evidence that she does not wish to terminate any relationship the father
    might have with their children, and if fact seems very willing to promote that
    relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault on June
    23, 2008 and sentenced on October 8, 2008 to imprisonment of two years less a
    day to be followed by three years probation.  He was released on bail pending appeal on October 16, 2008.  On October 27, 2008, Ms. Sihota filed a motion
    to vary the interim custody order to terminate the appellant’s access and to
    allow her to remove the children from the jurisdiction.  For the first time, she alleged that the
    appellant had sexually assaulted his daughter.  She sought an order in the family court
    proceedings terminating the appellant’s access and granting her permission to
    leave the jurisdiction.  The appellant
    denied the new allegations.  The
    complaint was investigated by the Childrens’ Aid authorities but no action was
    taken.  The Office of the Children’s
    Lawyer declined involvement in the matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Sihota’s motion was dismissed and the appellant’s
    cross motion for access to the younger daughter was granted.  Leave to appeal that decision was denied on
    December 24, 2008.  The Family Court
    custody proceedings continue and Ms. Sihota has not yet been cross-examined on
    her affidavits in part because she discharged her lawyer after notice for
    questioning had been served.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to have fresh evidence admitted on
    his appeal to show that the complainant’s post-conviction complaints and
    conduct demonstrate that, contrary to her evidence at trial and contrary to the
    trial judge’s finding, in making her allegations against him, Ms. Sihota was
    and is motivated by a desire to obtain custody of the children and leave the
    jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This application to cross-examine the complainant is
    supported by affidavits filed in the family court proceedings, correspondence,
    text messages and Family Court decisions.  In her affidavit filed after the appellant’s conviction in the custody
    proceedings, the wife states that she has denied access since the appellant’s
    conviction, that she “knew all along what he was capable of doing”, and that
    she considered it to be<i> </i>her
    responsibility to protect her children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the timing and
    substance of the post-conviction allegations show a continuing malicious intent
    on the part of the complainant to use the legal process to secure custody and
    deny the appellant access and that, if available at trial, this evidence would
    have assisted the defence in establishing her malicious intent, undermining her
    credibility and raising a reasonable doubt as to the truth of her accusation
    that the appellant had sexually assaulted her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The criteria governing the exercise of an appellate
    court’s power to receive fresh evidence is set out in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775:</p>
  <p class=Level1><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
    evidence will generally not be admitted if by due diligence it could have been
    adduced at trial;</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
    evidence must be relevant in the sense that it must bear upon a decisive, or
    potentially decisive, trial issue;</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
    evidence must be credible, in the sense that it must be reasonably capable of
    belief; and</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
    evidence must be such that, if believed, when taken with the other evidence
    adduced at the trial, it could reasonably be expected to have affected the
    result.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>In addition, the material must
    constitute admissible evidence that could have been adduced at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I express no view as to whether the proposed
    fresh evidence meets this standard at this preliminary stage, I do not accept
    the Crown’s submission that the fresh evidence application has no hope of
    success.  In my view, the application is
    arguable and the appellant should be allowed the opportunity to make his case
    before the panel hearing his appeal that the fresh evidence should be admitted
    and a new trial ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant’s motivation in relation to custody of
    the children was a central plank in the defence at trial.  The complainant denied that her allegations
    against the appellant were so motivated, and testified that she wanted him to
    maintain contact with the children. It is arguable that the complainant’s post-conviction
    allegations and her conduct in the custody proceedings are inconsistent with
    her evidence at trial and with the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s
    position.  The appellant faces the
    difficulty that the Crown insists that in its current form, the material
    proffered as fresh evidence is not admissible.  In addition, and in any event, the panel
    hearing the fresh evidence application would not be able to assess it properly
    without the benefit of a cross-examination of Ms. Sihota. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The powers conferred by s. 683 are “designed to
    maximize protection against wrongful convictions”: <i>R. v. Trotta </i>(2004), 23 C.R. (6<sup>th</sup>) 261 at para. 24. These
    powers were discussed by Gonthier J. in <i>R.
    v. Levesque</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487, at para. 25: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Determining the
    probative value of fresh evidence on appeal may be a difficult task, since the
    evidence has not been put to the test of cross-examination or rebuttal at
    trial.  Some courts of appeal express
    reluctance when they are asked to admit fresh evidence containing information
    which the adverse party has not been able to verify.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, where fresh evidence is challenged, or
    where its probative value is in dispute, it is desirable that it be tested
    before being admitted, primarily for two reasons:  (1) this facilitates the determination of the
    probative value of the fresh evidence, and (2) this is fairer to the party
    objecting to the admissions of the fresh evidence.<i> </i> This “testing” can be done
    in a number of ways…Courts of appeal may also…allow cross-examination of a
    witness or submission of expert evidence in response to fresh expert
    evidence.  In other words, they can do
    everything that the powers conferred on them by s. 683 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> permit them to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will only be in exceptional cases that an appellant
    who has been convicted of sexual assault should be afforded the opportunity to
    cross-examine the complainant in aid of a fresh evidence application on appeal.  The interests of complainants who have
    already testified and been cross-examined at trial must be carefully considered
    and respected.  They should not be forced
    to repeat the stress and trauma of the legal process unless clearly required by
    the interests of justice.  The scope of
    any examination should be carefully circumscribed and confined to what is fresh
    evidence.  The appellant should not be
    allowed to rehash ground covered at trial or to proceed on a speculative basis
    or “fishing expedition” to uncover fresh evidence not yet identified, but must
    show - to paraphrase the test for ordering Crown disclosure set out in <span
class=GramE><i>Trotta</i>  at</span> para. 25 - that there is some
    reasonable possibility that the cross-examination could assist on the motion to
    adduce fresh evidence by yielding material that will be admissible as fresh
    evidence, or assist the applicant in developing or obtaining material that will
    be admissible as fresh evidence.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, that standard has been met by the
    appellant.  While I express no view as to
    the likely outcome of the appellant’s fresh evidence application, it is my view
    that it is in the interests of justice that the appellant be allowed to present
    it with the benefit of an opportunity to cross-examine the complainant on her post-conviction
    allegations and conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, that cross-examination should be subject to
    certain limits to ensure that the rights and interests of the complainant are
    respected and that the cross-examination does not exceed the bounds of the
    appellant’s fresh evidence application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would order that the Crown make Ms.
