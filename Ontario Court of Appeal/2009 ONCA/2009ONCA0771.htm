  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of aggravated assault and
    sentenced to three years and four months imprisonment after credit for pre-trial
    custody.  Her appeal involves one issue:
    did the pre-trial <i>Charter</i> application
    judge err by dismissing her application for a stay on the ground that her s.
    11(b) <i>Charter</i> right “to be tried
    within a reasonable time”<span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>was
    infringed?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown alleged that the appellant, then 20 years
    old, tied up her boyfriend in their apartment while engaging in
    sado-masochistic sexual activity.  She
    left the room and David Schroeder, her former boyfriend, entered the apartment
    and inflicted multiple stab wounds upon the victim.  The Crown’s theory of the case was that the
    victim had abused the appellant and that she struck back by tying him up to
    facilitate the attack by Schroeder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case has a complex procedural history.  The appellant was arrested in <span
class=GramE>July  2002</span> and
    convicted more than five years later on November 16, 2007, after a 14 ½-day
    trial before judge and jury.  The
    appellant had been jointly charged with Schroeder with conspiracy to commit
    murder, attempted murder, and aggravated assault.  Following a lengthy preliminary inquiry, the
    preliminary inquiry judge committed Schroeder but discharged the appellant on
    all counts.  The Crown brought a <i>certiorari </i>application in the Superior
    Court to quash the appellant’s discharge.  The Superior Court judge granted <i>certiorari</i> and quashed the discharge, but rather than remitting the matter to the
    preliminary inquiry judge for further consideration, committed the appellant
    for trial on all counts.  The appellant
    appealed that order to this court.  In
    view of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Deschamplain</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 601 and <i>R. v. Sazant</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 635, rendered after the appeal had
    been launched, the appellant conceded that her discharge was infected by
    jurisdictional error and susceptible to review by way of <i>certiorari</i>.  However, the
    appellant argued that the Superior Court judge hearing the <i>certiorari</i> application had no authority to commit her for
    trial.  That argument was accepted by
    this court: (2005), 74 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.).  We found, at para. 22, that “the appropriate order in this case was to
    quash the discharge and remit the matter to the preliminary inquiry judge for
    further consideration on the whole of the evidence.”  The matter was accordingly remitted to the
    preliminary trial judge and it was not until some 18½ months later that the
    appellant was committed for trial on the count of aggravated assault but
    discharged on all other counts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground that the period following the
    appellant’s initial discharge (three months) and the time taken for the <i>certiorari</i> application and appeal to this
    court (11 months) must be deducted for the purposes of calculating the period
    of delay relevant to s. 11(b).  The Crown
    acknowledges that the remaining period of 48½ months of delay warranted <span
class=GramE>a</span> s. 11(b) inquiry and that the appellant has never waived her
    s. 11(b) rights. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF
    THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that approximately 23
    months of the 48 ½ months of non-appellate delay was “unreasonable”, “unacceptable”
    and attributable to the Crown.  He also
    found that given the appellant’s stringent bail conditions, she had suffered
    prejudice to her liberty and security of the person interests.  However, the application judge refused to
    grant a stay.  He stated, at para. 48,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>the</span> only remedy for undue
    delay is a stay of proceedings. Such a drastic remedy should be confined to the
    clearest of cases.  The court must be
    satisfied that of fair hearing can no longer be had in light of the passage of
    time.  If a fair hearing can be
    conducted, despite the passage of time, the trial should proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the balance of his reasons that he
    applied that test in determining the fact the delay had not prejudiced the fair
    trial rights of the appellant and that as this was not “the clearest of cases”,
    a stay should be refused. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant accepts and substantially adopts the application
    judge’s reasons for the delay as well as his finding that the appellant had
    suffered significant prejudice to her liberty and security of the person
    interests.  The appellant submits,
    however, that the application judge erred in law by applying the wrong test for
    a stay in the case of a breach of s. 11(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before us, Crown counsel quite properly and fairly
    conceded that the application judge had erred in law and that he had applied the
    wrong test for s. 11(b) stay. However, the Crown argues that the appeal should
    be dismissed on the ground that the application judge erred in attributing
    significant portions of the delay to the Crown.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>1) “Clearest of cases” standard and s. 11(b)<u></u></span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that the application judge erred in law by
    applying the “clearest of cases” test and in focusing his analysis on the issue
    of trial fairness.  For non-section 11(b) <i>Charter</i> breaches, a stay is the
    remedy of last resort to be reserved for the clearest of cases, the vast
    majority of which involve prejudice to the right to a fair trial or the right
    to make full answer and defence.  However,
    a different test applies in the case of a breach of s. 11(b).  There, a stay is the “minimal remedy” and it has
    been held that “[n]o flexibility exists; a stay of proceedings must be ordered”:
    see <i>Rahey v. The Queen</i>, [1987] 1
    S.C.R. 588, at p. 615; <i>R. v. Kporwodu </i>(2005),
    75 O.R. (3d) 190 (C.A.), at para. 2.  Proof
    of actual prejudice to the rights to a fair trial and to make full answer and
    defence is not invariably required.  The
    purpose of s. 11(b) is broader.  In <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, at p. 786,
    Sopinka J. held that there are three aspects to the right: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The right to security of the person is protected in
    s. 11(b) by seeking to minimize
    the anxiety, concern and stigma of exposure to criminal proceedings.  The right to liberty is protected by seeking
    to minimize exposure to the restrictions on liberty which result from pre-trial
    incarceration and restrictive bail conditions.  The right to a fair trial is protected by
    attempting to ensure that proceedings take place while evidence is available
    and fresh. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An interference with the accused’s liberty or security
    of the person interests may be sufficient to make out a s. 11(b) breach when
    considered together with the length of the delay and the explanation for why
    the delay occurred: <i>R. v. Godin</i> (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 271, at para. 38. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By applying the “clearest of cases” standard and by
    concluding that as there was no impairment of the appellant’s fair trial
    rights, there has been no s. 11(b) breach and that a stay should not be
    granted, the application judge erred in law. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>2)
    Attribution of Delay</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue is whether the application judge
    erred in attributing 23 months of delay to the Crown and to institutional delay
    for which the state must accept responsibility.  The application judge broke down the total
    period of delay into five stages:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stage 1 concerned the 18 months between the
    appellant’s arrest and her initial discharge; </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stage 2 concerned the three months between the
    appellant’s initial discharge and the decision committing her on all counts on
    the Crown’s certiorari application.</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stage 3 concerned the 13 months between the
    committal on all counts and the appellant’s successful appeal setting aside the
    committal remitting the matter to the preliminary inquiry judge. </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stage 4 concerned the 18½ months that elapsed
    between this court’s order remitting the matter to the Ontario Court of Justice
    for further consideration and the appellant’s committal on the charge of
    aggravated assault alone. </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stage 5 concerned the 12 months following the
    committal on aggravated assault only and the commencement of the appellant’s
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two periods at issue on this appeal, Stages 1
    and 4, both involving the committal proceedings in the Ontario Court of
    Justice.  The motions judge found, at
    para. 100, that the total period of 23 months delay, 12 months during Stage 1
    and 11 months during Stage 4, was “the result of institutional delay,
    unnecessary delay or unreasonable delay for which the state must accept
    responsibility.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Crown challenges the application judge’s
    findings for Stages 1 and 4. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>a) Stage 1</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Stage 1, the Crown relies on the
    decision of this court in <i>R. v. Allen</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 331, at p. 348, where Doherty J.A. stated the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When addressing s. 11(b), one must consider the
    inherent time requirements needed to get a case into the system and to complete
    that case. Those time requirements can include adjournments necessitated by the
    need to find additional court time when initial time estimates prove
    inaccurate.  The inherent time
    requirements needed to complete a case are considered to be neutral in the s.
    11(b) calculus.  The recognition and
    treatment of such inherent time requirements in the s. 11(b) jurisprudence is
    simply a reflection of the reality of the world in which the criminal justice
    system operates. No case is an island to be treated as if it were the only case
    with a legitimate demand on court resources.  The system cannot revolve around any one case,
    but must try to accommodate the needs of all cases.  When a case requires additional court
    resources the system cannot be expected to push other cases to the side and
    instantaneously provide those additional resources. [<span class=GramE>citations</span> omitted] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the situation in the case at bar is
    distinguishable as the application judge identified causes for the delay that
    take this case out of the realm of the inherent time requirements discussed in <i>Allen</i>.  The underestimation of the time required for
    the preliminary inquiry was directly attributable to the Crown’s failure to
    disclose in timely fashion the contents of the appellant’s lengthy video statement.  The amount of time over the estimate taken
    for the preliminary inquiry was almost precisely the amount of time required to
    deal with the video statement.   Had the time actually required been accurately
    estimated and scheduled at the outset, later difficulties in finding additional
    dates to complete the preliminary inquiry – which led to further delay - could
    have been avoided.  The application judge
    found that had more timely disclosure been made by the Crown, a more realistic
    estimate of the time required for the preliminary inquiry could have been set
    and several months could have been saved. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also found that when the matter
    took longer that the initial estimate, despite the preliminary trial judge’s
    direction to the trial coordinator to prioritize the case, the matter proceeded
    intermittently and with significant added delays, as other matters were added
    to the docket.  Moreover, the application
    judge found that even after delay became a serious concern, no steps were taken
    to ensure that it was completed as quickly as possible.  As a former member of the Ontario Court of
    Justice, the application judge was particularly well-placed to assess the cause
    of the delay.  We see no basis to
    interfere with his finding that the delay was unnecessary and not explainable
    as a product of the inherent time requirements needed to complete the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to the Crown’s
    submission that the trial judge erred in finding that a delay of 12 months was
    caused by a combination of late disclosure by the Crown and the Ontario Court
    of Justice’s failure to schedule the preliminary inquiry in an appropriate
    fashion, and that that period should thus be attributed to the Crown for the
    purposes of the s. 11(b) analysis.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:
normal'>b) Stage 4</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Stage 4, the Crown submits that had the
    appellant not appealed her committal on all counts on the Crown’s <i>certiorari</i> application, she would have
    been tried with her co-accused in a timely fashion and that the 11 month delay
    should not be attributed to the Crown.  In
    our view, this submission is entirely devoid of merit.  As already noted, the time taken for the
    appeal itself has already been subtracted from the period of delay relevant to
    the s. 11(b) inquiry.  The appellant had
    a legal right to appeal the order committing her on all counts and by so doing,
    she achieved a significant benefit.  As a
    result of the appeal and the remission of the matter to the preliminary inquiry
    judge for further consideration, rather than facing trial on conspiracy to
    commit murder, attempted murder, and aggravated assault, the appellant faced
    trial only on the count of aggravated assault.  We fail to see how the appellant can be said
    to have delayed her trial or to have waived or forgone an earlier trial date by
    successfully insisting upon her legal rights and achieving a significant
    benefit thereby.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error on the part of the application judge in
    his attribution to the Crown of 11 months delay at Stage 4.  As a result of the delay that had already
    occurred at Stage 1, this case was already teetering on the brink of the s.
    11(b) abyss.  Despite this, the Crown
    failed to take any steps at Stage 4 to ensure that the matter moved forward
    expeditiously.  To the contrary, the
    Crown adopted a strategy for the case that was bound to result in further
    significant delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown took the position that the order of this
    court amounted to a <i>mandamus</i> and that
    the preliminary inquiry judge had no option but to commit the appellant on all
    counts.  This, in turn, led the Crown to
    insist upon a separate date to argue that issue and to refuse to agree to dates
    for the reconsideration until after that issue had been decided.  Further delay resulted when Crown counsel was
    unavailable on the dates that had been set.  In the end, there was a delay of 18 months for
    a matter that took a total of only three days to argue and one month for the
    preliminary inquiry judge to decide.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, a substantial portion of that delay was
    directly attributable to the unreasonable position taken by the Crown.  It is difficult to see any basis for Crown
    counsel to have interpreted this court’s order remitting “the matter to the
    preliminary inquiry judge for further consideration on the whole of the
    evidence” as amounting to an order for <i>mandamus</i>.
     As we explained at para. 19 of our
    judgment, “Parliament has clearly assigned jurisdiction to the preliminary
    inquiry judge in s. 548(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to commit or discharge
    an accused.”  The only reference to <i>mandamus</i> was at para. 21, where we
    pointed out that the Crown could ask for that remedy in an appropriate case. As
    the Crown clearly had not asked for <i>mandamus</i> and as our order remitted the matter to the preliminary inquiry judge for
    further consideration on the whole of the evidence, there was no reasonable
    basis for the Crown taking the position it did.  Accordingly, the Crown must be held
    accountable for the delay that resulted. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The period of 48 ½ months of non-appellate delay was
    well in excess of the 14 to 18 month guideline for cases involving a
    preliminary hearing.  The application
    judge did not err in attributing 23 months of that delay to the Crown and to
    institutional delay for which the state must accept responsibility.  On appeal, the Crown does not seriously
    challenge the application judge’s finding that the appellant suffered
    significant prejudice to her liberty and security of the person interests.  </p>

style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the appellant was charged with a very
    serious offence involving significant bodily harm, the seriousness of the
    charge is but one factor to consider and will not <span style='line-height:200%'>by itself justify what is otherwise an unreasonable
    delay: <i>Kporwodu</i>, at para 192. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When faced with an application for a stay on grounds of
    delay, a judge must consider many factors together in a balancing
    analysis.  As McLachlin J. wrote in her
    concurring reasons in <i>Morin</i>, at p.
    810,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[t]he task of a judge in deciding whether proceedings against
    the accused should be stayed is to balance the societal interest in seeing that
    persons charged with offences are brought to trial against the accused's
    interest in prompt adjudication. In the final analysis the judge, before
    staying charges, must be satisfied that the interest of the accused and society
    in a prompt trial outweighs the interest of society in bringing the accused to
    trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The factors to be considered include the length of
    the delay, any waiver by the accused of the delay, the reasons for the delay
    and prejudice to the accused. But simply listing factors does not resolve the
    dilemma of a trial judge faced with an application for a stay on grounds of
    delay. What <span class=GramE>is</span> important is how those factors interact
    and what weight is to be accorded to each.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, a delay of 48 ½ months of
    non-appellate delay, 23 months of which were attributable to the state, caused
    substantial prejudice to the appellant’s liberty and security of the person
    interests and therefore constituted a breach of the appellant’s s.&nbsp;11(b)
    right to be tried within a reasonable time. </p>

    conviction and enter a stay. </p>
