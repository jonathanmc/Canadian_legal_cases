    background is necessary to resolve it.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2000, Dr. Olivieri started three actions against a variety of
    defendants, including Apotex (collectively “Apotex”).  The proceedings were
    consolidated into a single action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A court-ordered mediation took place on November 2 and 3, 2004.  At the
    end of the first day, Dr. Olivieri made three alternative offers to Apotex,
    each of which contained a term that the parties would enter into a
    non-disparagement agreement.  On the second day, Apotex made a counter-offer
    which Dr. Olivieri ultimately accepted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The redacted version of the counter-offer is as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Outline of Proposed Settlement Between Nancy
    Olivieri; and Apotex Inc., Jack M. Kay, and Barry Sherman</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Part A – To be made public</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         Joint settlement statement – all
    litigation dismissed –   claims and counterclaims.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         Filing of consent dismissals.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         Statement by Dr. Olivieri:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            “Dr. Olivieri acknowledges that research
    over the last    five years has revealed that Deferiprone will assist    some
    patients in the treatment of thalassemia and   wishes Apotex well in this
    important work.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.         Statements by both parties: Olivieri and  Apotex/Sherman/Kay:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            a.  Mutual expressions of regret for
    language that they  used in past years about each
    other.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            b.  Agreement by same parties not to
    disparage each      other in the future:</p>

    or deferiprone;      and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            iii.   Parties will only express
    future views about      deferiprone in scientific
    forum.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>5.         All of the above to be contained in a
    press release.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Part B – To be confidential</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         [Amount
    to be paid by Apotex to Dr. Olivieri - deleted for confidentiality
    reasons.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         Olivieri to provide Apotex with data
    listed in paragraph 160 of the statement of defence and counterclaim. 
    Apotex can use this for regulatory    purposes but no consequences to
    Olivieri.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         Full and final mutual releases of all claims/potential claims existing as at settlement date, including all   actions
    commenced by Olivieri [or] by Apotex.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Olivieri brought a motion under rule 49.09 of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, to enforce the alleged settlement agreement. 
    Apotex resisted the motion on the basis that either the parties had no meeting
    of the minds about the meaning of disparagement or, if such an agreement was
    found to exist, Dr. Olivieri had breached or repudiated it by disparaging
    Apotex after the agreement had been reached, contrary to the terms of the
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order of C. Campbell J., dated August 4, 2006, Dr. Olivieri’s motion
    was dismissed.  The motion judge found that the settlement agreement was
    conditional on further elaboration and negotiation of the words “disparage” and
    “scientific”.  Accordingly, he was of the view that there had been no meeting
    of minds and no enforceable agreement had been reached.  In light of this
    conclusion, the motion judge found it unnecessary to deal with Apotex’s
    alternative argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Olivieri appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first appeal was heard in May 2007 (the “first appeal”).  In July
    2007, this court delivered reasons for decision in the first appeal.  It
    allowed Dr. Olivieri’s appeal because it determined that the parties had
    reached a valid settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”).  It so
    concluded because it found that the parties had: (1) a mutual intention to
    create a legally binding contract; and (2) reached agreement on all of the
    essential terms of the settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the record did not permit the first appeal court to decide Apotex’s
    contention that if a concluded settlement agreement existed, Dr. Olivieri had breached
    or repudiated it by virtue of having disparaged Apotex.  At paragraph 55 of its
    reasons for decision in the first appeal, this court stated that its
    determination that a valid settlement agreement existed was made without
    prejudice to Apotex’s right to take such steps as it deemed appropriate to
    pursue its allegations that Dr. Olivieri had breached or repudiated the Settlement
    Agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The parties were unable to settle on the
    form of the order in the first appeal.  In October 2007, a draft order was
    presented to me as a single member of the panel, along with the parties’
    written submissions and a draft order.  Paras. 2 and 3 of the draft order read
    as follows:    </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         THIS COURT ORDERS that the parties
    entered into an enforceable settlement agreement on November 5, 2004. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         THIS COURT ORDERS the parties to comply
    with the terms of the settlement agreement, including the provision of a mutual
    release.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dispute between the parties in respect of the draft order was
    Apotex’s contention that a further paragraph (the “impugned paragraph”) should be
    added to reflect para. 55 of the reasons for decision in the first appeal.  Para.
    3 of the draft order was not the subject of argument in the written submissions
    or otherwise.  Nor was it the subject of discussion between counsel.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the parties’ written submissions, I handwrote a fiat
    directing the draft order to issue without the impugned paragraph.  The reason
    given for refusing to add the impugned paragraph was that it was in the nature
    of a comment, rather than an operative part of the court’s disposition. 
    However, the fiat also stated that failure to include the impugned paragraph in
    the order did not mean that it could be ignored.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An order was then filed, which included paras. 2 and 3 as set out above
    (the “2007 Appeal Order”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 30, 2008, Dr. Olivieri brought a motion for directions in
    Superior Court regarding the enforcement of the Settlement Agreement and the
    2007 Appeal Order (the “enforcement motion”).  Among other things, she asked
    for judgment according to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, including
    payment of monies by Apotex to her.  Apotex resisted the motion on the basis that
    Dr. Olivieri had repudiated the Settlement Agreement and, therefore, it had no
    obligation to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2008, Apotex commenced an action for a declaration that Dr.
    Olivieri had repudiated the Settlement Agreement or, alternatively, damages for
    breach of the Settlement Agreement and a set-off for such damages from any
    amount owing under the Settlement Agreement (the “Repudiation Action”).  The
    basis for the action is Apotex’s continuing contention that Dr. Olivieri disparaged
    Apotex and deferiprone after the Settlement Agreement had been reached, contrary
    to her obligations under the Settlement Agreement.  It appears that there are
    material facts in dispute in the Repudiation Action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated November 28, 2008, Strathy J. granted the enforcement motion
    and ordered Apotex to pay Dr. Olivieri the sum owed under the Settlement Agreement
    plus interest (the “Enforcement Order”).  He did so on the basis that Dr. Olivieri’s
    motion under rule 49.09 had been decided in the first appeal and that para. 3
    of the 2007 Appeal Order required the parties to comply with the Settlement
    Agreement.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apotex appealed the Enforcement Order.  This court heard the appeal on
    May 19, 2009 (the “second appeal”).  It allowed the second appeal, set aside
    the Enforcement Order, and substituted an order directing the parties to submit
    their questions to the panel that decided the first appeal.  The panel hearing
    the second appeal was of the view that the meaning of para. 3 of the 2007
    Appeal Order and its effect on Apotex’s repudiation claim was better addressed
    by the panel that decided the first appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By letter to counsel dated July 30, 2009, the parties were asked to make
    written submissions to the first appeal panel on: 1) what questions they wished
    addressed by the first appeal panel; 2) the appropriate procedure for dealing
    with the issues of enforcing the Settlement Agreement and alleged repudiation,
    specifying what the court should do at this time and how the matters should
    proceed, if at all, in the Superior Court; 3) whether and, if so how, the 2007
    Appeal Order should be modified; and 4) any other issues they wished raised with
    the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons respond to those submissions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apotex says that the 2007 Appeal Order and the result of the first
    appeal stand without the need for variation or elaboration.  It says that the
    result of the first appeal was to find that the Settlement Agreement existed, while
    leaving open for determination Apotex’s claim that Dr. Olivieri breached and/or
    repudiated the Settlement Agreement.  It says that those issues must be decided
    by the Superior Court and that they will be through the Repudiation Action.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apotex’s position is that para. 3 of the 2007 Appeal Order requires both
    sides to comply with the Settlement Agreement.  Apotex argues that if it must meet
    its obligation under the Settlement Agreement to pay Dr. Olivieri but Dr.
    Olivieri need not meet her obligation to refrain from disparaging Apotex, then
    only one side would be required to comply with the Settlement Agreement.  That,
    it says, would be an unfair reading of para. 3 of the 2007 Appeal Order. 
    Furthermore, in light of para. 55 of the reasons for decision in the first appeal
    and the fiat, it cannot be what the court intended.  Finally, Apotex says, such
    an interpretation would work a fundamental injustice as it would effectively
    grant judgment to Dr. Olivieri before trial, that is, before its [Apotex’s]
    repudiation claim had been adjudicated.  If any change to the 2007 Appeal Order
    is to be made, Apotex suggests a minor variation to para. 3 to indicate that
    any issues relating to compliance are to be resolved in the Repudiation Action. 
        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Olivieri’s position is that the 2007 Appeal Order must be modified
    or supplemented.  She says that because the 2007 Appeal Order does not specify
    the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Agreement cannot be
    “carried into operation” and she cannot enforce it.  Dr. Olivieri argues that
    Apotex must comply with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement now and
    separately pursue any claim it may have for repudiation and/or breach.  She maintains
    that if Apotex’s repudiation/breach allegations are later found by a court to
    have merit, there are legal remedies available to Apotex which it can
    pursue.      </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept Apotex’s submission.  As I will explain, Apotex’s position is
    consonant with the law and what has transpired in these proceedings.  Dr. Olivieri’s
    position is consistent with neither.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that the genesis of these proceedings was Dr.
    Olivieri’s first motion, which was brought pursuant to rule 49.09 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  <i>Capital Gains Income Streams Corp. v. Merrill Lynch
    Canada Inc. </i>(2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 464 (Div. Ct.) is highly instructive on the
    operation of rule 49.09, so I begin there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of <i>Capital Gains</i> are similar to those of the present
    case.  In <i>Capital Gains</i>, the parties attempted to settle litigation
    between them by means of a negotiation.  Following the negotiation, the
    plaintiffs moved pursuant to rule 49.09 of the <i>Rules of</i> <i>Civil
    Procedure</i> for an order that a settlement had been reached.  The motion was
    dismissed because the motion judge was unable to determine if a settlement had
    been reached.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs brought a motion for leave to appeal.  That motion was heard
    by Carnwath J., sitting as a single member of the Divisional Court.    He
    denied the motion, explaining that when rule 49.09 is properly understood,
    there were no conflicting decisions on its application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paras. 9 and 10, Carnwath J. explains the two-step analysis required by
    rule 49.09:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[9]       The first step is to consider whether an
    agreement to settle was reached.  In doing so, the proper approach is to treat
    the motion like a Rule 20 motion for summary judgment.  If there are material
    issues of fact or genuine issues of credibility in dispute regarding whether
    (i) the parties intended to create a legally-binding relation or (ii) there was
    an agreement on all essential terms, a court must refuse to grant judgment.  [Citations
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[10]     The second step, once an agreement has been
    found to exist, is to consider whether, on all the evidence, the agreement
    should be enforced.  In this second step, a Rule 20 approach is not applied,
    but rather a broader approach, taking into account evidence not relevant to a
    Rule 20 inquiry.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In para. 11 of his reasons, Carnwath J. quoted <i>Milios v. Zagas </i>(1998),
    38 O.R. (3d) 218 (C.A.) at p. 223, which explained that in determining whether
    to enforce a settlement under rule 49.09, the motion judge must consider all of
    the relevant factors disclosed by the evidence.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let us consider what has happened in the present case in light of that
    analysis.  As has been noted, Dr. Olivieri brought her first motion pursuant to
    rule 49.09.  The motion judge found that no settlement agreement had been
    reached and so ordered.  That order was set aside on the first appeal when this
    court determined that an enforceable settlement agreement existed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to recognize that the first appeal dealt only with the
    first step under rule 49.09, namely, whether a settlement agreement existed.  This
    court, in the first appeal, undertook no consideration of whether to enforce the
    Settlement Agreement.  Indeed, the court was not asked to specify the precise
    terms of the Settlement Agreement, nor did it.  These comments are not intended
    to suggest that the two steps in a rule 49.09 motion must be undertaken at
    different times or in separate proceedings.  Rather, they are to clarify what took
    place in the first appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the first appeal had been decided and the Settlement Agreement had
    been found to exist, it was open to Dr. Olivieri to take the second step under
    rule 49.09, namely, to return to the Superior Court and request that the court
    enforce the Settlement Agreement.  In fact, Dr. Olivieri did return to the
    Superior Court seeking enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.  However, as
    has been noted, enforcement of the Settlement Agreement was ordered based on
    para. 3 of the 2007 Appeal Order.  This was an error for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the 2007 Appeal Order could not provide the basis for the
    Enforcement Order.  The first appeal disposed of a single issue:  did the
    parties reach an enforceable settlement agreement?  The question of whether, if
    such an agreement were found to exist it should be enforced, played no part in
    the first appeal.  Enforcement was not considered or dealt with in any way in
    the first appeal.  Consequently, the 2007 Appeal Order could not be the basis
    for an order enforcing the Settlement Agreement.  As the parties made no
    submissions in respect of the inclusion of para. 3 in the 2007 Appeal Order, I
    cannot be sure what either party intended it to mean.  What should be clear
    from the foregoing, however, is that the court did not intend – and, indeed,
    could not have intended – para. 3 to be an order enforcing the Settlement
    Agreement.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, interpreting para. 3 of the 2007 Appeal Order so as to permit
    Dr. Olivieri to enforce the Settlement Agreement without regard to Apotex’s
    claim that she breached or repudiated the Settlement Agreement is to fail to give
    effect to para. 55 of the reasons in the first appeal and to ignore the law
    regarding repudiation.  As para. 55 of the reasons makes clear, although the
    Settlement Agreement had been found to exist, that determination was made
    without prejudice to Apotex’s right to have its claim of repudiation
    adjudicated.  The intention expressed in para. 55 is echoed in the fiat issued
    in respect of the 2007 Appeal Order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the law regarding repudiation, if Apotex is correct and Dr.
    Olivieri repudiated the Settlement Agreement, as the innocent party, Apotex had
    the right to elect to treat the Settlement Agreement as at an end, with both
    parties then being discharged from further performance under the agreement: see <i>Place Concorde East Limited Partnership v. Shelter Corp. of Canada Ltd. </i>(2006),
    270 D.L.R. (4th) 181 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 49-50.  Enforcement in these
    circumstances would create a real risk of injustice and ought not to be
    ordered:  see <i>Fox Estate v. Stelmaszyk </i>(2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 846 (C.A.)
    at para. 11.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, as has been explained, when deciding whether to exercise its
    discretion and enforce the Settlement Agreement, the court was required to take
    a broad approach and consider all of the evidence.  The issues of Apotex’s
    refusal to pay and Dr. Olivieri’s alleged repudiation of the Settlement
    Agreement are inextricably intertwined.  Apotex has maintained throughout these
    proceedings that Dr. Olivieri repudiated the Settlement Agreement by
    disparaging it and that Apotex accepted the repudiation, thereby relieving it
    of its obligation to pay.  Thus, in considering enforcement, the court was
    required to take into account Apotex’s contention that Dr. Olivieri had
    breached or repudiated the Settlement Agreement.  The failure to consider
    manifestly important factors, including Apotex’s repudiation claim and the
    prejudice it would suffer if enforcement were ordered, is an error: see <i>Milios
    v. Zagas </i>at p. 224.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it is clear that the issues surrounding enforcement cannot be decided
    on a motion, I would accede to Apotex’s request that the 2007 Appeal Order be
    varied to provide that all enforcement and compliance issues be resolved in the
    Repudiation Action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would vary the 2007 Appeal Order only to the extent that
    para. 3 is amended to add that “any issues relating to compliance and enforcement
    of the Settlement Agreement are to be determined in the Repudiation Action”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of these submissions are to be dealt with in the Repudiation
    Action.     </p>
