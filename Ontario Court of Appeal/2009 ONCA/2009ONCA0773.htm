style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree with the disposition and analysis of
    Speyer J. in the Superior Court.  Nothing
    in this record provides any basis for a legitimate reasonable apprehension of
    bias claim or a legitimate claim of procedural unfairness.  The trial judge’s frustration with the
    seemingly endless course of what should have been a straightforward “summary”
    criminal <span class=GramE>proceeding,</span> is entirely understandable and,
    in our view, must be a legitimate concern to anyone concerned about the proper
    administration of justice in this province.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s frustration with the inability
    of counsel for the Crown and defence to co-operate so that court time would not
    be wasted by listening to a partially inaudible recording is again an entirely
    understandable sentiment.  In our view, the
    trial judge’s admonition to both <span class=GramE>counsel</span> could not
    possibly be viewed by any reasonable person as reflective of bias against the
    accused or any form of procedural unfairness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s comments about the progress of
    other impaired driving cases (not made in the course of these proceedings) were
    in large measure totally irrelevant and could not support the claims advanced
    in these proceedings.  We would note,
    however, that her concern about the difficulties posed by trials that stretch
    over months and months was an entirely justified concern.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also do not accept counsel’s interpretation
    of the events following the request for an adjournment to explore the
    possibility of a guilty plea.  The trial
    judge’s request for an explanation after the matter was not resolved by way of
    a plea as she had been told in all likelihood it would <span class=GramE>be,</span> was not inappropriate.  It is wrong to
    suggest that the trial judge was “disappointed” that the matter would not
    proceed by way of a guilty plea.  She was
    concerned that counsel, who had already been granted two adjournments and unsuccessfully
    sought a third on various grounds, including the anticipated guilty plea,
    should give her some indication of what had happened after the request for the
    further adjournment was made.  In fact,
    counsel did not even appear, but sent someone who was in no position to assist
    the trial judge but could only request a further adjournment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On our reading of the transcripts, the trial
    judge was concerned that the request for an adjournment to explore the
    possibility of a guilty plea had been yet a further attempt to delay these
    proceedings.  In our view, it was in that
    light that she sought some explanation for what had happened.  None was ever offered.  The trial judge acknowledged she was not
    entitled to make inquiries that would intrude on the client/solicitor
    privilege.  We do not think that the
    privilege would have been compromised by a properly framed explanation, if one
    existed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This matter is remitted to the Ontario Court for
    trial.  The appellant’s meritless
    application for <i>certiorari </i>and prohibition
    and his equally meritless appeal from the order of Speyer J. have caused a
    further delay in these proceedings.  This
    matter should proceed to completion as expeditiously as the court’s schedule
    can accommodate it.  </p>
