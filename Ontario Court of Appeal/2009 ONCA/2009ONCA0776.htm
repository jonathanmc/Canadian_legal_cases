  <h4>FACTS </h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Orr began employment with the Magna group of
    companies in 1987.  Beginning in 1993, he worked for MII in various positions
    until he resigned to become the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of MEC on
    January 1, 2001.  His five-year employment contract with MEC commenced on
    January 1, 2001 and was to expire on December 31, 2005.  It contained three
    provisions relevant to this appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, it provided that MEC could elect to
    terminate Orr’s employment either by providing him with written notice or by
    paying him a retiring allowance.  If Orr was terminated within the first three
    years of his five-year contract, he would be entitled to two years notice, or a
    retiring allowance equivalent to his salary, and annual bonus for the preceding
    two years.  If he was terminated in the final two years of his contract, the
    notice period would only be one year and the retiring allowance would be based
    on the one year preceding termination. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, s. 10 of the employment contract
    provided that MEC, in its sole discretion, was entitled to assign the
    employment agreement to “an affiliated or other organization at any time”.  If
    the agreement was assigned, its conditions were to continue in “full force and
    affect [sic]”.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the agreement expressly contemplated that
    it would “continue to apply to your employment in a similar or other capacity
    with the Corporation [MEC] or any member of the Magna Group”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> On March 25, 2003, Jim McAlpine, the Chief
    Executive Officer (“CEO”) of MEC, told Orr that he was being replaced as CFO,
    and that his employment would be terminated.  At this point, Orr had not yet
    been employed with MEC for three years, and thus was eligible for the two-year
    retirement allowance in his contract.  However, Orr did not seek to exercise
    his contractual right to claim the two year retirement allowance at this time
    because he learned from McAlpine that there might be an equivalent position for
    him within the Magna group of companies. Furthermore, McAlpine offered Orr employment
    back at MII in the interim. Orr met with Stronach, who directly or indirectly
    controls MII and MEC, Belinda Stronach, Vince Galifi, the CFO of MII, and Roman
    Doroniuk, Chief Operating Officer for MEC, to discuss possible job
    opportunities in the Magna family.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 26, 2003, Orr agreed to the assignment
    of his contract to MII. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Between March 25, when Orr was told he would be
    replaced as CFO, and June 26, 2003, when Orr’s contract was assigned to MII,
    two positions within the Magna group of companies were offered to Orr.  He
    turned both of them down on the basis that they were not comparable to his position
    as CFO with MEC. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 23, 2003, just three days prior to
    agreeing to an assignment of his contract, Orr met with Doroniuk.  He told
    Doroniuk that he was frustrated that no permanent position had been found for
    him, and that he was concerned that if he stayed until January 2004, MEC would terminate
    him and try to pay him only one year of severance.  Doroniuk counselled Orr to
    stay and told Orr that he had spoken with Stronach, Galifi, and Brian Colburn,
    who was senior counsel at MII, and that all had said that there was no
    intention to string Orr along until January 1, 2004 and then pay him only one
    year’s severance. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Orr met with Stronach later that same day and
    told him he thought it was time to exercise the termination provisions of his
    contract.  Stronach asked Orr to stay and work on a Magna project known as Project
    Tempo.  Orr told Stronach that he was not happy being a project man and wanted
    a commitment that he would receive a job comparable to his previous CFO
    position with MEC.  Stronach said he could not make a commitment at that time,
    but told Orr he should not worry because something would materialize. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to Orr, he told Stronach that he
    needed a new contract and Stronach said to draft it up “as we had talked.” 
    However, Orr testified that Doroniuk had earlier told him that he had six
    months to negotiate before his current two-year termination provision in his
    contract expired, and suggested it would be better to wait awhile before
    pressing for specific contractual terms.  As a result, Orr did not draft up a
    new contract.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Orr testified that on June 24, 2003, Gary Cohn,
    a lawyer employed by MEC, advised him that “there was some risk that if I
    transferred to Magna International that there may be some decision that - that
    I had accepted that as my new role and may not be able to in fact claim my two
    year termination under my contract” and that he should “write a soft letter to
    Magna, carefully worded letter to Magna, to protect myself”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As we have indicated, Orr’s employment contract
    with MEC was assigned to MII on June 26, 2003. Both Orr and Doroniuk signed the
    letter of assignment.  The letter stated that MII had agreed to assume Orr’s employment
    contract with MEC, dated October 5, 2000, effective June 26, 2003.  The
    assignment letter also stipulated that MII’s assumption of Orr’s contract would
    not affect his MEC stock option entitlement.  Although a draft of the
    assignment letter contained a reference to the provision in Orr’s contract with
    MEC which permitted MEC to assign the contract, this reference was deleted at
    Orr’s request. It appears Orr did not agree that MEC had the right to
    unilaterally assign his contract because he wanted to preserve his right to
    claim he had been constructively dismissed in the event he was assigned to a
    position that was not comparable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Orr continued at MEC until July 28, 2003, when
    the new CFO began employment.  On that day Orr met with Stronach.  Orr handed
    Stronach a letter he drafted on July 17, 2003, the relevant portion of which
    read as follows:    </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am delighted that in our recent conversations
    that we agreed to an arrangement that I would work on the potential sale of
    Magna Steyr’s “Powertrain” business unit to Tesma.  I agree to transfer my
    rights to Magna on the understanding that I will work on this project for
    several months with an anticipated completion date prior to October 31, 2003. 
    If during that period, a future position in Magna does not develop, I shall be
    treated as having been terminated under the existing provisions of my employment
    contract and entitled to the payments in the contract.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>Orr’s handwritten notation at the bottom of
    the letter reads: “Met with Frank on 28 July 03, his first day back from

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s decision may be summarized as
    follows.  Orr’s employment was terminated by MEC on July 28, 2003, when the new
    CFO took over.  At that time he was entitled to the two-year severance
    provision of his contract. Orr’s position, that his contract was not assigned
    pursuant to the provision in s. 10 of that agreement which unilaterally
    permitting MEC to assign his contract to an affiliated organization, was
    supported by the deletion of the reference to s. 10 from the assignment letter.
    In addition, any assignment of the contract pursuant to s. 10 would have to be
    to an equivalent position and Orr’s interim position at MII was not equivalent to
    that of CFO of MEC. When Orr’s contract was assigned to MII, MEC’s obligation
    to pay Orr this retirement allowance was not extinguished, and Orr did not give
    up any rights triggered by his termination.  MII assumed the obligation to pay
    Orr a two-year retirement allowance, but had the opportunity to rectify MEC’s breach
    of the employment contract, and thus avoid paying the retirement allowance, by
    finding Orr a comparable position within MII.  </span></p>

    she held that Orr’s contract was both terminated and assigned at the same time.
     We would hold that this was an error of law.  In March 2003, when Orr was told
    he was being terminated from MEC, Orr had the choice to take his retirement
    allowance or to work for MII.  He chose employment with MII. Even though the
    assignment of Orr’s contract with MEC to MII was not carried out pursuant to s.
    10, allowing MEC to assign his contract unilaterally, the fact remains that
    Orr’s contract was assigned, not terminated.  When Orr agreed to the assumption
    of his contract by MII on June 26, 2003, his contract continued even though his
    employment with MEC was over and his position with MII was “interim”.  The
    interim nature of the position with MII did not affect the validity of the
    assignment of Orr’s contract or the continuation of his employment. Orr does
    not submit that he was constructively dismissed when he was transferred to MII.
    The reality of business life is that from time to </span><span lang=EN-US

    employee to the employ of the parent company, or another affiliated company
    within the group, as the interests of the whole may require. <span

    two-year retirement allowance was not triggered.    </span></p>

    Orr was prepared to agree to an assignment of his contract to a position at MII

    dismissal. In exchange, Orr alleges an agreement suspending or extending his
    right to choose a two-year severance payment if no permanent suitable

    Stronach on July 28, 2003 and in his evidence that Stronach agreed with the
    letter.  The trial judge recognized this at para. 122 of her reasons. She
    stated: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although there is evidence which I believe that on

    agreed the plaintiff’s two year retiring allowance entitlement would continue

    proof. Having found that Orr was terminated in June 2003, she held that Orr’s
    entitlement to seek enforcement of the two-year severance provision did not
    depend on any forbearance agreement. It was incumbent on Magna to show that Orr
    had, as stated in para. 124 of her reasons, “lost the two-year commitment
    regarding salary and bonus”.  The trial judge’s error in reversing the burden
    of proof flows from her erroneous conclusion that Orr’s contract was terminated
    in June, 2003. As a result, despite her very thorough reasons, we must set
    aside the trial judge’s holding that Orr was entitled to a lump sum amount upon
    termination equivalent to two years salary. </span></p>

    implicitly agreed to give them time to do so.  In the interim, Orr agreed to
    work on special projects, with no change in his compensation or bonus, and to
    the assignment of his contract to MII. As Orr was not told until June, 2004
    that there would be no comparable position for him, the trial judge held that it

    where there were any inconsistencies, as between Stronach’s evidence and Orr’s,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The difficulty with Orr’s position is that the
    letter of July 17 refers to an October 31, 2003 date and does not, as Orr now

    himself testified that, prior to signing the assignment letter in June, 2003,
    Doroniuk told him he had six months to negotiate before his current two-year
    termination provision expired. Doroniuk also gave testimony to that effect and
    the trial judge accepted his evidence. Thus, even assuming that a forbearance

    be dismissed in January 2004 and given one year working notice. He did not make
    such a claim until launching his lawsuit.  Orr’s position that he was entitled
    to two years severance after December 31, 2003, and until Magna told him it
    could not find him a comparable permanent position, appears to be a bald
    statement. </span></p>

    a forbearance agreement was reached, there is little on this record to suggest
    that Orr had an indefinite right to claim two years severance as long as he was
    not put into a comparable position by Magna. When Orr’s contract was assigned
    time continued to run under it. Orr knew this. Orr was terminated after the
    first three years of the contract and was entitled to only one- year’s
    severance. Much was made of Stronach’s comment on examination for discovery
    that it would be a waste of taxpayer’s money to pay Orr two year’s severance. 
    The trial judge rejected Stronach’s explanation at trial that the comment was
    made in hindsight. In our opinion, Stronach’s comment is not so much an indication
    of bad faith but an elaboration of Magna’s position that it did not have a
    legal obligation to pay Orr two year’s severance.  Having regard to these
    considerations, we would not order a new trial.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, as an alternative to the wrongful
    dismissal claim, Orr alleged three untrue misstatements attributable to
    Stronach at para. 46 of his amended statement of claim.  The first was that
    Magna wished to retain Orr indefinitely.  The second was that if a suitable
    alternative position was not found, Orr would continue to be entitled to
    “enforce the termination rights in the Agreement and receive a payment of an
    amount equivalent to two years’ salary and Annual Bonus.” The third allegation
    was that Stronach told Orr the January 9, 2004 notice of termination was of no
    effect. Orr argued that he had consented to the assignment and assumption of
    his contract by MII as a result of the first two negligent misrepresentations
    made to him by MEC and MII.  Orr also sought to hold Stronach personally liable
    for making negligent misrepresentations on which Orr relied when accepting the
    assignment of his contract to MII.  </span></p>

    Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, this court should make the decision the trial
    judge should have made or that a new trial is required.  </span></p>

    no reasonable possibility of success. Thus, a new trial should not be ordered. </span></p>

    indirectly in any misrepresentation to the plaintiff” and that as judgment had
    been given against MII and MEC on what she described as the “primary” claim Orr
    did not push for judgment against Stronach.  Having said this, at para. 223 of her
    reasons the trial judge explicitly dismissed the claim against Stronach. </span></p>

    dealing with the costs of the trial, the trial judge refused to accede to
    Magna’s submission that costs awarded to Orr should be reduced because she had
    dismissed the claim against Stronach personally. In doing so, the trial judge commented,
    “I dare say that the plaintiff had a reasonably good chance of success had it

    pay Orr two years’ severance indefinitely.  Inasmuch as we have held that Magna
    did not agree to pay Orr two years’ severance indefinitely, the cross-appeal
    could in theory reemerge. However, section 134(6) of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act, </i>requires that, before ordering a new trial, a court must be satisfied

    be a statement of fact, one of the elements required for the tort of
    misrepresentation, but, in any event, the statement is entirely bound up with
    and dependent on the second.  The second is that Orr would continue to be
    entitled to “enforce the termination rights in the Agreement and receive a
    payment of an amount equivalent to two years’ salary and Annual Bonus.” Based
    on our earlier conclusion, these alleged representations resulted in a
    forbearance agreement that ended no later than December 31, 2003. Orr knew that
    the two-year termination provision under his Employment Agreement expired on
    December 31, 2003 and that there was a risk he would only receive twelve
    months’ notice.  While he certainly wanted an indefinite two-year provision, he
    was never told that he would be entitled to a two-year lump sum payment if a
    CFO position was not found after 2003.   </span></p>
