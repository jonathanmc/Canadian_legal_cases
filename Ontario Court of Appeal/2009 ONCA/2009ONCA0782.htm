  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the order under appeal, the motion judge varied the order governing custody
    and access of the child, Sabrina Shayana Jaya Persaud, born February 25, 2006,
    so that the child’s primary residence was with her father, rather than her
    mother.  The reasons given for this significant change to the original order are
    sparse, but appear to be twofold.  The first reason is that the motion judge viewed
    the mother as having baseless concerns about her personal safety <i>vis a vis</i> the father.  The second was the mother’s wish to have no communication with the
    father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the motion judge was without jurisdiction to make the
    order in question.  As this court has made clear, jurisdiction to vary a
    custody and access order is dependent on an explicit finding of a material
    change in circumstances since the previous order was made.  If an applicant
    fails to meet this threshold requirement, the inquiry can go no further: see <i>Litman
    v. Sherman </i>(2008), 52 R.F.L. (6th) 239 (Ont. C.A.).  The matter is
    jurisdictional and a court must make a finding of a material change in
    circumstances even when, as here, both parties request a variation.  In the
    present case, no such finding was made.  Thus, as has been stated, the motion
    judge was without jurisdiction to vary the original order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A material change in circumstances is one which: (1) amounts to a change
    in the condition, means, needs or circumstances of the child and/or the ability
    of the parents to meet the needs of the child; (2) materially affects the child;
    and, (3) was either not foreseen or could not have been reasonably contemplated
    by the judge making the original order: see <i>Gordon v. Goertz</i>, [1996] 2
    S.C.R. 27, at para. 13.  None of these factors are addressed in the brief
    reasons of the motion judge nor can they be found on a broader reading of the
    record as a whole, including the exchanges that the motion judge had with counsel. 
    Indeed, it is highly questionable whether the third factor could have been made
    out, given the motion judge’s numerous statements to the effect that the issues
    and differences between the parties were but a rehash of that which he heard at
    the time he made the initial custody and access order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, on this record, it is not clear how these factors could have been
    determined, given the significant conflict in the affidavit evidence of the
    parties.  In such circumstances, a variation motion cannot be properly
    determined on affidavit material.  As this court has stated, resolution of
    conflicting evidence on critical matters requires a trial of the issues, in
    which <i>viva voce</i> evidence is called.  See this court’s decision in <i>Schnarr
    v. Schnarr</i> (2006), 22 R.F.L. (6th) 52.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, we note also the extremely limited and insufficient
    consideration given to the matter of the child’s best interests when deciding
    if, and how, access should be varied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally and in any event, the motion judge appears to have fundamentally
    misunderstood the mother’s evidence.  She did not allege physical violence on
    the part of the father, nor did she assert a concern for her personal safety. 
    Her allegations are based on the father’s allegedly controlling behaviours, including
    deluging her with emails to the point of harassment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>DISPOSITION </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we allow the appeal, set aside the orders below, including
    the order as to costs, and dismiss the motion to vary.  The result is that the custody
    and access order dated December 7, 2007 is restored.  However, given the young
    age of this child and as she has now lived with her father for the past year,
    we are of the view that it is not in her best interest to abruptly change - once
    again - her living arrangements.  Thus, we order that the December 2007 custody
    and access order be restored following a six-week transition period.  Beginning
    this Friday, November 6, 2009, at noon, the child shall reside with the mother
    for one week.  That is to be followed by the child residing with her father for
    the following week.  This arrangement with alternating primary residences shall
    continue for six weeks at which point the December 2007 order shall come into
    effect, including whatever provisions are made therein for access over the holiday
    period.  The terms of this order in respect of the six-week transition period
    may be varied by agreement of the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This order is made without prejudice to either party to bring a fresh
    motion to vary, which we direct would be heard by a judge other than the motion
    judge in this case.  As the December 2007 order requires that further
    proceedings to be brought before the motion judge, we order that the December
    2007 order be varied by the deletion of para. 31.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There shall be no costs of the motion below.  Costs of the appeal are
    ordered in favour of the appellant, fixed in the amount of $7316.71, all
    inclusive.</p>
