  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from a December 2008 disposition, made
    pursuant to s. 672.54(c) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, in which the Ontario Review Board ordered the continued detention of
    the appellant, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Breitwieser</span>, who suffers from
    schizoaffective disorder.  In ordering
    the appellant’s detention to continue in a minimum secure facility, the Board
    also continued another term from its preceding annual review. That term gave
    discretion to the person in charge of the hospital to allow the appellant to
    live in the community, rather than be confined to the hospital.  On appeal, <i>amicus curiae</i> for Dr. Breitwieser argues that the Board erred in
    its review by failing to give adequate consideration to discharging the
    appellant with the condition that he continue to adhere to his medication
    regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ensuing events have largely overtaken the appeal.  Those events are set out in the affidavit of
    Dr. Ellis, a psychiatrist who treated the appellant at the hospital.  In our view, the affidavit is admissible as
    “fresh” evidence on this appeal.  Dr.
    Ellis’s affidavit discloses that Dr. Breitwieser, pursuant to the hospital’s
    discretion, had been living on his own in an apartment since the summer of
    2008.  However, at some point after the
    December 2008 disposition, the appellant stopped taking his medication.  He began exhibiting behaviour symptomatic of
    his illness.  Given the severity of his
    condition, Dr. Breitwieser was returned to the hospital on July 29, 2009 and
    placed in its medium secure forensic treatment unit.  His return to hospital was accomplished under
    the auspices of a warrant of committal issued under s. 672.57 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and pursuant to the
    December 2008 disposition<i>.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following his return, the Review Board held a hearing
    under s. 672.81(2.1) in which it reviewed and approved the hospital’s decision
    to restrict the appellant’s liberty.  At
    the hearing, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Breitwieser’s</span> counsel supported the
    hospital’s position.  Dr. Ellis explains
    in his affidavit that Dr. Breitwieser remains in the hospital and continues to
    be mentally unstable.  Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Breitwieser’s</span> next annual review is scheduled for December
    2, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given these circumstances, <i>amicus</i> properly abandons the claim for the appellant’s
    discharge.  Instead, he seeks a new
    hearing, which would be subsumed in next month’s annual review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No more than a brief description of the appellant’s
    history is necessary for the disposition of this appeal.  The appellant had been detained since January
    29, 2004, when he was found not criminally responsible on charges of threatening
    bodily harm and breaching a probation order.  Between 2004 and 2008, with treatment, he improved.  At the December 2008 annual review, Dr. Ellis
    noted that there did not appear to be any “compliance issues” because the appellant had been taking his prescribed medication for the
    preceding two-and-a-half years.  Pursuant to a term in the preceding disposition order, beginning in the summer of 2008, the
    hospital had allowed the appellant to live in an apartment in the community, provided
    that he maintained contact with an outreach program.  The hospital acknowledged that the appellant
    was successfully obtaining and administering his own medication, although it
    expressed concerns about the appellant’s lack of insight into his need for
    medication and his reclusive lifestyle.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the appellant’s excellent progress, <i>amicus</i> argues that the December 2008
    Review Board ought to have considered a conditional discharge under s.
    672.54(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> because such a disposition was the “least onerous and least restrictive” to the
    appellant as required by the terms of s. 672.54.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the December 2008 review, Dr. Ellis explained that
    he had a concern about a conditional discharge on the basis that the appellant
    posed a risk for medication non-compliance.  In his view, in such an event, a need might arise for early intervention
    “before anything untoward would happen.”  In this regard, Dr. Ellis was concerned that the appellant would not
    agree to return to the hospital if need be and that “he would become ill if the
    Mental Health Act had to apply.”  The
    inability to return Dr. Breitwieser expeditiously to the hospital, in his view,
    precluded a conditional discharge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Board’s reasons refer to evidence that Dr.
    Breitwieser would not consent to returning to the hospital in the event of his <span
class=SpellE>decompensation</span>, they do not discuss two important
    elements.  First, the Board’s reasons do
    not address whether Dr. Breitwieser would have consented to a condition
    requiring him to continue his medication regime.  Section 672.55 provides that a disposition
    under s. 672.54 may include a condition regarding treatment “where the accused
    has consented to the condition and the court or Review Board considers the
    condition to be reasonable and necessary in the interests of the accused.”  In our view, the Board could not give
    adequate consideration to the disposition of a conditional discharge without
    knowing the appellant’s position on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Board’s reasons do not address the most
    appropriate route to accomplish an involuntary return to hospital in the event
    of the appellant’s <span class=SpellE>decompensation</span>.  There are different routes available under
    different sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and under the <i>Mental Health Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7, as amended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the Board’s disposition provides for detention, as
    was imposed in this case, the appellant could be returned to the hospital
    through a warrant of committal issued by the Review Board pursuant to s. 672.57
    of the <i>Criminal Code </i>in Form 49.  That warrant directs peace officers to convey
    the appellant to the hospital, where he would be subject to the conditions
    imposed in his last disposition order.  In such a case, the appellant could be returned to hospital at the
    request of staff without the need to detain him in jail or to obtain a court
    order.  In this way, the appellant could
    be properly placed, not a jail, but in an appropriate secure setting, which
    would make it possible to resume his treatment expeditiously and avoid any
    further <span class=SpellE>decompensation</span> that could result from a prolonged
    delay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the Board had ordered a conditional discharge instead,
    and the appellant had breached a condition, a warrant under s. 672.57 would not
    have been available because Parliament has provided that such warrants are only
    available for dispositions of detention under s. 672.54(c) and not for
    conditional discharges granted under s. 672.54(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, s. 672.91 would apply.  It provides for the arrest of “an accused
    without a warrant … if the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe the accused
    has contravened or wilfully failed to comply with the assessment order or
    disposition or any condition of it, or is about to do so.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After making an arrest under s. 672.91, unless the
    peace officer decides to release the accused pursuant to s. 672.92(1)<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></a></span>,
    the accused must be brought before a justice of the peace pursuant to s. 672.93.  The justice of the peace may order the
    accused’s return “to a place specified in the disposition or assessment order”
    if “the justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe the
    accused has contravened or failed to comply with a disposition or an assessment
    order.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, an accused under a conditional
    discharge, <span class=GramE>who</span> <span class=SpellE>decompensates</span> and whose conduct raises public interest concerns, will not be returned immediately
    to the hospital.  Instead, given
    reasonable grounds for a breach of condition, he will be arrested.  The accused will then be brought before a
    justice of the peace who, upon being satisfied there are reasonable grounds, may
    order the accused’s return to the hospital if that return is specified as a
    term of the discharge disposition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If an accused is apprehended pursuant to these
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    there may be a delay between apprehension and a return to hospital.  During that delay, an accused will be
    detained in the inappropriate setting of a jail with a concomitant delay in
    receiving medication or other treatment and a potential further deterioration
    in his or her condition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An accused can also be brought to hospital through the
    provisions of the <i>Mental Health Act</i>,
    if there is reasonable cause to believe that the accused is suffering from a
    mental disorder that is likely to cause serious bodily harm to the accused or
    another person, or is likely to prevent the accused from looking after him or
    herself.  Section 16 allows a justice of
    the peace to order that such a person be brought into custody to be examined by
    a physician based on sworn information that the person has behaved in a threatening,
    violent or incompetent manner, or that the person has benefited in the past
    from treatment to which the person is incapable of consenting.  Section 17 permits a police officer to take the
    person directly into custody to be examined, but only if the person has acted
    in a disorderly manner, and it would be “dangerous to proceed under section
    16.”  Depending on the conditions in a
    conditional discharge disposition, these provisions may establish a higher
    threshold than the provisions of s. 672.91 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, although the Board referred to Dr.
    Ellis’s evidence indicating detention was necessary to ensure timely
    intervention if the appellant <span class=SpellE>decompensated</span>, Dr.
    Ellis’s opinion was premised on the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i> and did not address the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and <i>Mental Health Act</i> options to apprehend the appellant if he became medication non-compliant while
    conditionally discharged.  The Board also
    did not address whether the appellant would consent to appropriate conditions
    of discharge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, in any case where the primary issue is
    compliance with conditions, and there is an air of reality to the claim that a
    conditional discharge would be an appropriate disposition, the Board must
    address these two elements.  First, the
    Board must canvass whether the accused will consent to appropriate conditions
    under s. 672.55.  Second, it must address
    the potential mechanisms for the accused’s return to the hospital in the event
    of non-compliance, and determine whether the patient is likely to agree to
    return or whether a combination of s. 672.55 and either s. 672.92 or s.
    672.93(2) or another route of return would be sufficient in the circumstances.  The Board must consider these elements in
    light of the legislative scheme and the requirement of s. 672.54 that, after taking
    into consideration the designated factors, the Board must make the disposition
    “that is the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused”.  This consideration is in keeping with the
    direction of the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Winko</span></i> [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625 at para. 43 that the
    “offender is to be treated with dignity and accorded the maximum liberty
    compatible with Part XX.1’s goals of public protection and fairness to the NCR
    accused.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the Board did not do so in this case.  As a result, we would have allowed the appeal
    and remitted the matter for the Review Board for a rehearing to consider a
    conditional discharge pursuant to s. 672.78(3).  However, in light of the fresh evidence of the appellant’s ongoing <span
class=SpellE>decompensation</span>, his current status in medium <span
class=GramE>security,</span> and the pending annual review on December 2, 2009,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
