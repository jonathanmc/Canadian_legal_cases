  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of two counts of assault
    and sentenced to a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment consecutive to
    the penitentiary sentence he was already serving.  He appeals against conviction and applies for
    leave to appeal sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Conviction Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant raises numerous issues on his conviction
    appeal. However, his grounds fall into two main categories: first, grounds
    relating to the trial judge’s credibility assessment; and second, grounds
    relating to the fairness of the trial. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept the appellant’s submissions that the
    trial judge erred in her credibility assessment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the complainant’s evidence
    that the appellant assaulted her by biting her on two occasions was supported
    by the evidence of the investigating officer. The officer testified that he
    observed a clear bite mark on the complainant's wrist that was larger than the
    bite mark of a child and a reddish mark on the top of the complainant's
    shoulder.  He also observed bite marks on
    a table and a telephone at the complainant's residence. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Taking account of the police officer’s evidence, as
    well as the complainant's demeanour, the detail in her evidence and her lack of
    apparent animus towards the appellant, the trial judge found the complainant’s
    evidence credible. Further, after considering the appellant’s evidence in the
    context of the totality of the evidence at the trial, the trial judge rejected
    the appellant’s evidence and found that it did not raise a reasonable
    doubt.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see no error in the trial judge’s approach to the
    evidence or in her application of the burden of proof. The police officer’s
    observations of bite marks provided significant support for the complainant’s
    version of the events. Viewed in this context, it was open to the trial judge
    to find, as she did, that the appellant’s bare assertion that he had cracked
    teeth and could not have committed the offence did not raise a reasonable
    doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to the trial fairness issues, we reject the appellant’s
    complaint that the Crown’s cross-examination was abusive. The appellant became
    angry while being cross-examined about a letter the Crown suggested he wrote.
    However, the cross-examination persisted in large part because the appellant
    did not respond clearly when asked whether he had written the letter. Moreover,
    the cross-examination about the letter was not irrelevant. It was relevant to
    the appellant’s claim that this was the first offence to which he had pleaded
    not guilty; it was also relevant because the letter may have constituted an
    admission. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial counsel argued that the trial judge should
    have drawn an inference against the Crown because of its failure to call
    certain potential witnesses.  None of
    these people had actually witnessed the alleged assaults.  The trial judge rejected that
    submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, counsel argues that the trial judge
    erroneously inferred that the potential Crown witnesses were not called because
    they feared the appellant.  Counsel
    submits there was no evidence to support that inference.  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept this submission. It is not clear to us
    that the trial judge in fact drew the challenged inference.  The impugned passage from the reasons may be
    no more than a reference to the appellant's acknowledgement in his own evidence
    that there were people who were afraid of him and wanted him to remain in
    jail.  &nbsp;However, even if the trial
    judge made this error, it was not material to her ultimate determination.
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Sentence Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to the sentence appeal, the trial judge relied
    on the complainant’s injuries, the fact that the assaults were committed in a
    domestic context and the appellant's lengthy criminal record to impose a
    sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. Having <span class=GramE>regard</span> to
    these factors the sentence was not unfit; nor has the appellant identified any
    error in principle. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentence appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>
