    assaulting the two young daughters of his long-term partner.  Tiffany R., one of the complainants,
    testified that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted several times a week
    between 1999 and 2006.  She was about
    seven when the assaults began.  Tiffany
    testified that she was forced to perform and was subjected to oral sex.  She claimed that she said nothing because the
    appellant threatened her, her mother and her dog.  The second complainant, Tatyana R., Tiffanys
    younger sister, testified that she was assaulted over several weeks between
    June and August of 2006.  She indicated
    that the appellant touched her breasts, vagina and posterior sometimes over her
    clothing and sometimes under it.  Tatyana
    was eleven when these events occurred. The assault eventually stopped when the
    appellant, the complainants and their mother moved to Nova Scotia.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The mother of the complainants also
    testified.  She described her
    relationship with the appellant, the appellants relationship with her
    daughters and the disclosures that were eventually made by her daughters.  The appellant testified and denied in detail
    the allegations made against him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As is common in these cases, credibility was the
    key issue.  There were many factual
    issues raised in the course of the evidence that posed difficult credibility problems
    for the trial judge.  She delivered
    lengthy reasons that display a full appreciation of the details of the evidence
    and the arguments pertaining to the credibility of the key witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial
    judge improperly pooled her credibility assessment of the two complainants
    and the appellant in finding each complainant credible and the appellant
    incredible.  Counsel submits that as
    there was no finding that the evidence of one complainant was admissible on the
    counts involving the other, the trial judges assessment of the reliability of
    one complainants evidence could not be used to buttress the credibility of the
    other.  He further submits that in
    assessing the credibility of the appellant, the trial judge had to examine the
    appellants evidence as it related to each complainant separately.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The reasons for judgment belie counsels
    submission that the trial judge considered the evidence of the complainants
    together.  The trial judge made an exhaustive
    and independent review and assessment of the credibility of the two
    complainants.  She found each credible
    based on that independent assessment.  The trial judges brief descriptive comparison of the demeanour of the
    two complainants in the witness stand does not suggest any improper use of the
    evidence of one to bolster the credibility of the evidence of the other. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants submission that the trial judge
    did not properly consider the appellants evidence as it related to the
    allegations of each complainant separately arises out of the trial judges
    approach to the first of the three stages of the reasonable doubt inquiry described
    in <i>R. v. W.D.</i>  At that stage, the trial judge had to decide
    whether she believed the appellants evidence.  To the extent that she believed any part of his evidence which negated
    any essential element of the offence, the appellant was entitled to an
    acquittal on that charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At this first stage of the <i>W.D.</i> analysis, the trial judge examined the totality of the appellants
    evidence without distinguishing the parts of his evidence which related to the
    allegations of one complainant from those parts that related to the allegations
    of the other.  The trial judge enumerated
    several reasons for ultimately disbelieving virtually the entirety of the
    appellants evidence.  Some of those
    reasons related to allegations from one complainant or the other and some
    related to allegations from both.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We are satisfied that in considering the
    credibility of the appellants evidence at this first stage of the <i>W.D.</i> inquiry, the trial judge was
    entitled to take into account the totality of the appellants evidence.  As Charron J. recently observed in <i>R. v. Rojas</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 111 at
    para. 25, a trier of facts assessment of the overall credibility of a witness
    evidence is bound to be influenced by the totality of the evidence heard by the
    trier of fact.  We do not think that the
    trial judge was obliged  in law, nor
    could the trial judge realistically make two discrete, distinct and independent
    assessments of the appellants credibility,  one having regard to the evidence as it related to one complainant and a
    second having regard to the evidence as it related to the other complainant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately, at the first stage of the <i>W.D.</i> inquiry, the trial judge must
    decide the credibility of an accuseds evidence as it relates to the individual
    charges.  In doing so, however, the trial
    judge is entitled to examine the entirety of the appellants evidence in
    arriving at his or her credibility assessments.  We see no error in the trial judges approach to the appellants evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second submission advanced by counsel is
    based on the oft repeated claim that the trial judge applied a different level
    of scrutiny to the appellants evidence than to the evidence of the
    complainants.  Our review of the trial
    judges reasons does not support that contention.  She carefully scrutinized the evidence of the
    appellant and the complainants.  She
    articulated several reasons for her ultimate findings both in regard to the
    evidence of the appellant and the evidence of the complainants.  The trial judge acknowledged that some of the
    reasons for her findings were more significant than others.  Indeed, some of the factors referred to by
    the trial judge might be regarded as minor or even insignificant.  That was ultimately, however, her decision to
    make and it is not for this court to review the evidence <i>de novo</i> and decide what it thinks is important or unimportant.  We cannot say that her methodology was wrong or
    that the result it yielded was unreasonable.  The appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>

    range identified by this court in <i>R. v.
    D.D.</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471.  The comprehensive reasons for sentence provide a full and compelling
    explanation for the sentence imposed by the trial judge.  We see no error in principle and do not
    regard it as manifestly unreasonable.  The appeal from sentence is also dismissed.</p>
