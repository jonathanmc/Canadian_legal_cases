    C.L. and his younger brother, J.L.  The
    appellant testified and denied the allegations.  A jury convicted the appellant of assaulting both complainants.  The appellant appeals from the
    convictions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The principal ground of appeal arises out of the
    trial judges refusal to declare a mistrial after a Crown witness made certain
    potentially prejudicial comments. The resolution of that ground of appeal does
    not require a recitation of the evidence.  It is sufficient to say that the case came down to the complainants
    version of several events and the appellants denial and explanation for those
    events.  There were certainly reasons to
    question the reliability of the complainants evidence, however, it was open to
    the jury to accept that evidence and reject the appellants denial.  </p>
  <h2>The Mistrial Application</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A man named Michael Waters testified for the
    Crown.  He was a friend of the appellant
    and operated an overnight camp for teenagers.  The appellant first met C.L. at this camp.  The appellant was a volunteer there and C.L.,
    who was not happy at home, attended at the camp.  Eventually, the appellant and C.L. became
    very friendly.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During his evidence, Mr. Waters explained that
    the appellant had befriended his son, but that their friendship had waned when
    the appellant became friends with C.L.  Mr. Waters explained that this angered his son.  At this point of Mr. Waters examination-in-chief,
    defence counsel asked that the witness be cautioned against repeating what had
    been said to him by others.  Crown counsel
    asked Mr. Waters to be careful not to repeat what had been said to him by other
    people, such as his son.  The Crown said
    to Mr. Waters we dont want to hear that as part of your evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The examination-in-chief continued and within a
    very few answers, Mr. Waters gave evidence that he was told that his son had
    called the appellant a rapist pedophile and that the appellant had then threatened
    to sue Mr. Waters for defamation.  Mr.
    Waters further testified that he had been told that other boys who were friends
    of his son had called the appellant a pedophile because he was chatting on
    the Internet with young teenage boys.  This
    evidence had no relevance to the charges and was clearly potentially
    prejudicial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After Mr. Waters second use of the word
    pedophile, the trial judge interrupted and suggested that the witness would
    have to be cautioned again about impermissible hearsay.  The Crown appeared to acknowledge the concern
    and continued his questioning.  A few questions
    later, Mr. Waters repeated his evidence that the appellant was angry with Mr.
    Waters because, according to the appellant, Mr. Waters son had called him a rapist
    pedophile.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant objected after this
    third reference to the word pedophile and the jury was excused.  The trial judge instructed the Crown to be
    careful that no further references were made to the potentially prejudicial terms.  Mr. Waters examination-in-chief continued
    for a few more moments and was completed at the end of the day.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant did not request that
    the trial judge instruct the jury concerning the potentially prejudicial
    comments that had come out from Mr. Waters.  Instead, he told the trial judge that he was considering bringing a
    mistrial application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Waters was briefly cross-examined the next
    morning, a Thursday, and two additional Crown witnesses testified.  The Crown closed its case and the matter was
    adjourned to allow counsel an opportunity to prepare his mistrial
    application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The mistrial application was brought the next morning
    (Friday).  The trial judge declined to
    declare a mistrial holding:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It would appear that generally a mistrial should
    only be declared in clear cases, and when the matter is so prejudicial that a
    jury would be unable to disregard it even though a direction is given.  There is no doubt the words are prejudicial
    that were used. I do not, however, believe that they are so prejudicial that
    there is a real danger of a miscarriage of justice in that Mr. Chiasson will
    not get a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The significance of the evidence of Mr. Waters is
    small when the totality of the evidence is considered.  The jury, in my view, will decide this case
    based upon the complainants and parents evidence, and whatever evidence the
    defence might lead.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is clear as I watched the jury when the words
    were said that there was no reaction to them.  There has not been one shred of evidence left with this jury regarding
    any other problems the accused has had with the law that could ever lead them
    to conclude he had been considered a pedophile.  In fact, the evidence is that he was so angry upon hearing what Joshua
    called him that he threatened a lawsuit for defamation.  And the impression I think has been left with
    the jury that that anger and threat of the accused stopped the name-calling by
    Joshua.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Again, one would therefore be left with the
    impression Joshua knew those words to be untrue, and basically said them as
    sour grapes.  I took the words in that
    context, and I expect the jury would as well.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge then provided counsel with a copy
    of what he proposed to say about the potentially prejudicial evidence.  The trial judge proposed to give that
    instruction to the jury immediately.  Neither counsel had any objection to the instruction, the timing of the
    instruction or suggested that the judge should say anything more to the jury.  The trial judges admonition to the jury delivered
    on Friday morning included the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> You will further recall Mr. Waters saying that
    because of his sons anger he called Mr. Chiasson a rapist pedophile, and at
    that point, I stopped the evidence and advised that it was not proper because
    it was hearsay, and you returned to jury room.  I hope you remember that scenario.  At the beginning of this trial, I told you a number of times, and very
    clearly, that you could only make your decision based on properly admitted
    evidence.  As you no doubt have concluded
    what Mr. Waters said his son said is hearsay evidence, and should not have been
    said.  Mr. Waters or any other witness
    cannot tell you what someone else has said; only the person who said the words
    can give that evidence so that you can see them, you can hear them tell their
    story, and watch and hear them be cross-examined, so that you can determine
    what, if anything, you wish to believe out of their evidence.  Joshua Waters is not being called as a
    witness, because I assume the lawyers have decided, he adds absolutely nothing
    to the case and cannot assist you in making your decision.  There is absolutely no evidence that we have
    heard to indicate Mr. Chiasson having any way any type of history that would
    justify Joshua calling him a pedophile.  You have heard numerous names bandied about in this trial from child
    molester to puppet, and now pedophile; none of that is evidence that you
    should in any way consider.  You should
    decide this case on the evidence that establishes the facts of conduct and
    actions, and not on name-calling, innuendo, conjecture or rumour. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial concluded on the following Monday.  The trial judge made no reference to any part
    of Mr. Waters evidence in his charge to the jury.  The jury did have a question about Mr. Waters
    evidence, however, that question related to the parts of Mr. Waters evidence
    that were clearly relevant to the charges and not to the part of his evidence
    where he made the potentially prejudicial comments.  The trial judges answer to the jurys
    question was approved by counsel for the appellant and the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was asked by defence counsel to
    repeat the mid-trial warning he had given to the jury as part of his closing
    instructions.  The trial judge had
    indicated earlier that he would do so.  He ultimately determined that he would not include the further caution
    in his closing instructions and said nothing about the potentially prejudicial
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A mistrial is appropriate where that remedy is
    necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice:  <i>R. v. Burke</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    857 at para. 75.  Other less extreme
    remedies, such as an appropriate mid-trial instruction, should be considered
    and rejected as inadequate before a mistrial is granted:  <i>R. v.
    Toutissani</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4364.  The determination of whether a mistrial should be granted is ultimately
    a matter in the discretion of the trial judge.  As with other discretionary decisions, this court will not interfere
    with the decision of the trial judge except where the court concludes it is
    clearly wrong or based on some erroneous principle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This was a close case.  The potential prejudice to the appellant from
    the three references to rapist pedophile and pedophile is obvious.  Certainly, it was arguable that the prejudice
    could not be cured by a corrective instruction.  However, we are satisfied that it was open to the trial judge in the
    exercise of his discretion to conclude that a mid-trial instruction could
    remove the potential prejudice.  The
    mid-trial instruction given here was, in our view, up to that task.  That instruction properly characterized the
    comments not as anyones opinion, but rather as comments made in anger by Mr.
    Waters young son.  The trial judge told
    the jury that the comments had no evidentiary value.  He told the jury that their decision could
    not depend on name-calling, innuendo, conjecture or rumour.  In our view, this instruction clearly
    identified the potential prejudice and emphatically told the jury why those
    comments could play no role in their deliberations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant, in her able
    submissions, stressed that the jury heard the potentially prejudicial evidence
    on Wednesday afternoon and were not instructed to ignore that evidence until
    sometime on Friday morning.  While it is
    true parts of two days had passed, the trial had in fact progressed very little
    during that time.  Apart from the
    completion of Mr. Waters examination-in-chief and the brief cross-examination,
    the jury heard only the evidence of two additional Crown witnesses.  That evidence was not in dispute.  The rest of the time was occupied with the
    mistrial application. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence counsel did not request a mid-trial
    instruction at any earlier point in time.  Instead, he told the trial judge that he was considering bringing a
    mistrial application, which he in fact brought the Friday morning.  While other judges might have proceeded
    somewhat differently, we do not think that this trial judge can be faulted for
    waiting to see if counsel would bring a mistrial application and for hearing
    that application before deciding what, if anything, should be said to the
    jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant also argued that the
    trial judges failure to repeat the caution in his closing instruction was
    fatal.  Once again, the trial judge could
    have repeated the instruction.  That is a
    decision that was very much for him to make.  We cannot conclude that the failure to repeat the instruction was
    fatal.  The mid-trial instruction as
    given was appropriate and, in our view, would still have force some few days
    later when the jury retired to consider this matter. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trial judges are faced with a very difficult
    task when asked to declare a mistrial.  This trial judge had the advantage of having seen this jury operate over
    a period of time.  He had gained a sense
    or a feel for the dynamics of this trial.  He had an appreciation for the potential effect of the impugned evidence
    on this jury that cannot be conveyed to this court through the written word of
    the transcript.  The trial judge took
    into account the feel he had for this jurys reaction to the potentially
    prejudicial comments.  We think he was
    entitled to do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We are not satisfied that the trial judges
    exercise of his discretion was clearly wrong.  Nor has the appellant demonstrated that the discretion was exercised on
    the basis of any erroneous principle.  This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second argument advanced by the appellant
    concerns the adequacy of the instruction as to the position of the
    defence.  There are different ways to
    present the position of the defence and the Crown.  There is always something that was not said
    that could have been said in support or against one or other of the positions.  This trial judge approached the evidence by
    relating the positions of the parties as it applied to the specific counts in
    the indictment and by reviewing some of the evidence as it applied to each
    count. In our view, that was an appropriate approach and fully set forth the
    position of the defence as it related to the various incidents underlying each
    of the charges.    </p>
