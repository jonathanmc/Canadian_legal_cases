    governments must exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis and comply with a
    duty of procedural fairness when enforcing undertakings given by citizens or
    permanent residents of Canada to sponsor a relative’s immigration to Canada. </span></p>

    sponsored a relative’s entry into Canada under the family class immigration
    regime established by the <i>Immigration and
    Refugee Protection Act</i>, S.C. 2001,
    c. 27 (the new Act) and by the former<i> Immigration Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (the old Act). </span></p>

    appellants all signed undertakings in which they promised to provide for their
    sponsored relative’s essential needs and to ensure that their relative would
    not require social assistance during the sponsorship period.  Seven of the appellants signed undertakings
    under the old Act; the eighth appellant, Mr. Hince, signed an undertaking under
    the new Act.</span></p>

    Act provide that the amount of any social assistance paid to a sponsored
    relative during the sponsorship period is a debt owed by the sponsor to the
    government and that the debt “may be recovered” either by the federal
    government or by the provincial government that made the payments.    </span></p>

    not dispute that, under the terms of their undertakings, they owe a debt to Ontario
    for the amount of social assistance paid.  However, the appellants claim that circumstances beyond their control left
    them unable to </span>honour<span
lang=EN-US> their undertakings. On this basis, each of the appellants applied
    for a declaration that they are discharged from their sponsorship obligations. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    their applications in the Superior Court, in addition to raising various
    contractual defences, the appellants argued that, properly interpreted, the
    language of the Acts stating that sponsorship debt “may be recovered” indicates
    that the governments have discretion to forgive sponsorship debt.  In support of their argument, the appellants
    relied on the terms of their undertakings, which state that the government may
    choose not to recover in circumstances involving “abuse” or in “other
    appropriate circumstances”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    that the governments exercised their discretion unreasonably and violated their
    duty of procedural fairness by taking steps to enforce the appellants’
    undertakings without first giving them a fair opportunity to be heard and
    without taking into account their individual circumstances. </span></p>

    appellants’ applications.  In addition to
    rejecting their contractual </span>defences<span
lang=EN-US>, she found that the words “may be recovered” are merely enabling in
    the sense that they do no more than permit the government to enforce the debt.
    She concluded that they do not impose either an obligation on government to
    consider the appellants’ circumstances on a case-by-case basis, or a duty of procedural
    fairness. </span></p>

    that they are no longer seeking a declaration that they are discharged from
    their individual sponsorship obligations.  However, they claim that the application judge erred in rejecting their
    arguments concerning discretion and procedural fairness and in failing to make
    declarations in that regard. </span></p>

    Ontario for recovery of sponsorship debt from defaulting sponsors and also provide

    foreign nationals permanent residence, and a path to Canadian citizenship,
    under three broad classes described in federal immigration legislation.  First, the refugee class, based on Canada’s
    humanitarian tradition, provides resettlement in Canada for displaced and
    persecuted persons.  Second, the economic
    class includes persons who have the confirmed ability to become established in
    Canada and to contribute to its economic growth.  Third, the family class includes persons who
    have a close family relationship with a citizen or permanent resident of Canada,
    who, in turn, has the economic resources to sponsor their foreign
    relative.  </span></p>

    and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad” as a means of
    promoting the domestic and international interests of Canada.  Section 3(1)(d) of the new Act refers to the

    for social assistance, Canada wrote to the sponsors and warned them of their
    default under their undertakings.  Ontario
    sent similar letters advising defaulting sponsors that they were responsible
    for repaying any social assistance paid to their sponsored relatives and

    the appellants’ argument that the words “may be recovered” in s. 145(2) of the
    new Act, which were carried over from s. 118(2) of the old Act, signal
    Parliament’s intention to give the government a broad case-by-case discretion
    concerning whether to enforce sponsorship debt.  Instead, she found that these words merely
    enable the government to enforce the debt at both the federal and provincial
    levels.  She said:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, the use of the word “may” in s. 145(2)
    of the <i>IRPA</i> permits the government to
    enforce a debt at both the Provincial and Federal levels.  This does not, however, envisage a discretion
    being exercised on a case-by-case basis as submitted by the applicants.  To suggest that the use of the word “may”
    imports a duty on the respondents to provide the applicants with an opportunity
    to make submissions on their individual circumstances prior to the government’s
    decision to enforce the debt against them is not, in my view, a reasonable
    interpretation of the legislation.  </p>

    application judge considered <i>Cha v.
    Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [2007] 1 F.C.R. 409, in
    which the Federal Court of Appeal observed that, while generally permissive,
    “may” must still be interpreted in context, taking account of not only its
    ordinary meaning, but also the scheme and purpose of an act and the intention
    of the legislature. </span></p>

    particular, the new Act eliminates the notice requirements that existed in the
    old Act concerning the assignment of sponsorship debt and makes sponsorship
    debt recoverable at any time by either level of government.  Significantly, neither the legislation nor
    the sponsorship undertakings stipulate any procedural requirements for debt
    recovery. </span></p>

    to be a formalized process for debt enforcement.” Accordingly, she rejected the
    arguments that the words “may be recovered” require the exercise of discretion,
    or give rise to a decision that creates a duty of procedural fairness.  Rather, she characterized the role of
    government in relation to the enforcement of sponsorship debt as “purely

    countered that express language in s. 145(3) of the new Act that “[a] debt may

    debt.  Absent a restriction, presumably
    the amount repaid could be zero.  Similarly,

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, Ontario’s decisions regarding
    the appellants were anchored by its “Guiding Principle” that a “defaulting
    sponsor is required to repay the full amount of the debt.”  On its face, this policy precludes exercising
    discretion to negotiate a settlement permitting a sponsor to cure default on
    payment of an amount less than the full amount of the debt.  Such a step is expressly contemplated in both
    s. 135(b)(i) of the new Regulations and the undertakings.  We recognize that the Guiding Principles also
    refer to permitting collection to be waived in cases of “documented
    extraordinary circumstances” such as incapacity.  However, we interpret this as likely referring
    to the deferral power set out in the undertakings.  Moreover, as we have said, negotiating a
    settlement is expressly prohibited.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although declining to exercise
    this discretion may well be defensible in most circumstances, a policy that
    requires that result in every case improperly fetters or restricts the
    discretion of the decision-maker.  To
    this extent, the policy is inconsistent with the overall legislative scheme and
    amounts to an improper fettering of Ontario’s discretion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Second, apart from abuse, which is specified
    as a basis for deferral in the undertakings, the only examples in Ontario’s policy
    statements of considerations warranting a deferral of enforcement of
    sponsorship debt are considerations involving the sponsor’s financial
    circumstances.  Ontario’s list of
    specific reasons for deferral is thus restricted to matters involving a
    sponsor’s financial circumstances and abuse.  Although Ontario also gives decision-makers a residual discretion to
    defer in cases of “documented extraordinary circumstances”, the examples given
    to illustrate this ground relate exclusively to the sponsor’s ability to pay. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In contrast, the undertakings
    refer to government making a choice to defer enforcement in an unspecified
    range of circumstances.  For example, the
    Hince undertaking says the Minister and the province may choose not to enforce
    “if the default is the result of abuse or in other circumstances.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our opinion, by limiting the
    examples it has given to financial considerations or abuse, Ontario has
    effectively restricted the “other” considerations in addition to abuse that are
    open to a decision-maker when deciding whether to defer sponsorship debt to the
    financial circumstances of a sponsor.  In
    so doing, Ontario has created a policy that is inconsistent with the overall
    legislative regime and thereby improperly fettered its discretion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although it may well be that
    factors such as the importance of the sponsor’s obligations to the government
    would lead a decision-maker to decline to defer enforcement despite other
    presenting circumstances in most cases, in our view, a policy that mandates
    that result in every case is improper.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, to the extent that the
    residual ground in Ontario’s deferral policy allows only for consideration of
    “documented extraordinary circumstances”, it raises the bar higher than the
    various iterations of the undertakings that mandate consideration of “other circumstances”
    or “other appropriate circumstances”.  None of the undertakings restrict the grounds for deferral to
    “extraordinary circumstances” and none specify a mandatory requirement for
    documentation of the particular circumstance.  Again, this aspect of the policy is inconsistent with the overall
    legislative scheme and amounts to an improper fettering of Ontario’s
    discretion.</span></p>

    of discretion are illustrated by the fact that Ontario is unable to identify any
    case since the inception of its policy where it has exercised its discretion in
    favour of a sponsor.  In practice, in
    restricting its decision-making to deferral of enforcement based on financial
    circumstances, and by raising the bar to require “documented extraordinary
    [financial] circumstances”, Ontario has precluded itself from doing what is
    contemplated by the legislative scheme: to reach an agreement with a sponsor in
    satisfaction of the default or to take no recovery action against a defaulting
    sponsor in the face of “other” or “other appropriate circumstances”.</span></p>

    provisions do not allow enforcement of old undertakings under the streamlined
    enforcement provisions of the new regime.  They give three reasons.  First,
    they submit, if the government intended to make the old undertakings
    enforceable under the new regime, it would have “deemed” the undertakings to be
    undertakings under the new regime, rather than stipulating that they were to be
    “governed” by the new regime.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that
    “governed” is less specific than “deemed”, a term employed by Parliament
    elsewhere in the new Regulations.  As an
    example, the appellants point to s. 348 of the new Regulations, which deems
    judicial review applications commenced under the old Act to be commenced under
    and governed by the new Act: see also s. 337.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the appellants,
    the Governor in Council made a deliberate choice in using the word “governed”
    in s. 351 rather than the word “deemed” to avoid a requirement that every
    sponsor enter into a new undertaking. However, they argue, “governed” stops
    short of transforming an undertaking under the old Act into an undertaking
    under the new Act and of making an old undertaking enforceable under the new
    Act.</span></p>

    that express statutory language would be necessary to make old undertakings
    enforceable under the new regime because the new regime removes their right
    under s. 118(2) of the old Act to litigate the governments’ claim for
    enforcement of sponsorship debt, as other sponsors did successfully in cases
    such as <i>Manitoba v. Barkman</i>, 2007
    MBQB 54 (CanLII), affirmed (2008), 225 Man R. (2d) 166 (C.A.), leave to appeal
    denied, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 526 and <i>Manitoba

    that an interpretation that the old undertakings are not enforceable under the
    new Act is consistent with the government’s pre-2004 decision not to enforce
    sponsorship undertakings.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    ambiguity in the transition provisions. A plain reading of s. 351(1) in context
    leads to the conclusion that the Governor in Council intended undertakings
    given under the old Act to remain in effect and to be “governed” or controlled
    by and enforceable under the new Act.  Any doubt about the government’s intention is answered by s. 351(2),
    which specifically provides for recovery of sponsorship debt accumulated under
    old undertakings. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman"'>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, the government’s
    intention to impose the new regime on the old undertakings is evident from
    other provisions in the new Regulations.  For example, the government explicitly created
    an exception to the imposition of the new regime in relation to the old
    undertakings in s. 351(3), which stipulates that the duration of the old
    undertakings was not affected by the new regime.  The fact that Parliament provided a specific
    exception to the application of the new Act for undertakings entered into under
    the old regime strongly indicates that it intended, as a general matter, for
    old undertakings to function as if they were entered into under the new Act.  If old undertakings were to merely be
    continued under the new Act, s. 351(3) would be redundant.</span></p>

    nature of the defences available in such an action.  Moreover, assuming such defences are
    available, it remains open to sponsors to seek declaratory relief as the appellants
    did in this case. Further, given our conclusion that the government must

    of the sponsor shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) the

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) if

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) if
    the sponsor does not produce a document referred to in paragraph (a), or if the
    sponsor's income as calculated under paragraph (b) is less than their minimum
    necessary income, the sponsor's Canadian income for the 12-month period preceding
    the date of filing of the sponsorship application is the income earned by the
    sponsor not including</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) any provincial allowance received by the
    sponsor for a program of instruction or training,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii) any social assistance received by the

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) if
    there is a co-signer, the income of the co-signer, as calculated in accordance
    with paragraphs (a) to (c), with any modifications that the circumstances
    require, shall be included in the calculation of the sponsor's income.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>134. (2) If an officer
    receives information indicating that the sponsor is no longer able to fulfil
    the sponsorship undertaking, the Canadian income of the sponsor shall be
    calculated in accordance with paragraph (1)(c) on the basis of the 12-month
    period preceding the day the officer receives that information rather than the
    12-month period referred to in that paragraph.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>135. For the
    purpose of subparagraph 133(1)(g)(i), the default of a sponsorship undertaking</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)
    begins when</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) a government makes a payment that the
    sponsor has in the undertaking promised to repay, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii) an obligation set out in the undertaking
    is breached; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)
    ends, as the case may be, when </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) the sponsor reimburses the government
    concerned, in full or in accordance with an agreement with that government, for
    amounts paid by it, or</p>

    determination of the proceeding:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) an
    application for revocation of citizenship under the <i>Citizenship Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) a
    report prepared under subsection 44(1) of the Act; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) a
    charge alleging the commission of an offence under an Act of Parliament
    punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>136. (2) If a sponsor or
    co-signer has made an appeal under subsection 63(4) of the Act, the sponsorship
    application shall not be processed until the period for making the appeal has
    expired or there has been a final determination of the appeal.</p>

    Jatuff de Altamirano, dated March 7, 2000:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Purpose</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The undertaking makes clear the obligations of the
    Sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) to the Minister. The undertaking also sets
    out the consequences for the Sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) if they fail to
    meet the obligations they assumed in it.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Obligations of the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s
    Spouse (If Co-Signer)</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) promise the
    Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to provide for the essential needs of
    the sponsored family members and any dependants that accompany the family
    member to Canada, if they are not self-supporting.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The obligation to provide for essential needs
    continues for the length of the undertaking.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Essential needs include shelter, food, clothing and
    other goods or services necessary for day to day living. Essential needs also
    include dental care, eye care and other health care not provided by the public
    health care available to all Canadian citizens and permanent residents.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The obligation to provide for essential needs may be
    met by the Sponsor alone, the spouse alone, or by both of them together.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The money, goods or services provided by the Sponsor
    and the Sponsor’s spouse must be sufficient for the sponsored people to live in
    Canada. The family class member and their dependents in Canada should not have
    to rely on government assistance for their day to day living. This means that
    they will not need to apply for social assistance or other benefits under
    government programs that provide for the essential needs of Canadian residents
    who cannot support themselves. These programs are described in Schedule VI of
    the <i>Immigration Act Regulations</i>. This
    Schedule may change from time to time.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) assume these
    obligations so that the family class member and accompanying dependents can be
    admitted to Canada as permanent residents. These people are admitted solely on
    the basis of their relationship to the Sponsor; they do not have to be tested
    for their ability to become successfully established in Canada. The Sponsor
    (and the Sponsor’s spouse) understand that in return, they are responsible for
    preventing the family member and any accompanying dependents from becoming
    dependent on public social assistance programs.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Length of Undertaking</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The undertaking lasts 10 years. It begins on the date
    that the sponsored family class member and any accompanying dependants are
    granted permanent residence in Canada. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The time period and obligations set out in this
    undertaking will not be changed. They continue even if the circumstances of the
    Sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) change after the date the sponsored family
    class member and accompanying dependents are granted permanent residence in
    Canada. Three examples of a change in circumstances are where the Sponsor has
    less income because he or she has had to change jobs, or has chosen to leave a
    job in order to go to school, or where the Sponsor and his/her spouse divorce.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Assignment</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Minister may assign this undertaking to a
    province. The consequences of assignment are described in the next section.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Consequences of Default</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) are in
    default of this undertaking if they do not provide for the essential needs of
    the family member or any dependent, and the family class member or a dependent
    received benefits under a government program described in Schedule VI. They
    continue to be in default until the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s spouse) has
    repaid in full the amount of the benefits received or has made arrangements for
    repayment that are satisfactory to social assistance authorities in the
    Sponsor’s province or municipality of residence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All amounts paid to the family class member or any
    dependent under a government program described in Schedule VI become a debt
    owed by the Sponsor (and the Sponsor’s spouse) to the Minister. As a result:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Minister has a right of legal action in a court
    of law for the debt against the Sponsor alone, the Sponsor’s spouse (if
    Co-signer) or against both of them.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Minister may take other actions to recover the
    debt from the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s spouse (if Co-signer).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Minister may choose not to take action to
    recover money from a Sponsor or a Sponsor’s spouse (if Co-signer) who has
    defaulted in a situation of abuse or in other appropriate circumstances. The
    decision of the Minister not to act at a particular time does not cancel the
    debt, which may be recovered by the Minister when circumstances have changed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If the Minister has assigned the undertaking to a
    province, the effect is the same as if the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s spouse had
    given the undertaking to a provincial official. In this case, all amounts paid
    out to the family class member or any dependent under a government program
    described in Schedule VI become a debt owed by the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s
    spouse to the province and may be recovered from the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s
    spouse under provincial law.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There are consequences for future undertakings if a Sponsor
    or the Sponsor’s spouse default on any sponsorship undertaking. This holds true
    for both this undertaking and any past undertakings were the Sponsor and his
    spouse have not satisfactorily paid back their debts. If this is the case,
    neither the Sponsor nor the Sponsor’s spouse is allowed to sponsor or to
    co-sign the application of another family class member as a permanent resident
    to Canada.</p>

    EXCEPT QUEBEC                                                                                                                               </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I promise the Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration to provide for the essential needs of the sponsored relative and
    their dependents who accompany them to Canada, if they are not self-supporting.
    I will provide food, clothing, shelter, and other goods or services, including
    dental care, eye care, and other health needs not provided by public health
    care. The money, goods or services provided by the sponsor and co-signer must
    be sufficient for the sponsored people to live in Canada. I understand that
    these obligations may be met by the sponsor alone, the co-signer alone, or by
    both of them.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I promise that the sponsored relatives will not need
    to apply for social assistance/welfare.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I make these promises so that the family members
    listed on this undertaking can be admitted to Canada as permanent residents. I
    understand that the family members will be admitted solely on the basis of
    their relationship to the sponsor and that they do not need to have the
    financial means to become established in Canada.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I understand that this undertaking is valid for 10
    years. It begins on the date the sponsored family members become permanent
    residents of Canada. It continues for 10 years no matter what may change in my
    life. For example, if I am divorced, change jobs, become unemployed, and/or go
    back to school, I will still be responsible to the relatives I am sponsoring or
    for whom I am co-signing.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If I fail to keep my promise and do not provide for
    the essential needs of the sponsored relatives or they receive social
    assistance/welfare while I am responsible for them, I will be in default. I
    understand that a sponsor and co-signer continues to be in default until the
    sponsor or co-signer continues to be in default until the sponsor or co-signer
    has repaid in full the amount of the benefits received or repaid the debt to
    the satisfaction of the social assistance authorities.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All social assistance/welfare paid to the sponsored
    relative or any dependent becomes a debt owed by the sponsor and the co-signer
    to the Minister. As a result, the Minister has a right to take legal action in
    a court of law against the sponsor, the co-signer or against both of them. The
    Minister may take other actions to recover the debt from the sponsor or
    co-signer. The Minister may also assign the debt to a provincial government and
    that provincial government may then take legal action to collect any amount
    paid to my relatives. If the Minister has assigned the undertaking to a
    province, the effect is the same as if the sponsor and co-signer had given the
    undertaking to a provincial official.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Minister may choose not to take legal action to
    recover money from a sponsor or co-signer who has defaulted in a situation of
    abuse or in other circumstances. The decision of the Minister not to act at a
    particular time does not cancel the debt. The Minster may recover the debt when
    circumstances have changed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There are consequences for future undertakings if a
    sponsor or co-signer default on any sponsorship undertaking. This holds true
    for both this Undertaking any past Undertakings where the sponsor or co-signer
    have not satisfactorily paid back their debts. If this is the case, neither the
    sponsor nor the co-signer is allowed to sponsor or co-sign another application
    to sponsor a family class relative.</p>

    goods and services, including dental care, eye care, and other health needs not
    provided by public health care. I understand that the money, goods or services
    provided by me must be sufficient for the sponsored people to live in Canada.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I promise that the sponsored person and his or her
    family members will not need to apply for social assistance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I make these promises so that the sponsored person

    relationship to me (as sponsor) and that they do not need to have the financial
    means to become established in Canada.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I understand that the validity period of this

    sponsored person obtains a temporary resident permit following an application
    to remain in Canada as a permanent resident, and in any other case on the day

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I understand that, pursuant to section 135 of the
    Regulations to the <i>Immigration and
    Refugee Protection Act</i>, if I breach any of my sponsorship obligations I
    will be in default. I also understand that I will be in default if a government
    makes a payment that I have promised to repay in this undertaking. For example,
    if I fail to provide for the basic requirements of the sponsored person and his
    or her family members and they receive social assistance during the validity
    period of the undertaking, I will be in default. I understand that I will
    continue to be in default until the amount of benefits received are repaid in
    full or repaid to the satisfaction of the government concerned.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I understand that all social assistance paid to the
    sponsored person or his or her family members becomes a debt owed by me to Her
    Majesty in right of Canada and Her Majesty in right of the province concerned.
    As a result, the Minister and the province concerned have a right to take
    enforcement action against me (as sponsor or co-signer) alone, or against both
    of us.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Minister and the province concerned may choose
    not to take enforcement action to recover money from me if the default is the
    result of abuse or in other circumstances. The decision not to act at a
    particular time does not cancel the debt. The minister and the province
    concerned may recover the debt when circumstances have changed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I understand that I will not be allowed to sign or
    co-sign an additional application to sponsor another person under the <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</i> and its Regulations if I am in default of any sponsorship undertaking. This
    holds true for both this undertaking and any past undertakings where I have not
    satisfactorily paid back my debts.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    El-Murr and her husband sponsored her parents’ and two brothers’ immigration to
    Canada in 1995. As Ms. El-Murr was unemployed at the time, the application was
    based on her husband’s income. Soon after her family members arrived in Canada,
    Ms. El-Murr left her home, allegedly because of spousal violence. She received
    spousal support from 1997 to 2000 and remarried in 2001. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>In
    March 2000, Ms. El-Murr’s parents applied for social assistance.  Although the governments claims that Ms.
    El-Murr was notified of her obligation to repay social assistance payments
    received by her parents in 2003, Ms. El-Murr claims she was not notified of any
    default until 2006.<a href="#_ftn40"

    corresponded with Ontario concerning her sponsorship debt and, on counsel’s
    advice, she declined to provide the financial statement Ontario had previously
    requested.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Although
    she currently works, Ms. El-Murr claims that her income is modest and that she
    is jointly responsible for the support of two children.  The essence of her position appears to be
    that she is not now and never was in a financial position to repay the debt and
    that she received inadequate notice of her default. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ontario
    forwarded her file to federal tax authorities for enforcement after she failed
    to provide a sworn financial statement. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>ii)        Pritpal Singh Mavi</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Mavi sponsored his father’s immigration to Canada in 1996.  Because of difficulties in their
    relationship, his father moved back and forth between Canada and India on a
    couple of occasions, but finally returned to Canada in the summer of 2000 when
    he began living with a relative of a cousin. Although Mr. Mavi was initially
    unaware that his father had returned to Canada, he later learned that his
    father had a job and appeared to be doing alright.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Although
    Mr. Mavi’s father began receiving social assistance in 2003, Mr. Mavi claims he
    was unaware of this.  He did not respond
    to a 2003 request to complete a sponsorship assessment form and believed that his
    father would not obtain social assistance if he did not do so. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Mavi received a letter in 2005 advising him that he was in default under his
    sponsorship agreement. After receiving this correspondence, he arranged for his
    father’s benefits to be cancelled.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Mavi subsequently wrote to Ontario asking that it refrain from enforcing his
    sponsorship debt because he had health problems and a limited ability to earn
    an income. Ontario sued Mr. Mavi in 2005, apparently after he failed to provide
    a sworn financial statement.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>iii)       Oleg Grankin</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Grankin and his wife applied to sponsor Mr. Grankin’s mother in 1999. The
    couple separated a short time later and, about a year after that, Mr. Grankin
    lost his job. Mr. Grankin applied for social assistance himself and later
    arranged for his mother to do so when she arrived in Canada in December of 2000.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Grankin claims that he was not aware of his obligation to repay social
    assistance benefits paid to his mother. In any event, he says that his income
    was less than the LICO when collection efforts began and he is not in a
    financial position to repay his sponsorship debt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Although
    he claims that he explained his circumstances to Ontario and eventually entered
    into a voluntary agreement to repay $50 per month, Ontario had already referred
    his case to federal tax authorities for enforcement.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>iv)       Cristina Jatuff de Altamirano</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    de Altamirano and her husband sponsored Ms. de Altamirano’s mother’s
    immigration from Argentina in 2000. In 2002, her mother suffered a stroke,
    which made caring for her at home extremely difficult.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    de Altamirano says a case worker encouraged her to apply for social assistance
    so her mother could be placed in a nursing home. She claims the case-worker
    told her she could “break” her sponsorship agreement and the only negative consequence
    would be that she could not sponsor another person’s immigration until she repaid
    the benefits provided to her mother.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    de Altamirano and her husband separated in 2003. In 2005, she received notice
    that she was in default under her sponsorship agreement.  Her legal representative wrote to the
    government explaining the circumstances relating to her mother’s care and
    advising of her limited income (about $25,000 per year).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>In
    November 2006 Ms. de Altamirano agreed to a voluntary repayment plan of $50.00
    per month.  Around the same time, Ontario
    advised Ms. de Altamirano that it was referring her file to the taxing
    authorities for collection.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>v)        Hamid Zebaradami</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Zebaradami applied to sponsor his fiancée’s immigration to Canada in late 1999.
    She left him in February 2001 about a week after she arrived in Canada. In
    March 2001, Mr. Zebaradami applied unsuccessfully to withdraw his sponsorship
    agreement; his fiancée began receiving social assistance that same month.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Zebaradami claims that he was unaware of his fiancée’s whereabouts after she
    left him, and that the first notice he received that his fiancée was receiving
    social assistance was in March 2006. However, he says he ran into her by chance
    in 2003. On that occasion, she was accompanied by her husband, who she said was
    a social worker, and by their two-year-old child. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Zebaradami says he was told that even if he submitted a claim to the Welfare
    Fraud Unit he would still have to repay the sponsorship debt. Although he was
    unemployed, in October 2006 he offered to repay $20.00 per month voluntarily;
    however, his request was refused.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>vi)       Homa Vossoughi</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    Vossoughi applied to sponsor her mother in 2001.  Subsequently, in 2002, Ms. Vossoughi left her
    husband, allegedly because of abuse.  When her mother arrived in Canada in March 2003, Ms. Vossoughi applied
    for social assistance for her mother because she could not support both her
    mother and her son. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    Vossoughi does not recall reading anything in her sponsorship undertaking about
    what would happen if her mother received social assistance. She claims she was
    told, when her mother applied for welfare, that the only consequence would be
    that she would be unable to sponsor another person until she repaid the social
    assistance benefits paid to her mother.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    Vossoughi did not respond to correspondence from the government in September
    2005 demanding repayment of the social assistance.  However, her lawyer wrote to the government
    seeking an exemption based on her difficult financial circumstances and her
    mother’s health problems and associated drug expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Ms
    Vossoughi declined to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement, claiming that
    a payment of even $5 per month would be too much. Ontario referred her file to
    the federal tax authorities for collection. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>vii)      Nedzad Dzihic</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Dzihic applied to sponsor his fiancée in 2002.  She arrived in Canada on February 25, 2003, but did not live with him
    and refused to marry him.  According to
    Mr. Dzihic, he had no contact with his fiancée after early March 2003.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Dzihic contacted the government in May 2003 to explain the situation.  Although he was led to believe that his
    former fiancée would be deported, unbeknownst to him she appealed her
    deportation order successfully.  Mr.
    Dzihic’s lawyer wrote to the government in September 2004 and claimed that Mr.
    Dzihic’s undertaking is not binding in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Dzihic married in 2006 and applied to sponsor his new wife.  In July 2006, the government notified Mr.
    Dzihic that his former fiancée had been collecting social assistance since May
    2006.  As a result of Mr. Dzihic’s
    default under his sponsorship agreement, his new wife’s visa to enter Canada
    was cancelled.  However, Mr. Dzihic
    appealed the cancellation successfully.<i></i></span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>viii)     Raymond Hince<i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Hince married his wife in June 2002 while she was visiting Canada.  In October 2002, he applied to sponsor his
    wife and her daughter from a previous relationship for entry into Canada.  They arrived in Canada in January 2006 but
    left Mr. Hince after less than a month.  In May 2006, his wife began receiving social assistance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>In
    May or June 2006, Mr. Hince was informed that his wife was on social assistance
    and that he would be required to repay all benefits she received.  He advised the government that he had offered

    not know where she was living.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Hince says his income was hovering around the LICO.  However, he did not complete a financial
    statement that was forwarded to him.  In

    debt or exercise its discretion not to enforce it. <i></i></span></p>

    The maximum duration of a family class undertaking was ten years:  see S.O.R./78-172, s. 6(1)(b).  In 1997, the Regulations under the old Act
    were amended to provide for an automatic duration of ten years for undertakings
    given to the federal government. The duration of undertakings administered by a
    province pursuant to a federal-provincial agreement was determined on a
    case-by-case basis: see S.O.R./97-145, s. 1(1). Ontario had no such

    S.O.R./78-172 as “payments that result from a breach of an undertaking and that
    are made directly or indirectly to an immigrant under an item described in
    column 1 of Schedule VI.”  Section 56 and
    Schedule VI stipulated the various forms of social assistance provided by
    Ontario that would constitute sponsorship debt:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'>56. For the
    purposes of subsection 118(2) of the Act, payments that result from a breach of
    an undertaking and that are made directly or indirectly to an immigrant under
    an item described in column I of Schedule VI are payments that may be recovered
    from the person or organization that gave the undertaking as a debt due to Her
    Majesty in right of Canada or in right of any province to which the undertaking
    is assigned.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'>Beginning in 1996, Schedule
    VI included the social assistance programs embodied in the <i>General Welfare Assistance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. G.6 and the <i>Family Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    F.2: see S.O.R./96-165.  In 1999, the
    list was expanded to include the programs created by the <i>Ontario Works Act, 1997, </i>S.O. 1997, c. 25, Sch. A and the <i>Ontario Disability Support Program Act,

    VI, which specified the debts that were recoverable, came into force in January
    1982: see S.O.R./81-954. Section 56 remained unchanged until July 29, 1999,
    when it was amended only to reflect a change in the section numbers under the

    and again with S.O.R./97-184. The language that we quote is taken from the 1997

    Trebilcock, <i>The Making of the Mosaic: A
    History of Canadian Immigration Policy</i> (Toronto: University of Toronto
