  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this in-writing appeal, the appellant appeals his
    convictions for robbery with a weapon and use of an imitation firearm while
    committing the offence of robbery.  He
    also seeks leave to appeal his global sentence of 18 months imprisonment and 36
    months probation.  His term of
    imprisonment was composed of the mandatory minimum one-year sentence for the
    use of the firearm (s. 85(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>) and six months<b> </b>imprisonment consecutive for the
    robbery.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 2, 2006, at approximately 1:00 a.m., the
    appellant, age 18, met five other men, all of whom were under the age of 18, in
    Toronto at a Tim Horton’s.  The six men
    drove to Guelph in a stolen car.  On
    arriving in Guelph, the men spent about two hours at the home of one of the
    young men.  They left the home and drove
    to the vicinity of the <span class=SpellE>Esso</span> Gas Bar that was
    subsequently robbed.  They parked the car
    in the parking lot of a seniors’ centre.  One of the five, perhaps the appellant remained with the car.  The other five forced their way into the
    nearby <span class=SpellE>Esso</span> Gas Bar after one had tricked the
    attendant into opening the door.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the men held a pellet gun that resembled a
    firearm to the face of the 21-year old pregnant attendant.  He told her to “let them take the money and
    don’t move.”  The other men removed cash
    and cigarettes and ran out of the gas bar in the direction of the seniors’
    centre parking lot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 4:14 a.m., the clerk alerted the police.  Two police cruisers arrived at 4:20 a.m.  One officer observed a car leave the seniors’
    centre parking lot “packed full of people”.  She contacted another officer in a nearby cruiser.  Both police vehicles pursued the car, which
    lost control and hit a fire hydrant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One man was apprehended at the scene.  The remaining five, including the appellant, fled
    on foot.  They were apprehended in a
    nearby apartment lobby at 4:23 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five men, who were all young offenders, pled guilty to
    robbery.  Charges against them regarding
    the use of the imitation firearm were withdrawn.  None of the young offenders received a
    custodial term.  The appellant, who was
    18, proceeded to trial on both charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The guilty pleas of the five young offenders formed
    part of the agreed facts at the appellant’s trial.  One of the young offenders, Mr. I., testified
    for the appellant at trial.  He stated
    that it was obvious from the car’s visibly altered ignition that it was stolen
    and, further, that the occupants talked about the fact that the car was stolen
    on their way to Guelph.  Mr. I. also
    testified about the stop at the house in Guelph and the drive to the senior’s
    parking lot en route to the gas bar.  In
    addition, he testified the appellant remained with the car while the others
    went to the gas bar.  On his evidence, the
    five young offenders only decided to commit the robbery on the way to the gas
    bar.  He also denied any knowledge of a plan
    to use a firearm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that the men drove straight to
    the Guelph gas bar from Tim Horton’s in Toronto, that he remained in the car
    while the others went to the gas bar, and that he knew nothing of a plan to rob
    the gas bar, much less one that included the use of a firearm.  The appellant said that he fled the scene
    with the others because he was “scared so I just ended up running.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge relied on parts of Mr. I’s evidence in
    rejecting the appellant’s version of the events and determined that the only
    reasonable conclusion on the evidence was that the appellant was a party to the
    robbery. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that there is an inconsistency between
    the trial judge’s reasons for conviction and sentence regarding his
    participation in the robbery.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for conviction, the trial judge
    concluded that the appellant either entered the store as a participant in the
    robbery or he remained with the car as a look-out or driver.  In his reasons for sentence, after noting
    that he would not review the details of the offences, the trial judge described
    the appellant as apparently having acted as the look-out or driver.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see this change in description as no more than a
    refinement of the trial judge’s reasons for the purpose of sentencing.  Having concluded, based on the evidence that
    he accepted, that the appellant was a party to the plan to rob the gas bar
    while using an imitation firearm, the appellant’s exact role in the execution
    of that plan was irrelevant to his liability under s. 21(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for both robbery and the
    use of an imitation firearm in the commission of the robbery.  We do not think the trial judge erred in his
    application of s. 21(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>; nor did he rely on s. 21(2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also alleges that the trial judge
    misapprehended several aspects of the evidence.  We are satisfied that the trial judge did not misapprehend the evidence
    in any material manner.  For example, we
    do not agree with the appellant that the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence concerning the appellant’s knowledge of whether the car was
    stolen.  There was ample evidence to
    support the trial judge’s finding that the appellant knew that the car was
    stolen.  It may be that some of the
    matters, for example the trial judge’s reference to the appellant’s age
    compared to that of his associates, were of little significance in assessing
    the evidence.  However, considering the
    whole of the reasons, these relatively unimportant factors did not play a
    significant role in the trial judge’s overall assessment of the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge should have
    drawn an adverse inference from the Crown’s failure to call the other four
    persons who had pled guilty to the robbery.  We cannot accept this argument.  There are obvious reasons why the Crown would not necessarily want to
    call these witnesses whose guilty pleas were referred to as part of the agreed
    statement of facts.  The trial judge had
    to decide the case on the basis of the evidence that the Crown and defence
    chose to put before him.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge should have
    given himself a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span>-
    type caution with respect to the he evidence of Mr. I.  Mr. I. gave evidence exculpating the
    appellant from any involvement in the robbery.  While certain parts of his evidence were inconsistent with parts of the
    appellant’s evidence, including his evidence about the stop at the house in
    Guelph and whether the car’s occupants knew it was <span class=GramE>stolen,</span> Mr. I. is properly viewed as a witness whose evidence was “favourable to the
    defence”.  A <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span>-type caution would not
    have been appropriate.  See <i>R. v. Watkins</i> (1972), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 341
    at p. 345.  In any event, the real issue
    is whether the trial judge was alive to the problems regarding Mr.  I.’s credibility.  We are satisfied that he was. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge should not
    have discounted the fact that the appellant may have fled the scene because of
    his involvement in the possession of the stolen car or his fear of the police
    dog.  The appellant denied that he knew
    the car was stolen.  In our view, the
    trial judge was entitled to consider the appellant’s flight as part of the
    totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the robbery to
    determine whether the appellant was a party to the robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the issue of sentence, the disparity in the
    sentences is explained in large measure by the fact that the appellant was convicted
    of the additional offence of using an imitation firearm and that the other
    participants, all of whom were young offenders, were not.  The sentence is not unreasonable having
    regard to the seriousness of the offences and the mandatory minimum sentence
    required under s. 85(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) for the use of the
    imitation firearm during the robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeals of conviction and sentence are
    dismissed.  </p>
