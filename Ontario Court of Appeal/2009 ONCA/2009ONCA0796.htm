style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with four offences as a result of an incident
    on May 3, 1999. He pleaded guilty to assault, but not guilty to the other
    charges. Following a trial, he was acquitted of breaking and entering but
    convicted of sexual assault and unlawful confinement. After lengthy sentencing
    proceedings, the trial judge declared the appellant to be a dangerous offender and
    sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. &nbsp;</a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals against the convictions for sexual assault and
    unlawful confinement and also appeals against the dangerous offender
    designation.&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         The Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant on all four charges was the appellant's then common law
    partner T.D. According to T.D., she was involved in an abusive relationship
    with the appellant for three or four years and rented the apartment where the
    incident occurred as part of a plan to break up with him. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant insisted on moving with her and she agreed to
    meet him at the apartment. The couple went out drinking; on their return to the
    apartment the appellant began beating T.D. with a mop handle, continued his
    assault by punching and kicking her, and eventually forced her to undress and
    perform oral sex on him. Later, he dragged her to the bedroom, banging her head
    repeatedly on the doorway to the bedroom as he did so. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point, T.D. was able to break away. She grabbed the appellant's shirt
    and a pair of pants and fled the apartment without putting on underwear or
    shoes. Police were called to a nearby coffee shop. She told the police that her
    boyfriend had raped her and was still at her apartment. Later, she gave a video
    statement in which she said she went to her apartment alone and encountered the
    appellant unexpectedly. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several witnesses, including the appellant, testified at trial for the
    defence. Although the appellant acknowledged punching the complainant in the
    face and chest, he denied other aspects of the assault and denied any form of
    forced sexual contact or unlawful confinement. Significantly, on the
    appellant's version of events, the complainant remained clothed throughout the
    incident.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In acquitting the appellant on the breaking and entering charge, the
    trial judge referred to evidence indicating that the telephone and hydro
    accounts for the new apartment were in the appellant's name, as well as evidence
    from some defence witnesses suggesting the pair was moving as a couple. The
    trial judge also accepted the appellant's evidence that he believed he was
    moving in with the complainant. In the end, the trial judge said she had a
    doubt concerning whether the Crown had proven the elements of the breaking and
    entering charge and accordingly acquitted the appellant of that offence.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, despite the complainant's acknowledged lie to the police about
    letting the appellant into her apartment, the trial judge accepted the
    complainant's evidence concerning the sexual assault and unlawful confinement
    charges. Concerning the latter charge, the trial judge observed that the
    complainant's evidence about her apparel and hasty flight was corroborated by
    the police.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument the appellant abandoned his ground of appeal asserting
    inconsistent verdicts but pursued several other grounds of appeal against
    conviction. He submitted that: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge's reasons were conclusory;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge applied a different standard in assessing the
    defence evidence as compared to the Crown's evidence; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge failed to specifically address important defence evidence
    indicating that the complainant had recanted; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge failed to properly caution herself about the
    dangers in the complainant's evidence; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge reversed the burden of proof. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions. Although the trial judge's reasons
    for conviction are terse, read as a whole, they demonstrate that the trial
    judge was alive to the issues at trial, including the frailties of the
    complainant's evidence; that she gave the appellant the benefit of the doubt
    where he was entitled to it; and that she made no errors in applying the burden
    of proof. &nbsp;Further, we see no indication of a differing standard being
    applied to the defence evidence as compared to the Crown’s evidence. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;The evidence the trial judge referred to concerning the
    complainant's apparel and demeanour when she arrived at the coffee shop
    provided powerful support for various aspects of the complainant's version of
    the events. Moreover, the portion of this evidence indicating the complainant was
    wearing the appellant's shirt when she fled significantly undermined the
    appellant's claims concerning how the events unfolded.  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the complainant fell into the category of witness
    that would require an explicit <i>Vetrovec</i> type caution. In any event, the
    real question in a judge alone trial is whether the trial judge adequately
    addressed the problems presented by the witness’s evidence.  This trial judge
    did; she referred to the complainant’s acknowledged lie to the police and accepted
    her explanation. We are not at all certain that the defence evidence suggesting
    the complainant had recanted was inconsistent with the complainant’s trial
    evidence. Even if it was, the corroborative evidence relied on by the trial
    judge justified her acceptance of the complainant's evidence. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewing the trial judge's reasons as a whole, we see no error in her approach
    to the evidence, nor any basis to interfere with the conclusions that she reached.
    The conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        The Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Turning to the sentence appeal, the appellant takes no issue with
    the trial judge's conclusion that he meets the criteria for a dangerous
    offender designation under both s. 753(1)(a) and (b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
     Rather, he contends that the trial judge erred by improperly imposing on him a
    burden of demonstrating that there is a reasonable possibility of eventually
    controlling in the community the substantial risk that he will reoffend. We do
    not accept this submission. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, there is no real dispute that the appellant has a long
    history of abusing domestic partners and that without treatment there is a real
    risk that he will do so again. In addition to T.D.’s evidence concerning this
    and other incidents, there was evidence of the appellant's pattern of verbal
    and physical abuse towards two other domestic partners. Such abuse included
    repeated physical abuse, death threats, incidents of forced sex, and on one
    occasion, placing a gun to a partner's head.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The psychiatric evidence for both the Crown and the defence confirmed
    that the appellant is a psychopath, that he meets the criteria for antisocial
    personality disorder and that he is a significant risk for violent reoffence.
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only real point of disagreement in the expert evidence related to
    the possibility of treatment. While Dr. Woodside for the Crown testified that
    psychopaths are untreatable and that this is especially the case for
    psychopaths with anti-social personality disorder, Dr. Federoff indicated that
    that opinion is premature because it is premised on the fact that traditional
    treatment programs not specifically designed for psychopaths do not work. In Dr.
    Federoff’s view, that does not mean that some other program will not work, at
    least to some extent. In addition, he indicated there are treatments for some
    of the appellant's other problems. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Federoff recommended a multi-faceted treatment plan, including drug
    and counselling components, and concluded, premised on that plan, that there
    was a possibility of eventual control in the community. In his view, it would
    not be possible to determine whether the appellant is treatable until he is
    offered treatment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account of both the practical unenforceability of treatment
    orders and the appellant's negative history and attitude to treatment programs,
    the trial judge found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
    there is not a reasonable possibility of controlling the risk that the
    appellant presents in the community.  The trial judge referred to the
    appellant’s failure to participate in any programs during five years in
    custody, his failure to comply with court ordered treatment programs in the
    past and his apparent lack of motivation to change. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather than imposing a burden on the defence, the trial judge concluded
    it was up to the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    does not qualify for a long-term offender designation under s. 753.1(1)(c) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This conclusion was in error. This court has determined
    that there is no such burden on the Crown and in fact no onus on either party
    under s. 753.1(1)(c): see <i>R. v. F.E.D.</i> (2007), 222 C.C.C. (3d) 373.  However,
    the trial judge’s error in this respect inured to the appellant’s benefit.
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the appellant does not qualify for a long-term offender designation. The
    sentence appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>
