  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., appeals the
    order of Hoy J. which granted summary judgment in favour of the respondent,
    Universal Stainless &amp; Alloys Inc.  (“Universal”).  The appellant was held liable for payment under
    an irrevocable and transferable letter of credit issued by it for the benefit
    of Johnston Steel Services Inc.  (“Johnston
    Steel”) which the motions judge found had been validly transferred to Universal.  Johnston Steel is not a party to these
    proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals the motions judge’s determination
    that the letter of credit was properly transferred to Universal and that
    Universal had standing to bring a claim against it directly.  It also appeals the motions judge’s
    conclusion that the discrepancies in the documents presented to the appellant
    for payment under the letter of credit were not material and did not justify
    the appellant’s refusal to pay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the appellant seeks leave to appeal the motions
    judge’s costs order, dated December 9, 2008, whereby she ordered the appellant
    to pay the following amounts: (1) $175,000.00 to Universal; and (2) $117,996.21
    to Comerica Bank (“Comerica”), its co-defendant on the motion for summary
    judgment, by way of a <i>Sanderson</i> order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Comerica is a respondent on this appeal on the costs
    issue alone.  Both Comerica and Universal
    oppose the appellant’s application for leave to appeal from the motions judge’s
    costs order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal,
    grant leave to appeal from the costs order but dismiss the costs appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Universal is a corporation headquartered in
    Mississauga, Ontario.  It is incorporated
    pursuant to the laws of Ontario and is engaged in the business of importing
    manufactured goods.  At the time the
    dispute arose between the parties, the appellant operated under the name of
    Bank One, N.A.  As a result of a
    subsequent merger, the appellant now operates as JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early 2004, Johnston Steel agreed to sell a large
    quantity of steel to Menard Inc. (“Menard”).  Johnston, in turn, entered into a contract with Universal for the purchase
    of that steel.  As a requirement of the
    sale to Johnston, Universal insisted on receiving a letter of credit in its
    favour to secure payment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>A
    letter of credit involves an arrangement whereby a purchaser directs its bank
    (the “issuing bank”) to make a specified payment to a third party (the
    “beneficiary”) or a third party’s bank provided that the terms of the letter of
    credit are complied with.  In the case of
    a documentary letter of credit, an issuing bank will pay the beneficiary upon
    receipt of the documentation outlined in the letter of credit.  Letters of credit are intended to provide
    certainty in commercial transactions and to divorce the underlying commercial
    transaction from the payment.  Obtaining
    a letter of credit would thus provide certainty to Universal that once it
    delivered the appropriate documentation, it would be promptly paid.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the request of Johnston Steel, Menard arranged for the
    appellant to issue an irrevocable and transferable letter of credit in the
    amount of US $5,426,630.00 in favour of Johnston Steel.  The letter of credit stipulated that it was
    subject to the terms of the International Chamber of Commerce Uniform Customs
    and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 revision, ICC Publication No. 500)
    (the “UCP 500”).  The UCP 500 is an
    internationally accepted set of rules and standards to which letters of credit
    are commonly subject, particularly in the context of large international
    transactions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appointed Johnston Steel’s bank,
    Comerica, the transferring bank under the terms of the letter of credit.  To satisfy its agreement with Universal,
    Johnston Steel directed Comerica to transfer a portion of the letter of credit to
    Universal as the second beneficiary, in the amount of US $4,955,500.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Universal delivered the steel and delivered its invoice
    and bills of lading to Comerica.  Comerica then substituted Johnston Steel’s invoice for Universal’s,
    delivered these documents to the appellant, and requested payment.  Menard was unhappy with the quality of the
    steel and did not take possession of the shipment.  It therefore instituted proceedings seeking
    to enjoin the appellant from paying pursuant the letter of credit.  These proceedings were later voluntarily
    dismissed.  However, the appellant, on
    its own review of the documents submitted by Comerica, declined to pay, citing various
    documentary discrepancies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, Universal did not get paid.  Instead, it re-sold the steel for a lower
    price and brought an action for damages against the appellant and Comerica.  Universal subsequently brought a motion for
    summary judgment, seeking judgment against the appellant and Comerica.  At the same time, the appellant and Comerica
    each brought motions for summary judgment seeking to have Universal’s action
    against them dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed that Ontario law applied and that there
    were no issues of material fact requiring a trial, with the exception of the
    determination of damages in the event that the appellant was held liable for
    payment under the letter of credit.  The
    only genuine issues to be determined by the motions judge were questions of law
    regarding whether Universal had standing to bring an action against the
    appellant under the letter of credit, and whether any of the documentary
    discrepancies relied upon by the appellant to decline payment under the letter
    of credit were sufficient to justify its refusal to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first issue, the motions judge found that
    Universal had standing to bring a claim against the appellant on two
    alternative grounds.  First, the letter
    of credit had been validly transferred by Johnston Steel to Universal and, as a
    result, Universal had standing to bring the action against the appellant as a
    beneficiary.  With respect to the
    appellant’s argument that the transfer was invalid because they had not
    received notice, she found that, in accordance with a general practice, the
    appellant would not have expected to receive such notice and could not therefore
    rely on Comerica’s failure to provide it as a basis to refuse payment.  In the alternative, the motions judge
    accepted Universal’s argument that the document purporting to <span
class=GramE>effect</span> the transfer of the letter of credit amounted to, at
    minimum, a valid assignment of Johnston Steel’s rights under the letter of
    credit (a <i>chose in action</i>) to Universal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second issue, the appellant raised three discrepancies
    in the documentation to justify its refusal to pay.  First, the invoice from Johnston Steel
    omitted the words “merchandise described on purchase order,” which had been
    included in the letter of credit.  Second, the bills of lading did not indicate how many originals had been
    made, despite the fact that the letter of credit required that 2 of 3 originals
    be presented to the appellant.  Third,
    the agent for the carrier that signed the bill of lading failed to indicate the
    name and capacity of the party on whose behalf it was signing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge, having referred to the Supreme Court
    of Canada’s decision in <i>Bank of Nova
    Scotia v. Angelica-Whitewear Ltd. <span class=GramE>et</span>. Al.</i>, [1987]
    1 S.C.R. 59, and this court’s decision in <i>Gan
    General Insurance Co. v. National Bank of Canada</i>, [1999], O.J. No. 206, rejected
    the appellant’s arguments on all three discrepancies.  On the first discrepancy, she held that the
    omission of the words “merchandise described on purchase order” was immaterial.  On the second, the motions judge held, citing
    Art. 28 (b) of the UCP 500, that in the absence of any indication as to the
    number of original transport documents issued, the documents should have been
    accepted as constituting a full set.  On
    the third discrepancy, the motions judge found that the signature below the
    name “American Commercial Barge Line (Carrier)” made it clear that American
    Commercial Barge Line was the carrier and that C-River was acting as its agent.
     As such, none of these alleged
    discrepancies justified the appellant’s refusal to pay under the letter of
    credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge thus granted Universal’s motion for
    summary judgment as to liability against the appellant and dismissed the
    appellant’s motion for summary judgment against Universal.  Having ruled on these two motions, she granted
    Comerica’s motion for summary judgment as to liability against Universal and
    dismissed Universal’s motion for summary judgment against Comerica.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following written submissions from the parties, the motions
    judge ordered the appellant to pay costs to both Universal and Comerica.  Although a trial to determine damages was
    still pending, she held that it was not premature to fix Universal’s costs of
    the proceeding and that, if necessary, the judge fixing costs at the conclusion
    of the damages hearing could be made aware of her costs order and would have
    leeway in the award of costs at that stage to ensure the overall costs award
    was fair.  Additionally, it was
    inappropriate to make Comerica wait until the damages determination to have its
    costs on the summary judgment motions fixed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge further considered whether a <i>Sanderson</i> order, which requires an
    unsuccessful defendant to pay the successful defendant’s costs, was justified.  After reviewing this court’s decision in <i>Moore v. Wienecke</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d)
    463, the motions judge concluded that the two-step test for a <i>Sanderson </i>order had been met.  In the result, she ordered the appellant to
    pay costs to Universal in the amount of $175,000.00 and to Comerica in the amount
    of $117,996.21.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Did
    the motions judge err in finding that Universal has a cause of action against
    the appellant?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b>Did the motions judge err in finding that the
    discrepancies in the documents presented by Comerica were insufficient to
    justify the appellant’s refusal to pay under the letter of credit?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the application for leave to appeal and the
    appeal of the costs order:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         <span style='font-size:12.5pt'>Did the motions
    judge err in awarding costs to Universal before the amount of damages was
    determined at trial?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4          Did the motions judge err in making a <i>Sanderson</i> order and requiring the
    appellant to pay costs to Comerica?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><span
lang=EN-US>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u><span
lang=EN-US>Does Universal have the right to sue
    the appellant?</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge found that the letter of credit had
    been validly transferred to Universal, entitling it to bring the action that is
    the subject of the present appeal.  She
    went on to find that, assuming that the transfer was not <span class=GramE>effective,</span> Johnston Steel had assigned its right of action to Universal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant maintains that the letter of credit was
    not transferred and, as a result Universal has no direct cause of action
    against them.  In the applicant’s
    submission, for the transfer to be effective, Comerica had to give notice of
    the transfer to the appellant before the letter of credit expired.  This was not done.  As a result, the appellant asserts that there
    was no valid transfer of the letter of credit and Universal has no status to
    bring an action against the appellant for payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in response to Universal’s alternate submission,
    the appellant submits that, in order to bring the action as the assignee of a <i>chose in action</i>, the beneficiary, Johnston
    Steel, must be made a party to the action.  Because Johnston Steel was not made a party and because, in the
    appellant’s submission, limitation issues prevent Johnston Steel from being
    added at this late date, Universal is precluded from pursuing a claim based on
    an assignment of Johnston Steel’s right of action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing first with the validity of the transfer, the
    appellant submits that absent notice, there could be no valid transfer of the
    letter of credit.  In support of this
    notice requirement, the appellant relies on paragraphs (a) and (h) of Article
    48 of UCP 500 and the terms of the letter of credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article 48 of the UCP deals with transferable letters
    of credit.  Paragraphs (a) and (h) read

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(h)       The Credit can be transferred only on the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes two submissions with respect to
    these provisions.  First, they interpret paragraph
    (a) as providing that the first beneficiary, Johnston Steel was to direct any
    request for transfer of a letter of credit to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in reference to paragraph (h), the appellant
    submits that the transfer did not comply with the terms and conditions
    specified in the original letter of credit.  In the appellant’s submission, the transferability provision in the
    letter of credit provided that Comerica had to give the appellant notice of any
    transfer before expiry of the letter of credit.  Because notice was only given after the expiry, the appellant submits
    that the motions judge erred in concluding that the letter of credit had been
    validly transferred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to the appellant’s submissions.  With respect to the first, contrary to the
    interpretation put forward by the appellant, Article 48(a) does not provide
    that a request for transfer of a letter of credit was to be made to the
    appellant.  Rather, Article 48(a)
    requires that the request be made to “the bank authorized to pay” later defined
    as the “Transferring Bank.”  By
    incorporating the UCP 500 into the letter of credit and designating Comerica as
    the transferring bank, the appellant vested Comerica with the authority to
    accept and execute requests for transfers from the beneficiary, Johnston
    Steel.  The request therefore was to be
    made by Johnston Steel to Comerica and not to the appellant.  Paragraph 48(a) of the UCP 500 was therefore
    complied with.  Pursuant to Johnston
    Steel’s request, Comerica issued a “transfer of a documentary credit” to
    Universal’s bank by which it transferred $4,955,500 of the original letter of
    credit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the appellant’s submission that the
    transfer did not comply with the terms of the letter of credit and therefore
    contravened Article 48(h) of the UCP 500.  Specifically, it is argued that the transfer
    provisions required that notice of the transfer be given to the appellant
    before the expiry date of the letter of credit.  The relevant provision reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>THIS LETTER OF CREDIT
    IS TRANSFERABLE.  TRANSFER REQUEST(S), IF
    ANY, ARE RESTRICTED TO THE ADVISING BANK HEREIN DESIGNATED THE TRANSFERRING
    BANK AND ANY TRANSFER REQUEST(S) MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE ORIGINAL CREDIT,
    AND A NOTATION OF THE TRANSFER MUST BE DULY MADE ON THE REVERSE OF THE ORIGINAL
    CREDIT BY THE TRANSFERRING BANK.  NOTICE
    OF ANY TRANSFER, INCLUDING THE NAME AND COUNTRY OF THE TRANSFERREE, MUST BE
    SENT TO US BY EITHER THE TRANSFERRING BANK AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER OR THE NEGOTIATING/PRESENTING
    BANK MUST CERTIFY THAT DOCUMENTS PRESENTED ARE FROM THE TRANSERREE AND NO
    SUBSTITUTION OF DOCUMENTS FROM THE FIRST BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED.  UNTIL SUCH NOTIFICATION IS RECEIVED BY US, WE
    WILL NOT PAY AGAINST ANY DRAFT(S)/INVOICE(S) ISSUED BY A PARTY OTHER THAN THE
    NAMED BENEFICIARY OF THE CREDIT.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The transferability provision in the letter of credit
    relied on by the appellant for its submission does not, in my view, impose as a
    condition on the transfer of the letter of credit that Comerica give notice to
    the appellant before a transfer of the letter of credit becomes effective.  Rather, properly read, the provision in the
    letter of credit relied on by the appellant can be broken down as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       <span class=GramE>the</span> letter of
    credit is transferable; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       <span class=GramE>transfer</span> requests are restricted to Comerica (the transferring bank); </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I           the requests must be accompanied by
    the original credit; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)       <span class=GramE>a</span> notation of the
    transfer must be made by Comerica on the original credit; and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)       <span class=GramE>the</span> appellant
    will not pay against any draft/invoice issued by a party other than Johnston
    Steel unless, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        <span class=GramE>notice</span> of
    transfer was sent to the appellant by Comerica at the time the transfer was
    made; or </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       <span class=GramE>the</span> presenting
    bank certifies that the documents presented are from the transferee and no
    substitution of documents from Johnston Steel is required.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>In other words, the last portion of the condition, the portion
    requiring notice of the transfer, is not a prerequisite to making the transfer
    effective.  Notice (or the specified certification
    by the presenting bank) is required <i>only</i> if the appellant is being called upon to pay on presentation of a draft or
    invoice <i>other than</i> an invoice from Johnston
    Steel.  Because the arrangement between
    Comerica and Universal was that Comerica would present the Johnston Steel
    invoices to the appellant for payment, notice of the transfer was not required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The expert retained by the appellant did not address
    the issue of notice.  The experts retained
    by Comerica and Universal did.  Comerica’s expert, Donald R. Smith, described how a transfer was to be
    made in accordance with the provisions of the letter of credit.  According to Smith, in order to <span
class=GramE>effect</span> the transfer of a letter of credit, the First Beneficiary
    contacts the Transferring Bank, who transfers the letter of credit to the Second
    Beneficiary through their bank (sometimes referred to as an “Advising Bank”).  There is no requirement to involve or give
    notice to the Issuing Bank.  Accordingly,
    Johnston Steel contacted and instructed Comerica, who then transferred the letter
    of credit to Universal through its bank, the Royal Bank of Canada.  In cross-examination Mr. Smith, responding to
    questioning from counsel for Universal, stated that notice of transfer was
    required, “[o]nly to the extent as reflected in the transfer clauses of the [appellant’s]
    letter of <span class=GramE>credit, that</span> drafts would be presented in a
    name other than Johnston Steel Services.” Because the documents presented by
    Comerica were in the name of Johnston Steel, Mr. Smith was of the opinion that
    the transfer was valid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Universal’s expert, Kenneth W. Oldfield refuted the
    contention that the appellant required notice of the transfer.  This was because: “Comerica substituted the
    commercial invoice and draft of Universal and presented to [the appellant] the
    commercial invoice and draft issued by the first (named) beneficiary Johnston
    Steel as is permitted by Article 48 of the UCP.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading the condition in this way is, as noted by the motions
    judge and conceded by the parties, consistent with the practice in the industry
    where notice of transfer is rarely given to issuing banks.  This allows the first beneficiary’s bank to
    present the first beneficiary`s documents for payment without disclosing the
    identity of the second beneficiary.  The
    beneficiary of the letter of credit can thus avoid revealing the source and
    cost of the goods to the purchaser, preventing the purchaser and supplier from
    doing business directly:  John F. Dolan,
    “What is the Matter <span class=GramE>With</span> the UCP?” (1999-2000) 15
    B.F.L.R. 501 at 507 (WC).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that even if the transfer was
    effective, Universal cannot now make a claim.  Because notice of the transfer was only given
    to the appellant after the expiry of the letter of credit, it is now too late
    for Universal (through its bank RBC) to demand payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also reject this submission.  As I have explained at para. 30, the absence
    of notice does not affect the validity of the transfer in this case.  Notice to the appellant was not required
    before the documents were to be presented to it for payment.  Comerica was to be the presenting bank and
    Johnston Steel documents were to be presented.  Comerica’s presentation of documents for payment complied with its
    obligation under the letter of credit.  The
    appellant was therefore required to pay Comerica according to the terms.  Its refusal to pay was a breach of its
    obligation to Universal under the transferred letter of credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the transfer was validly <span class=GramE>effected</span>,
    Johnston Steel’s rights under the letter of credit accrued to Universal, to the
    extent provided in Comerica’s “transfer of a documentary credit.”  That document provides that USD 4,955,500.00
    of the credit was transferred to Universal.  The requirement set out in the “transfer of a documentary credit” was as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is solely an advice of transfer of Bank One, NA
    Chicago, IL, <span class=GramE>Letter</span> of Credit number LCCHMEN00000962
    and conveys no engagement or obligation on our part.  Due to the substitution of documents by the
    first beneficiary, the second beneficiary’s must send the required shipping
    documents to Comerica Bank, 500 Woodword Ave, 24<sup>th</sup> Floor, Detroit, MI
    48226 in one lot via courier service at second beneficiary’s expense.  Please note, payment will only be effected to
    you after receipt of funds by Comerica Bank from Bank One…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Universal complied with its obligation set out therein.  Having delivered the steel, Universal
    submitted its bills of lading and invoice to Comerica.  Comerica then substituted Johnston’s invoice
    for Universal’s (as is contemplated by art. 48(i)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> of the UCP 500) and delivered these documents to the appellant.  The delivery of compliant documents by
    Comerica triggered the appellant’s obligation to pay under the letter of credit
    to its beneficiaries, which (pursuant to the transfer) now included Universal.  Universal was not required to present shipping
    documents or make a demand to the appellant for payment. In fact, its
    arrangement with Johnston Steel and Comerica prevented it from doing so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that pursuant to the terms of Comerica’s
    transfer of the letter of credit to Universal, Comerica was not a confirming
    bank, and thus made no engagement to pay.  Comerica simply transferred a portion of the letter of credit to
    Universal.  Had Comerica acted as a
    confirming bank, the situation with respect to its liability and the proper
    formulation of Universal’s claim may well have been different.  However, aside from substitution of the
    Johnston Steel invoices, Comerica’s role was simply to forward the documents
    from Universal to the appellant, and then upon receipt of payment forward the
    funds from the appellant to Universal.  Universal’s
    expert, Kenneth Oldfield, described the situation succinctly:  “Comerica was basically a post office.”  In my view, nothing in the letter of credit or
    the UCP 500 prevents the first beneficiary from making this type of arrangement.  On the contrary, such a transaction is contemplated
    by the UCP 500.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that the transfer to Universal was
    valid and effective and that as transferee, Universal is entitled to claim
    directly against the appellant, I need not deal with Universal’s submissions respecting
    Universal’s ability to sue as assignee of a <i>chose
    in action</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the issue of whether the three alleged
    discrepancies were sufficiently material to justify the appellant’s refusal of payment.  </p>

    autonomous and divorced from the underlying transactions to which they
    relate.  As alluded to above, letters of
    credit are obtained to provide the beneficiary with a secure source of payment
    that cannot be held up or otherwise delayed because of disputes concerning the

    do not appear in the relevant portion of the invoice submitted by Comerica to
    the appellant, there was material non-compliance with the terms of the letter

    justified in denying payment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the motions judge properly rejected this
    submission.  The omitted words do not
    constitute a part of the description of the goods.  Rather, they are mere surplusage.  They simply indicate that the merchandise is
    to be described by reference to purchase orders.  What followed in both the letter of credit
    and the invoices presented by Comerica was the same: “steel coils” as well as the
    listing of the same two purchase orders and the price.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal'>c)         <u>The
    failure to indicate the number of original transport documents presented to the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the claim was brought the bills of lading (or
    copies thereof) actually presented to the appellant were no longer available.  The parties agree, however, that at least
    three copies of these were presented by Comerica to the appellant.  Of these at least one was not an original and
    was marked non-negotiable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The letter of credit provided that “2/3 set plus one
    non-negotiable copy…” was to be presented to the appellant.  The transport documents presented were inland
    waterway transport documents.  They did
    not, however, indicate whether the documents were 2 out of 3 originals.  In the absence of an indication on inland
    waterway transport documents, Article 28(b) of the UCP 500 applies.  It provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the absence of any indication on the transport
    document as to the numbers issued, banks will accept the transport document(s)
    presented as constituting a full set.  Banks will accept as original(s) the transport document(s) whether
    marked as original(s) or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant therefore argues that it was deemed to be
    receiving a full set of transport documents rather than the 2/3 of a set as
    stipulated in the letter of credit.  This, in its view, constitutes a discrepancy that was sufficiently
    material to justify refusal of payment.  I disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I accept that the failure to note that the
    originals presented were 2/3 of a set constitutes a discrepancy, I do not, on
    the facts of this case, view it as being material. The concern being addressed
    by the stipulation in the letter of credit that a specified number of originals <span class=GramE>is</span> to be presented is that, in some cases, original
    transport documents can be used to control title to the goods.  In such circumstances, it is important for
    the issuing bank to know, before being called upon to pay, where the originals are
    and to what uses they have been put.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that this is the concern being addressed is
    apparent from a review of UCP 500 Articles 23 (Marine/Ocean Bill of Lading), 24
    (Non-Negotiable Sea Waybill), 25 (Charter Party Bill of Lading) and 26
    (Multimodal Transport Document).  When a
    letter of credit calls for presentation of these types of transport documents,
    the UCP 500 provides that, unless otherwise stipulated in the credit, the bank
    must ensure that the transport documents presented consist of a sole original
    or, if the transport document is issued in more than one original, the full set
    of transport documents is presented.  This requirement to ensure that all original copies are presented is in
    contrast with the Article 28(b) presumption in the case of inland waterway
    transport documents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, therefore, the concern that all
    original documents be presented does not exist.  Inland waterway transport documents are “straight” bills of lading that are
    not negotiable and provide that delivery of the goods could only be taken by
    Johnston Steel or someone authorized by it.  Article 28 treats inland waterway transport documents differently than
    transport documents addressed in Articles 23 to 26.  Article 28(b) directs that, absent any
    indication on the transport documents as to the number of originals in
    existence, the bank is to accept inland waterway transport documents presented
    to it as constituting a full set.  By
    assuming that a full set of originals is being presented, the UCP 500 signals a
    lack of concern as to the potential misuse of one set of originals.  In a sense, because the UCP 500 deems Comerica
    to have presented the full set of originals, Comerica has not only met but in
    fact exceeded the 2/3 requirement set out in the letter of credit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The immateriality of this discrepancy is further
    confirmed by the fact that the appellant’s expert could identify no practical
    implication of the transport documents being presented as they were. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal'>d)        <u>The
    inland waterway transport document does not indicate on whose behalf the agent C-River
    Logistics Inc. signed</u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bill of lading is on the letterhead of the
    “American Commercial Barge Line Company LLC”.  C-River Logistics Inc. signed it “C-River Logistics Inc. (agent)”, next
    to the word “per” on the signature line directly below the words “American
    Commercial Barge Line (carrier)”.  The
    appellant argues that this bill of lading was discrepant because C-River
    Logistics Inc. signed it but did not indicate on whose behalf it was
    signing.  In support of this argument,
    they rely on Article 28(a) of the UCP 500, which provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a credit calls for a road, rail, or inland waterway
    transport document, the banks will, unless otherwise stipulated in the Credit,
    accept a document of the type called for, however named, which:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>appears on its face to indicate the name of the carrier
    and to have been signed or otherwise authenticated by the carrier for a named
    agent for or on behalf of the carrier … An agent signing or authenticating for
    the carrier, must also indicate the name and the capacity of the party, i.e.
    carrier, on whose behalf the agent is signing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motions judge correctly rejected this
    submission.  From the relative position
    of the signature below the name of the carrier, it is apparent that the agent,
    C-River Logistics Inc., was acting as agent on behalf of the carrier named
    above the signature.  Because the word
    “(carrier)” appears immediately following “American Commercial Barge Line”, it
    is abundantly clear that American Commercial Barge Line was the carrier.  Therefore C-River Logistics Inc. is clearly
    signing as agent for American Commercial Barge Line Company and American
    Commercial Barge Line Company is the carrier.  The alleged discrepancy does not justify a refusal of payment.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>3)        <span lang=EN-US>Did
    the motions judge err in awarding costs to Universal before the amount of
    damages was determined at trial?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the motions judge committed a
    reversible error in its award of costs to Universal.  In the appellant’s view, the award was
    premature as the amount of damages, if any, had yet to be determined and would
    only be determined after the trial of an issue.  Without knowing whether Universal would recover substantial damages, it
    was impossible for the motions judge to properly assess whether its award of
    $175,000 in costs was reasonable and proportionate to the amount ultimately
    recovered.  Such a consideration is
    mandated by the rules and the case law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the motions judge erred
    when she stated that “if Universal ultimately recovers substantially less than
    the amount claimed [the] judge [fixing costs at the conclusion of the damages
    hearing] will have sufficient leeway to reflect that in the costs awarded by
    him or her”.  In the appellant’s view, because
    the award represented 95% of the costs incurred by Universal, the so-called
    “leeway” was only about $12,000, an amount insufficient should Universal
    ultimately be unable to prove substantial damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject the submissions.  Cost awards are discretionary orders and
    should only be set aside if the judge made an eror in principle or the award is
    plainly wrong:  <i>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd</i>., [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303 at para.
    27.  The motions judge considered that she
    was in the best position to determine the appropriate amount of costs for that
    portion of the case.  Because she would likely
    not be the judge assigned to hear the trial on damages, she decided to fix the
    costs of the proceeding before her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the particular circumstances of this case, it was
    open to the motions judge to make a cost award before the damages trial was
    held.  Liability pursuant to the letter
    of credit was determined and the only remaining issue was the extent to which
    Universal’s mitigation efforts succeeded in reducing the appellant’s liability
    from the full amount of the transferred letter of credit.  In the course of the damages trial,
    substantial additional cost will undoubtedly be incurred by both parties.  It follows, therefore, that, as noted by the motions
    judge, the judge hearing the damages trial will have considerable leeway to
    compensate the appellant if Universal’s damages award is substantially lower
    than the amount it now claims.  Universal
    could, conceivably, be denied its costs of the proceeding and might even be
    called upon to pay part or all of the appellant’s costs incurred at the trial of
    the damages issue should circumstances so warrant.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4)        Did the motions judge err in making a <i>Sanderson</i> order requiring the appellant
    to pay costs to Comerica?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge ordered the appellant to pay the
    costs incurred by its co-defendant, Comerica, in the amount of
    $117,996.21.  The appellant submits that
    the motions judge misapprehended the facts and incorrectly applied the test set
    out by this court in <i>Moore v</i>. <i>Wienecke</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 463 for
    determining whether a Sanderson order should be made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Moore v</i>. <i>Wienecke</i> established a two-part test.  First, the court must ask whether it was
    reasonable to join the several defendants together in one action.  Second, the court, in exercising its
    discretion, must consider whether a <i>Sanderson</i> order is just and fair in the circumstances.  In applying this second branch of the test, four factors must be
    considered:  (1) Did the defendants try
    to shift responsibility on to each other as opposed to concentrating on meeting
    the plaintiff’s case?; (2) Did the unsuccessful defendant cause the successful
    defendant to be added as a party?; (3) Were the two causes of action
    independent of each other?; and (4) Would the inability of an unsuccessful
    litigant to pay render the award unfair?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acknowledges that the first branch of the
    test has been satisfied as Universal properly included both the appellant and
    Comerica as defendants.  Comerica’s
    position was that it did all that was required of it and that it was the
    appellant that should be liable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the second branch of the test, the
    appellant argues that it is neither fair nor reasonable to require it to pay
    Comerica’s costs as it made no cross-claim against Comerica.  The appellant simply alleged that the
    documents presented were not compliant and notice to it of the transfer of the
    letter of credit was required.  It
    maintained the alleged deficiencies and the failure to give notice of the
    transfer were defences against Universal’s claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the absence of a cross-claim and the fact
    that the appellant did not specifically plead that Comerica was responsible are
    not determinative.  In effect, the
    appellant’s position was that discrepant documents were presented by Comerica,
    and that neither Comerica nor anyone else gave the notice of the transfer that
    the appellant alleged was required.  The
    appellant’s submissions therefore necessarily implied that Comerica, as the
    transferring bank, was party to errors that justified its refusal to pay
    Universal.  Comerica took a position
    directly contrary to the appellant, maintaining that it presented compliant
    documents to the appellant and notice of the transfer of the letter of credit
    to Universal did not have to be made.  This
    satisfies the requirement of responsibility shifting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, whether the appellant sought to shift
    responsibility to Comerica is but one factor to be considered.  Given the structure of the letter of credit
    and its transfer, the appellant’s refusal to pay made it necessary to include
    Comerica as a party.  Universal’s claims
    against both defendants arose from this transaction in which both played a
    central role.  The claims were therefore interrelated.  Factors two and three were thus satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the fourth factor, I would reject the
    appellant`s submission that, absent any evidence as to Universal’s financial
    situation, the motions judge ought not to have considered the risk that
    Universal might be unable to satisfy an order obligating it to pay Comerica`s
    costs.  Even in the absence of direct evidence
    of Universal’s financial situation, it was within the discretion of the motions
    judge to consider the possibility that Universal might be unable to pay. It was
    clear on the materials filed that Universal is not a large corporation.  The inference that it may have been unable to
    satisfy an order was open to the motions judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, therefore, the motions judge did not err in
    exercising her discretion to make the Sanderson order in the circumstances of
    this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, grant
    leave to appeal the order on costs, and dismiss the costs appeal.  I would award Universal its costs in this
    appeal fixed at $20,000 and Comerica its costs fixed at $4,000, both inclusive
    of GST and disbursements.</p>
