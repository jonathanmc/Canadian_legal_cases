  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal two related orders refusing to
    set aside an order of McLean J. granting the respondent child support in
    accordance with the Guidelines and setting aside a transaction whereby the
    appellant <span class=SpellE>Faramarz</span> <span class=SpellE>Manesh</span> (“<span class=SpellE>Faramarz</span>”), the former spouse, purported to
    transfer his interest in a condominium to his brother, the appellant <span
class=SpellE>Farzad</span> <span class=SpellE>Manesh</span> (“<span
class=SpellE>Farzad</span>”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that both judges (Metivier J. on
    the motion of <span class=SpellE>Faramarz</span> and Ray J. on the motion of <span
class=SpellE>Farzad</span>) erred by refusing to set aside McLean J.’s order on
    the ground that they had not been properly served and that McLean J.’s order
    was made <i>ex parte</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, we reject the appellant's
    submissions and dismiss both appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Faramarz</span> knew that the
    respondent had commenced proceedings for child support. He was served with the
    respondent’s motion to vary the divorce decree and he attended a case
    conference at which a motion to determine the matter was ordered.  After he was served and in the face of the
    respondent’s application, he transferred his condominium to <span class=SpellE>Farzad</span> in the impugned transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was some question as to <span class=SpellE>Faramarz’s</span> whereabouts after the case conference. The respondent obtained an order for
    substituted service.  Several attempts
    were made to effect service in accordance with the order.  There was evidence that the both appellants
    were aware that legal documents had been mailed to the appropriate address and
    that other efforts had been made to serve them there.  There were serious gaps in the evidence
    offered by the appellants at to their whereabouts at the relevant time.  At no time did the appellants move to set
    aside the order for substituted service.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Metivier J. noted that the motion to set aside the
    order was brought one year after it had been made following notices of appeal,
    several changes of lawyer and what she described as “a history of <span
class=SpellE>mis</span>-statements by [<span class=SpellE>Faramarz</span>]
    designed to avoid his child support obligations”.  These misstatements included evidence as to
    his whereabouts and employment status. Metivier J. rejected his evidence as
    “not credible and completely unreliable”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondent that it was open on this
    record for Metivier J. to conclude as she did that “there is strong evidence
    that the moving party in this motion and his brother deliberately evaded
    service even though it was attempted at the very address he had himself
    provided”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also agree with the respondent that Metivier J. did
    not err by finding McLean J.’s order was made on notice despite the recital in
    that order stating that it was made <i>ex
    parte</i>.  The record before McLean J.
    included the order for substituted service and the evidence of the efforts that
    had been made to serve the material for the motion. Moreover, the wording of
    McLean J.’s endorsement and the nature of the relief he granted is entirely
    inconsistent with the order having been made <i>ex parte</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor are we persuaded that we should interfere with Ray
    J.’s order dismissing <span class=SpellE>Farzad’s</span> subsequent motion to
    set aside McLean J.’s order brought on essentially the same ground as the
    previous motion before Metivier J.  While
    the proceedings against <span class=SpellE>Farzad</span> were far from a model
    of procedural perfection, we are not convinced that Ray J.’s detailed and
    careful reasons reveal any reviewable error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Farzad</span> had participated in a
    questionable transaction with his brother in the face of an application for
    child support.  He clearly knew that
    child support proceedings were pending against his brother.  It was certainly open to Ray J. to conclude
    on the evidence that it was almost certain that <span class=SpellE>Farzad</span> had been fully apprised of the relevant details, including application for
    child support and the motion before Metivier J. to set aside McLean J.’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as Ray J. noted, even if <span class=SpellE>Farzad</span> had not been not properly served, he knew of the order and he failed to explain
    why he had not moved more promptly to set it aside or why he had not joined the
    very similar application made by his brother before Metivier J., thereby
    affording himself the opportunity to attempt to re-litigate virtually the same
    issue that had been decided in that motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeals are both dismissed.  The appellant shall pay the respondent&rsquo;s costs of this appeal which are set in the amount of $8,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  The costs are related to obtaining child support and are to be enforced by the Director, Family Responsibility Office.</p>
