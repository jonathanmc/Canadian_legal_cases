    taken by the Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”) against the respondents,
    Superintendent K. MacDonald and Inspector A. Jevons, pursuant to the <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Police Services Act</span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15 (the “<i>PSA</i>”).   Both respondents were
    charged with neglect of duty.  Inspector
    Jevons was also charged with deceit.  The
    charges arose from the respondents’ internal investigation of another OPP
    officer, Detective Sergeant M. Zulinski.<a

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The disciplinary proceedings at the heart of
    this matter have a long and complicated history.  <span style='line-height:200%'>There have been only fifteen hearing days before the current
    adjudicator, all of which were occupied by pre-hearing motions.  This appeal arises from a motion for recusal
    brought by the prosecution on the basis of a reasonable apprehension of bias.  There has been no hearing on the merits.  Accordingly, what follows is a brief review
    of the uncontested facts. </span></p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 25, 2004, police were called to a
    domestic dispute involving a member of the public, Susan Cole, and her
    estranged husband, Sergeant Paul Alarie.  She alleged that he struck her car with a baseball bat.  Detective Sergeant Zulinski supervised the
    investigation.  He declined to arrest Sergeant
    Alarie and no criminal charges were laid.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result, Ms. Cole filed a public complaint against
    Sergeant Alarie under the <i>PSA</i>.  The complaint was investigated and dismissed.  She appealed to the Ontario Civilian
    Commission on Policing Services (“OCCPS”).  On February 17, 2005, an OCCPS review panel determined that there was
    sufficient evidence to charge Sergeant Alarie with discreditable conduct and
    ordered a disciplinary hearing.  They
    also ordered the OPP Professional Standards Bureau to examine the conduct of
    the investigating officers, and in particular, determine whether Detective
    Sergeant Zulinski failed to follow OPP domestic violence policies and
    procedures.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At the time, Superintendent MacDonald was the Commander of
    the Professional Standards Bureau. Inspector Jevons, then a Sergeant Major with
    the Professional Standards Bureau, was assigned to investigate Detective
    Sergeant Zulinski.  In her report, she
    found that the domestic violence policy was “clearly followed during this
    incident up to the point where an arrest should have occurred.  It was only at this juncture, that there may
    have been deviation from the policy and this essentially came down to a
    judgment call.”  She concluded that the “more
    appropriate route” would have been to arrest Sergeant Alarie and charge him
    with mischief.  Finally, she advised that
    “an educational discussion with respect to policy” had taken place and recommended
    that no further action be taken.  Superintendent
    MacDonald followed her recommendation.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ms. Cole appealed this decision to the OCCPS.  On February 3, 2006, an OCCPS review panel
    determined that there was sufficient evidence to charge Detective Sergeant
    Zulinski with neglect of duty and ordered a disciplinary hearing.  The disciplinary charges against Detective
    Sergeant Zulinski were ultimately withdrawn.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On September 14, 2006, Karl Walsh, the president of the
    Ontario Provincial Police Association (“OPPA”), filed an internal complaint regarding
    Superintendent MacDonald and Inspector Jevons.  The essence of the complaint was that the
    respondents had failed to conduct a proper investigation into Detective
    Sergeant Zulinski; a proper investigation would have exonerated him completely.  Mr. Walsh alleged that Inspector Jevons provided
    “a deficient and flawed investigative report” to the OCCPS and failed to comply
    with the <i>PSA</i>.  He further alleged that Superintendent
    MacDonald had full knowledge of these problems.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The OPPA complaint triggered an independent disciplinary
    investigation, which was conducted by OPP officers seconded from the Criminal
    Investigations Branch.  Ultimately, the
    investigators recommended that both Superintendent MacDonald and Inspector
    Jevons be charged with one count of neglect of duty, and that Inspector Jevons be
    further charged with one count of deceit.</span></p>
  <h2><i>The Disciplinary Hearing</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents were served with Notices of
    Hearing on March 15, 2007.   On July 30, 2007, Retired Superintendent M.
    Elbers presided for the limited purpose of setting a hearing date.  He had been involved in the Detective Sergeant
    Zulinski matter.  When the respondents brought
    a motion to quash the proceedings, Superintendent Elbers advised that Retired
    Superintendent N. Tweedy of the Toronto Police Service had been appointed to
    preside over the actual hearing.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On December 18, 2007, the respondents brought a motion to
    stay the proceedings on the basis of abuse of process.  The motion hearing began on January 7, 2008.  On January 8, 2008, Superintendent Tweedy
    recused himself because his close personal relationship with the Commissioner
    gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  Justice Montgomery, a retired judge of the Ontario Court of Justice, was
    appointed the new adjudicator.  He sat
    for the first time in June 2008.  On June
    10, 2008 and June 17, 2008, the respondents moved for further particulars and
    disclosure.  The motions were granted on
    June 24, 2008.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On July 8, 2008, the respondents brought a Fresh as Amended
    Notice of Motion to stay the proceedings on the basis of abuse of process.  The motion hearing began in July and carried
    over into October.  Over nine hearing
    days, four events occurred that, in the Commissioner’s view, gave rise to a
    reasonable apprehension of bias.  On
    November 5, 2008, the prosecution moved to have the adjudicator recuse
    himself.  The adjudicator dismissed the
    motion for recusal on November 10, 2008.  </span></p>

    lacked standing to bring the application for judicial review.  </p>

    that he could not give an undertaking that Inspector Messham would not be
    charged with a contravention of s.&nbsp;80 of the <i>PSA</i>. The appellant submits that the adjudicator’s comments

    the record and concluded at para. 37:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The fairest view of the exchange, as regards the

    it appeared little progress with the hearing had been made, the Adjudicator
    expressed his frustration that a great deal of time had been wasted.  Judges and counsel know that such things
    happen from time to time.  Hearings
    sometimes take unexpected turns and that, compounded by the complexity of the
    law, can result in the expenditure of more time than expected.  Reasonable counsel would perceive the comment
    about a waste of time to be an admonition to them to try to avoid falling into
    the trap of such time-consuming complications unnecessarily.  Judges give such admonitions to counsel often
    enough that experienced counsel should know that this goes with the nature of
    the work and is not to be taken personally.</p>

    third event occurred in response to the possibility that during his testimony, the
    Commissioner had disregarded the adjudicator’s ruling that he could not use a
    particular exhibit to refresh his memory.  The adjudicator indicated that he was disturbed by what had occurred,
    that it was “getting close to professional conduct” and that it was “something
    I’ll have to deal with when I come to do my thing”. The Divisional Court rejected
    the submission that this incident gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias and noted, at para. 84, that the adjudicator said he was “not pointing the
    finger” at counsel for the prosecution. The adjudicator, held the court, was
    entitled to indicate his concern and, at para. 85, the court found:  “<span lang=EN>It was surely in order for the Adjudicator to put counsel on notice this
    way so that they could consider how best to address the issue</span>”. The court rejected, at para. 86, the
    contention that the adjudicator’s comments indicated that he had effectively
    made an adverse credibility finding against the Commissioner: “<span
lang=EN>He opened the issue; he did not close
    it”.&nbsp; The court concluded, at para. 89:</span><span lang=EN> </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The rulings that the Adjudicator made on the issue
    of the Commissioner's answers were, in the context of the objections raised by
    the Respondents and in view of the gratuitous response of the Commissioner
    after the recess, reasonably made in the circumstances.  For the above reasons, the actions of the
    Adjudicator relating to the testimony of the Commissioner do not give rise to a
    reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>

    fourth and final event was triggered by a statement by the prosecutor in answer
    to a question from the adjudicator about the prosecution’s apparent change of
    position when, shortly after discussing the timetable for the hearing, the
    prosecutor brought the recusal motion. The prosecutor stated that the reason
    was that he had had some discussion with counsel at the Ministry of the
    Attorney General and had been told that the Attorney General would support the
    prosecution “in the event of taking any further steps”, thereby clearly
    implying that the prosecutor had elicited the support of the Attorney General
    for a judicial review application should the adjudicator refuse to recuse
    himself. In his recusal ruling, the adjudicator described the prosecutor’s
    comments as “<span lang=EN>highly improper”
    and “particularly shocking since at the time they were made I had not yet made
    a decision to voluntarily remove myself or not”. He further stated that they
    might appear to be an “attempt to pressure and to intimidate a judicial
    officer”.&nbsp;  </span></p>

    Divisional Court observed that while the prosecutor’s comments may have been
    responsive to the adjudicator’s question, the relevance of the Attorney
    General’s position was, at para. 122, <span lang=EN>“not evident” </span>as the
    prosecution was obliged to raise the issue of bias as soon as the apprehension
    of bias arose, <span lang=EN>and that “it
    would have been reasonable for the Adjudicator to wonder why that support was
    mentioned”. While the adjudicator’s remarks could, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    125, “[a]t first blush” appear to amount to “an overreaction and a reason to
    apprehend bias”, they were more properly viewed as being directed at the
    prosecutor’s “specific impugned remarks” rather than at his professional
    standing. &nbsp;The court concluded, </span>at para. 126, that when considered in the light of all the circumstances:  “[T]he Adjudicator’s reaction to the
    impugned remarks was reasonable.  That
    reaction does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.” </p>

    suggest that a reasonably conducted hearing or a reasonable ruling can give
    rise to an apprehension of bias.  Moreover,
    I am not persuaded that there is any reason to disagree with the Divisional
    Court’s characterization of the adjudicator’s response to the four incidents
    that were raised in support of the application for judicial review and that
    formed the basis for this appeal. Whether considered individually or
    cumulatively, those incidents fall well short of supporting the claim of
    reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
