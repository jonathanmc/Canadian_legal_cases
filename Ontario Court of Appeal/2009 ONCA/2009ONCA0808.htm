'>[1]</span></span></span></a> (the “Act”) place the responsibility upon the landlord to ensure that
    accumulations of ice and snow are removed from exterior common areas.  This appeal concerns the validity of a provision
    in a tenancy agreement that provides that the tenant shall be responsible for
    snow removal.  The landlord relies on the
    provision in his defence against the tenant’s negligence action.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Factual Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant tenant commenced an action against a respondent
    landlord for damages after slipping and falling on the premises.  In her claim, the tenant pleads that on
    January 30, 2003 she slipped on ice on the walkway leading to her basement
    apartment and suffered injury.  In his
    defence the landlord pleads that the Conditions of Lease (the tenancy agreement
    between the parties dated July 7, 2002), provides that: “Tenants are
    responsible for keeping their walkway and stairway clean (including snow
    removal).”  Based on this provision, he
    pleads further that the tenant’s injury was due to her own negligence in that
    “she failed to keep her walkway in a state of good repair, including free from
    snow and ice”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The landlord brought a motion to determine before trial
    the question of law whether the provision of the tenancy agreement is void
    because it is inconsistent with the Act.  Taking the position that the provision is void, the tenant brought a
    cross-motion to strike out the paragraphs in the statement of defence that
    relied on the provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge reasoned that it would be absurd to
    find that a tenant may never consent to participating in any snow removal
    tasks.  She accepted the landlord’s
    argument that “landlords may fulfill their statutory obligations by delegating
    snow removal tasks to others”.  She
    concluded that “the Act and associated regulations do not state that snow
    removal tasks may never be assumed by a tenant and, as such, the Conditions of
    Lease executed by the Tenant are not inconsistent with the Act and should not
    be considered to be void.”  She granted
    an order that the tenancy agreement provides that “the Tenant will complete
    snow removal tasks with respect to the stairwell area is not inconsistent with
    the Act.”  She dismissed the tenant’s
    cross-motion. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Statutory
    Framework</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:
normal'> <i>The Act</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sub-section 2 (1) and section 16 of the Act provide: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>2.(</span>1) This Act
    applies with respect to rental units in residential complexes, despite any
    other Act and despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16. Subject to section
    181, a provision in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with this Act or
    the regulations is void.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exception in section 181 is not relevant.  It relates to mediated settlements of matters
    that are the subject of applications under the Act.  </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Regulations</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario Regulation 198/98 (the “Regulations”), since
    revoked and replaced by Ontario Regulation 517/06, is entitled “Maintenance
    Standards” and prescribes maintenance standards to residential units in the
    circumstances defined by s. 154 (1) of the Act.  It is common ground that the Regulations apply to the premises in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sub-section 2(2) of the Regulations states that except
    as otherwise provided, “the landlord shall ensure that the maintenance
    standards in this Regulation are complied with.”  Various parts of the Regulations deal with
    “structural elements”, “utilities and services” such as plumbing, electrical,
    heating, lighting and ventilation, “safety and security”, and “general maintenance”.  Sub-section 26 (1) of the Regulations, which
    is under the part relating to Safety and Security, provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Exterior common areas shall be maintained in a
    condition suitable for their intended use and free of hazards and, for these
    purposes, the following shall be removed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.  Unsafe accumulations of ice and snow.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the observation of the motion judge that
    the legislation only requires the landlord to “ensure” exterior common areas
    are free of unsafe accumulations of ice and snow.  It does not prohibit a landlord from
    satisfying this statutory obligation by retaining others to provide the
    required services.  Specifically, it does
    not prohibit a landlord from contracting with a tenant to perform snow removal
    tasks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This, however, is not enough to conclude as the motion
    judge did, that the particular provision between the landlord and tenant in this
    case may be declared to be “not inconsistent” with the Act.  That the Act does not prohibit a landlord
    from contracting with a tenant for snow removal services does not mean that every
    provision that addresses snow removal by a tenant is consistent with the Act.  It remains necessary to consider the import
    of the provision in issue and determine if it creates a contractual obligation to
    which s. 16 of the Act does not apply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the provision in this case, I begin by
    observing that, read literally, it addresses the “responsibility” for snow
    removal, without specifying any services to be provided by the tenant.  By providing that tenants are “responsible”
    for snow removal, the clause clashes with the legislation that places that
    responsibility squarely on the landlord.  Thus, if taken literally, the clause would be inconsistent with the Act
    and void pursuant to s. 16.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize, however, that the parties and the motion
    judge did not interpret the provision literally, but understood it to assign the
    task of snow removal to tenants.  As the motion
    judge put it, the provision “indicates that the Tenant will complete snow
    removal tasks.” I continue the analysis on that basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to be effective, a clause that provides that a
    tenant will provide snow removal services must constitute a contractual
    obligation severable from the tenancy agreement.  The reason such a clause must be able to
    stand alone as an enforceable contract is because s. 16 of the Act voids
    provisions of tenancy agreements that are inconsistent with the Act<i> </i>or Regulations.  The Act<i> </i>and Regulations make clear that in the landlord and tenant relationship,
    the landlord is responsible for keeping the common walkways free of snow and
    ice.  Therefore, it cannot be a term of
    the tenancy that the <span class=GramE>tenant complete</span> snow removal
    tasks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This does not mean that the landlord cannot contract
    with the tenant as a service provider to perform snow removal tasks.  It does mean, however, that the clause under
    which the tenant agrees to provide such services, even if included in the same
    document as the tenancy agreement, must create a severable contractual obligation.  The severable contractual obligation, while
    it cannot transfer the landlord’s statutory responsibility to ensure
    maintenance standards are met, may support the landlord’s claim over against
    the tenant in contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the provision is inextricable from the tenancy
    agreement.  It does not indicate a
    definite consideration for the snow removal task separate from the provision of
    the premises.  As well, a consideration
    of the context leads me to conclude, it is too indefinite to create an
    autonomous contract for services.  The
    tenant lives in one of several basement apartments of a multi-unit residential
    complex.  The provision vaguely places the
    task of snow removal “from their walkway and stairway” on tenants jointly.  It does not set out specifically what part of
    the complex’s common walkways this tenant agrees to keep clean and does not
    stipulate on what schedule she should perform the joint obligation.  The provision fails to define this individual
    tenant’s task clearly enough to create an enforceable contractual obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Landlords cannot fulfill their statutory duty to ensure
    the prescribed maintenance standards are met by provisions as ill-defined as
    this one.  As I see it, this vague provision,
    even reading it as did the motion judge is nothing more than an impermissible
    attempt by the landlord to avoid his statutory obligations.  I would conclude the provision is not
    consistent with the Act<i> </i>and is void.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would allow the appeal.  I would set
    aside the order of the motion judge and replace it with an order declaring that
    clause 9 of the Conditions of Lease is void as inconsistent wi</span>th the <i>Act</i> and striking out paragraphs 3 and 5
    (a) of the Statement of Defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs in favour of the tenant are fixed in the amount
