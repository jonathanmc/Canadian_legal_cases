  <p class=headingNUMBER><a name=Text11>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The app</a>ellant raises three issues on appeal.  First, the appellant submits that the
    application judge erred in holding that London South Purchaseco Inc. (now Royal
    Host Hotels GP Inc.) acquired title to the 50-foot commercial sign on the land
    retained by the vendor when London South purchased the motel property in
    1998.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that because the sign was not
    included in Schedule C to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and because the
    parties contemplated entering into a licence agreement with respect to the sign,
    it was not open to the application judge, in interpreting the Agreement of
    Purchase and Sale in a commercially reasonable fashion, to hold that the sign
    was included in the sale as a chattel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    Agreement of Purchase and Sale makes it clear that Schedule C is not meant to
    be exhaustive.  Moreover, the definition
    of “chattels” in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale includes “signage … off site
    advertising … and other tangible personal property utilized on a going concern
    basis, whether or not within the Buildings, belonging to the Vendor and used in
    the building and the business.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the vendor in the 1998 transaction and London South
    both understood that the sign was transferred by the Agreement of Purchase and
    Sale<span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;'> </span><span style='line-height:200%;'>and that the easement for ingress and egress allowed placement</span> and maintenance of the sign.  This
    evidence was provided by the lawyers for both sides to the transaction.  No objection was taken to the admissibility
    of this evidence either before the application judge or on appeal and it is not
    contested that the application judge was entitled to consider this evidence in
    construing the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the particular context, which involved the
    purchase of an otherwise landlocked property for $7.1 million and the fact that
    the sign in issue marked the entrance to the easement providing access to the motel,
    we are not persuaded that the application judge’s conclusions that the sign was
    included in the sale was commercially unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the evidence provided by the lawyers on the
    1998 transaction made it clear that the easement for ingress and egress was also
    intended to permit placement of the sign as well as access to it for maintenance
    and servicing. In our opinion, the application judge appears to have
    misapprehended this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paragraph 13 of his reasons, the application judge
    stated, “for reasons that are not clear, the transaction closed without the
    parties further addressing the contemplated licence agreements”. However, according
    to the transaction lawyers the licence agreements contemplated by the Agreement
    of Purchase and Sale were addressed through the transfer of the sign to London
    South and through the easement agreements that permitted the sign to be placed
    on the vendor’s property and provided London South with access to it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the unique circumstances that prevailed in this
    case, the transaction lawyers’ evidence makes eminent commercial sense.  The sign in issue was an integral part of the
    motel business and the easement because without it the travelling public would
    be unaware of the motel or how to get to it. Without the sign, the easement
    would be of significantly diminished value.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had the application judge properly appreciated the
    evidence in this matter he would have concluded that the easements provided a
    full and complete answer to the issue of London South’s interest in the
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of our conclusion, we find it unnecessary to
    consider the second and third arguments raised by the appellant concerning
    proprietary estoppel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result the appeal is dismissed. However, the
    judgment is varied in accordance with these reasons so that paragraph 3 is
    varied as set out below and so that it contains a Schedule ‘A’ setting out the
    legal description of the parties’ lands:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[3] This Court declares and adjudges that the
    easement in instrument LT524358 registered on title to the properties described
    in Schedule “A” permits the owner of the Respondents’ Lands as described
    Schedule “A”, to locate and maintain the Travelodge sign in its present
    location on part of the Applicant’s Lands, described as Part 4, Plan 33 R-13433
    for the City of London.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the appeal are to the respondent on a partial
    indemnity scale fixed in the amount of $12,500 inclusive of disbursements and
    G.S.T.</p>
