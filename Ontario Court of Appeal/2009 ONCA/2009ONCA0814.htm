  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Samuel <span class=SpellE>Dineley</span> was acquitted of impaired driving and driving over 80 on July 24, 2008.  The trial judge ruled that the amendments to
    s. 258(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which
    changed the so-called ‘<i>Carter</i> defence’ for a driving over 80 charge, did not apply retrospectively to
    offences committed before the coming into force date of July 2, 2008.  The summary conviction appeal judge reached
    the same conclusion about the retrospective operation of the amendments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals the latter decision.  Its position is that the amendments to s.
    258(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> apply
    retrospectively to offences committed before July 2, 2008, at trials commenced
    or continuing after that date.  This
    issue is an important one: in Ontario there are approximately 3000 cases in
    this category.  Moreover, there have
    already been over 50 decisions, going both ways, in the Ontario provincial and
    superior courts, and scores of decisions, again going both ways, in the courts
    in other provinces in Canada.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The
    events</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 21, 2007, Samuel <span class=SpellE>Dineley</span> went to a nightclub to drink with several <span class=GramE>friends</span>.  Early the following morning, he returned to
    his parents’ car.  Soon after he started
    driving, the car mounted a curb and struck a parked vehicle.  The police arrived to investigate the
    accident.  They conducted breath tests
    that produced blood alcohol concentrations of 99 and 97 (rounded to 90) mg/100 <span
class=SpellE>mL</span> of blood.  <span
class=SpellE>Dineley</span> was charged with impaired driving and driving over
    80.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    statutory framework</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 2, 2008, s. 258 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> was amended by the <i>Tackling Violent Crime Act</i>, S.C. 2008, c. 6 (“Bill C-2”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amended s. 258(1)(c) reads, in relevant parts:</p>

    pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3),</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN>. . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>evidence of the results of the analyses so made is
    conclusive proof that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood both
    at the time when the analyses were made and at the time when the offence was
    alleged to have been committed was, if the results of the analyses are the
    same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, if the results of the
    analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations determined by the
    analyses, in the absence of evidence tending to show all of the following three
    things — that the approved instrument was malfunctioning or was operated
    improperly, that the malfunction or improper operation resulted in the
    determination that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood exceeded
    80 mg of alcohol in 100 <span class=SpellE>mL</span> of blood, and that the
    concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood would not in fact have exceeded
    80 mg of alcohol in 100 <span class=SpellE>mL</span> of blood at the time when
    the offence was alleged to have been committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The newly enacted s. 258(1)(<i>d</i>.01) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(<i>d</i>.01<span
class=GramE>)for</span> greater certainty, evidence tending to show that an
    approved instrument was malfunctioning or was operated improperly, or that an

    include evidence of</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amended s. 258(1)(<i>d</i>.1) provides:</p>

    of alcohol in blood exceeding 80 mg of alcohol in 100 <span class=SpellE>mL</span> of blood, evidence of the results of the analyses is proof that the
    concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood at the time when the offence
    was alleged to have been committed exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are no transitional provisions in Bill C-2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effects of these amendments have been well and
    succinctly described by Brewer J. in <i>R.
    v. Mariano</i> (2008), 77 M.V.R. (5th) 234 (Ont. C.J.), at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    2-5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the time that this offence allegedly occurred,
    section 258 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> enabled the prosecution to establish certain facts by way of presumptions.  In particular, once certain preconditions
    were met, section 258(1)(c) and (d.1) provided Crown counsel with a statutory
    shortcut by deeming that, where the lower result of the two breath samples
    taken from an accused exceeded the legal limit, her blood alcohol concentration
    at the time the offence alleged occurred was presumed to be at the same
    level.  By this means the prosecutor
    avoided having to call expert evidence to relate the results of the accused’s
    breath tests back to the time that she was driving or in care and control of a
    motor vehicle.  This is known as the
    presumption of identity.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The presumption of identity was available to the
    Crown in the absence of “evidence to the contrary” namely evidence capable of
    raising a reasonable doubt about the accused’s blood alcohol level at the time
    of the offence.  In the past, evidence to
    the contrary typically consisted of testimony from the accused, and sometimes
    other witnesses, about her pattern of drinking prior to driving, along with
    evidence from a toxicologist indicating that, if the accused had consumed the
    amount she claimed, her blood alcohol level at the time of the offence would
    have been below the legal limit…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Pursuant to the <i>Tackling
    Violent Crime Act</i>, S.C. 2008, c. 6 (Bill C-2), which was enacted on July 2,
    2008, section 258(1)(c) now provides that the result of the accused’s lowest
    breath test is conclusive proof of her blood alcohol concentration at the time
    of the offence, in the absence of evidence tending to show:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the approved instrument malfunctioned or was
    improperly operated;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the malfunction or error resulted in the “over
    80” result; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>the</span> accused’s blood
    alcohol concentration would not have exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
    millilitres of blood at the time she was driving or in care and control of a
    motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition, section
    258(d.01) precludes testimony with respect to the accused’s alcohol consumption
    or her rate of elimination or a calculation of the accused’s blood alcohol
    concentration premised on those factors from being advanced as evidence tending
    to show a problem with either the breath testing equipment or the testing
    procedure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where no challenge is
    being made to the accuracy of the results of the accused’s breath tests, the
    amended section 258(d.1) permits the introduction of evidence that gives rise
    to the possibility that something, apart from normal biological processes,
    happened between the time of the alleged offence and the time of the breath
    tests that could have affected the accused’s blood alcohol concentration.  As an example, an accused person can still
    rebut the presumption of identity by leading evidence of bolus drinking or
    post-offence drinking.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (3) <u>The
    trial</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial commenced on June 19, 2008.  The Crown case was completed that day.  The defence case would have been completed if
    the defence had been permitted to file its toxicology report.  However, the Crown indicated that it wanted
    to cross-examine the toxicologist so the trial was adjourned to July 15, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the trial resumed, the Crown pointed out that s.
    258 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> had been
    amended as of July 2, 2008, and attempted to submit that the effect of the
    amendments was to render the proposed toxicology evidence irrelevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not permit the Crown to advance
    this argument.  In his oral reasons dated
    July 24, 2008, he explained his earlier ruling: “It would be contrary to the
    proper administration of justice as well as the principles of fundamental
    justice and fairness to permit the Crown to raise the issue at this stage of
    the proceedings.”  After hearing the
    evidence relating to the <i>Carter</i> defence, the trial judge acquitted the accused on both charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown did not appeal the acquittal for impaired
    driving.  However, it did appeal the
    acquittal for driving over 80 on the basis that the trial judge erred by not allowing
    the Crown to argue the <span class=SpellE>retrospectivity</span> issue and,
    therefore, in effect holding that Bill C-2 did not apply retrospectively to
    offences committed before July 2, 2008, but involving trials commencing or
    continuing after that date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge concluded that it
    was not improper for the Crown to raise the <span class=SpellE>retrospectivity</span> issue when the trial resumed on July 15, 2008.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge held that Bill C-2
    did not apply retrospectively.  After a
    careful analysis, he expressed his conclusion in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I would, therefore, characterize Bill C-2 as
    creating a hybrid presumption that falls between a rebuttable and a conclusive
    presumption.  The presumption is clothed
    in the language of a rebuttable presumption.  The presumption, however, takes on aspects of a conclusive presumption
    by providing that evidence which, as a matter of logic and reason, is evidence
    to the contrary is deemed insufficient.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The amendments in question impinge and, in fact,
    virtually eliminate a defence.  To the
    extent that the amendments provide for a conclusive presumption they are
    substantive law and not exclusively procedural.  In accordance with well established principles Parliament must,
    therefore, be taken to have intended that the amendments have prospective
    effect only.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>It followed that the summary
    conviction appeal judge dismissed the appeal from the acquittal entered by the
    trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals the summary conviction appeal judge’s
    decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        <u>ISSUE</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue on the appeal is whether the amendments
    to s. 258(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> operate retrospectively.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D.        <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The framework within which the temporal operation of a
    statute must be considered was set out by Robins J.A. of this court in <i>R. v. Bickford</i> (1989), 34 O.A.C. 34, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 11:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a matter of fundamental principle, a statute is
    not to be construed as having a retrospective operation unless such a
    construction is made evident by its terms or arises by necessary
    implication.  However, the presumption
    against retrospective construction has no application to enactments which
    relate only to procedural or evidentiary matters.  Speaking generally, no person can be said to
    have a vested right in procedure or a right in the manner of proof that may be
    used against him: <i>Howard Smith Paper

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown contends that the summary conviction appeal
    judge erred in two respects: (1) by distinguishing, rather than following and
    applying, this court’s decision in <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Rigitano</span></i>, [1999] O.J. No. 997; and (2) by concluding
    that the Bill C-2 amendments virtually eliminate an existing defence and are
    therefore substantive law and not exclusively procedural.  I will address these arguments in turn.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rigitano</span></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE><i>Rigitano</i></span> dealt with the issue whether the former s. 258(1)(<i>d</i>.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    the so-called “<i>St. Pierre</i> amendments”
    (because they were intended to overrule the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision
    in <i>R. v. St. Pierre</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R.
    791) were procedural and therefore operated retrospectively.  This issue had been thoroughly canvassed by
    Fairgrieve J. of the Ontario Court of Justice in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Cvitkovic</span></i> (1998), 31 M.V.R. (3d)
    271.  Fairgrieve J.’s conclusion, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 23, was that “the enactment of s. 258(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>d.1) simply added a new evidentiary provision defining a
    method of proof.  As such, it should
    properly be characterized as procedural rather than substantive in nature.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the same issue came before this court in <span
class=SpellE><i>Rigitano</i></span>, in a
    short endorsement, Doherty J.A. said, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 1: “We
    agree with the analysis in [<span class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span>].  Section
    258(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>d.1) is an evidentiary provision and was
    therefore applied at the appellant’s trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge was aware of <span
class=SpellE><i>Rigitano</i></span>: “If the
    logic in <span class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span> applies, that dictates the result.”  However, he declined to follow these cases because he thought that <span
class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span> was
    distinguishable from the case before him:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In essence, <span class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span> holds that a presumption that may be rebutted by
    evidence to the contrary operates retrospectively.  The presumption created by Bill C-2 cannot be
    rebutted simply by logical and probative evidence to the contrary, but requires
    specified types of evidence. <span class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span> is distinguishable on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not accept this attempt to
    distinguish <span class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span> and <span class=SpellE><i>Rigatano</i></span>.  In my view, both the <i>St. Pierre</i> amendments and the new amendments are essentially
    evidentiary in nature.  They differ in
    degree, but not in kind.  As expressed by
    Pringle J. in <i>R. v. Ng</i>, 2008 ONCJ 534,
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is little doubt that these amendments go much
    farther than those challenged in <span class=SpellE><i>Cvitkovic</i></span>, and require even more evidence to the contrary
    than before.  However, I agree with the
    Crown’s submission that the amendments don’t take away the <i>Carter</i> defence, they simply add to its requirements.  The accused may still call evidence that his
    consumption was such that his breath readings should have been under the legal
    limit at the time of driving; but in addition to that, he will have to point to
    an instrument or operator mistake that would have resulted in the breath
    readings he says are erroneous.  Whether
    the additions to the law fatally impede the defence ability to make full answer
    and defence or amount to an unjustifiable reverse onus provision will need to
    be considered by another court in relation to the constitutional
    arguments.  <i>However, at this stage, I don’t believe that the extent of the
    additional requirements changes their essential evidentiary character as
    identified in <span class=SpellE>Cvitkovic</span> and confirmed in <span
class=SpellE>Rigitano</span>.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>Elimination
    of a <span class=SpellE>defence</span></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The amendments in question impinge and, in fact, <i>virtually eliminate</i> a defence.  To the extent that the amendments provide for
    a conclusive presumption they are substantive law and not exclusively
    procedural.  In accordance with well
    established principles Parliament must, therefore, be taken to have intended
    that the amendments have prospective effect only.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In several other cases in which courts have held that
    Bill C-2 should apply only prospectively, judges have used similar language to
    describe the recent amendments to s. 258 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  For example, in <i>R. v. E. (P.L.)</i> (2008), 79 M.V.R. (5th)
    144 (Ont. S.C.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 27, the court described the <i>Carter</i> defence as “effectively
    neutered”.  And in <i>R. v. McDonald</i>, 2008 ONCJ 536, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    12, the court said that “the defence has for all practical purposes been
    abolished <i>because the requirements appear
    to be impossible for the defence to meet</i>.”  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, these descriptions strike me as both
    speculative and overstated.  The <i>Carter</i> defence has not been virtually
    eliminated, neutered or abolished.  It
    has been changed, but it survives in a different form, subject as always to the
    ingenuity of defence lawyers and the new jurisprudence that the courts will
    inevitably enunciate.  As explained by
    Pringle J. in <i>Ng</i> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]<span class=SpellE>t’s</span> true that the
    amendments redirect the defence to a new area and require it to address the
    reliability of the approved instrument in order to secure an acquittal.  However, the legislation doesn’t direct the
    content of the evidence necessary to raise a reasonable doubt:  the defence is free to achieve this through
    cross-examination of the operator, pointing to an error on the face of the test
    records, or reliance on a problem with, for example, <span class=GramE>the</span> alcohol standard solution.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3) <u>Conclusion</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that in support of his argument that Bill
    C-2 applies prospectively to offences committed on or after July 2, 2008, the
    respondent relies on <i>Angus v. Sun
    Alliance Insurance Co.</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256 and <i>R. v. Boucher</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 499.  In both cases, when considering the temporal operation of legislation,
    the Supreme Court of Canada commented on legislation that has the effect of
    altering the content of an existing common law defence: see <i>Angus</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    21 and <i>Boucher</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    22.  In my opinion, however, read in
    their entirety, neither case stands for the proposition that legislation which
    merely alters the evidentiary content of a defence, rather than removing or
    eliminating an existing defence, compels a prospective application.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E.        <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and
    order a new trial to proceed on the basis of s. 258(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as amended and currently
    in force.</p>
