style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury found the appellant guilty of robbery, using an imitation firearm
    while committing robbery, unlawful confinement and assault causing bodily harm
    arising out of her conduct during a home invasion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s liability was left to the jury on the alternative grounds
    that she aided the two principals in committing each offence charged or that
    she was a party to the principals’ offences under s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> because she formed a common intention with them to commit and to help
    them commit robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The submissions Mr. Di Luca advances on the appellant’s behalf attack
    both the organization and the substance of the trial judge’s final instructions
    on the grounds of the appellant’s liability, as well as the use jurors could
    make of a remark attributed to one of the principals during the home invasion –
    “We have no more use for the bitch”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Di Luca says that the trial judge’s final instructions were fatally
    flawed in that they:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.            were
    so confusing and disjointed that they failed to provide the jurors with the
    proper legal basis upon which to determine the appellant’s liability;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         failed
    to apprise the jurors of the essential elements of each offence   with
    which she was charged; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       failed
    adequately to instruct the jury on the objective foreseeability component
    in s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>;  and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.     failed
    adequately to instruct the jury about the use they could make of the remark “We
    have no more use for the bitch” and, more generally, the words and conduct of
    the principals during the home invasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant that the trial judge’s final instructions did
    not clearly or correctly explain to the jury the legal basis upon which the
    appellant’s liability fell to be determined.  In the circumstances, I find it
    unnecessary to consider the final ground of appeal raised by Mr. Di Luca.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate courts must assess the adequacy of a trial judge’s
    instructions in a functional way.  We are required to test those instructions,
    viewed as a whole, against their ability to fulfil the purpose for which final
    instructions are given.  We do not gauge the adequacy of final instructions by
    calibrating the precise extent to which they adhere to or depart from any
    particular approach or formula. That said, a sound, systematic and organized
    approach to final instructions will go a long way to facilitating jury
    understanding, rather than getting in its way:  <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 43
    O.R. (3d) 378 (C.A.), at p. 386.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecution’s case against the appellant, who stood trial alone, was
    that she answered a telephone call the complainant made to an escort agency.  Once
    in the complainant’s home, having concluded some preliminary negotiations and
    activities, the appellant went downstairs on the pretence of getting a drink of
    water.  She unlocked the door to the house.  By pre-arrangement, the principals
    entered the residence, handcuffed and beat the complainant with the butt of an
    imitation firearm, and ransacked the premises, taking various items with them
    as they left, closely followed by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge introduced the grounds upon which the prosecutor relied
    to establish the appellant’s liability as “aiding” and “common purpose”.  He
    explained the requirements of each, first briefly, but then more expansively,
    in general terms, without any reference to the specific offences charged.  In
    discussing the various steps the jury should follow to determine liability
    under s. 21(2), the trial judge furnished a flawed and incomplete example of
    the fault requirement and provided no direction about the elements of any
    offence charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the essential
    elements of the offences charged (the offences of using an imitation firearm
    while committing robbery, unlawful confinement and assault causing bodily harm)
    was rooted in the agreement of trial counsel that no such instruction was
    necessary since it was clear that the principals, who were not on trial,
    committed each of these offences.  Unfortunately, the effect of this agreement
    was to deprive those who were deciding the case, the jury, of any instructions
    on the essential elements the prosecutor had to prove to establish the
    appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As statements of general principle about an accused’s liability as an
    aider or in accordance with the common purpose doctrine for which s. 21(2)
    provides, much of what the trial judge said is unexceptionable.  But the
    failure here was to apply the general to the specific, to link aiding and the common
    purpose doctrine to the specific offences with which the appellant was charged,
    and to tell the jury what findings were required before the appellant’s guilt
    was established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final instructions also contain an unfortunate commingling of the
    alternative grounds of liability: a portion on aiding, followed by a bit about
    common purpose, then some more about aiding, followed by a more elaborate
    examination of common purpose, all at a general or abstract level without any linkage
    to the specific offences charged.  In later portions of the charge, the trial
    judge introduced new and different language to describe the same concepts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A more specific problem arises in connection with the trial judge’s application
    of s. 21(2).  The “unlawful purpose” in s. 21(2) must be different from the “offence”
    the principal commits in carrying out the common purpose: <i>R. v. Simpson</i>,
    [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 15.  In this instance, the same robbery cannot serve
    as both the “unlawful purpose” and the “offence”.  If s. 21(2) applied at all
    in this case, the more appropriate “unlawful purpose” may have been a home
    invasion or the unlawful entry offence of s. 349(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the jury was properly
    instructed on the legal principles that they were to apply to determine whether
    the prosecutor had established  the  appellant’s guilt of the offences
    charged.  I would allow the appeal from onviction, quash the convictions entered at trial and
    order a new trial. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the
    appeal from sentence.</p>
