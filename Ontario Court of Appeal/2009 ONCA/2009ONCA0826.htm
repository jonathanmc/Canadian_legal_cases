  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the disposition of the
    Ontario Review Board dated April 2, 2009, which ordered that the appellant be
    detained at the medium secure unit at the Centre for Addiction and Mental
    Health, Queen Street Site, pursuant to certain terms and conditions and
    allowing for a variety of limited potential privileges, up to and including
    entering the community of Toronto in the company of staff or approved persons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeared on the appeal representing <span
class=GramE>himself</span>. Amicus curiae also made submissions on behalf of
    the appellant. Both counsel for the hospital and for the Attorney General also
    made submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sought an absolute discharge, or in the
    alternative a conditional discharge, and in the further alternative a minimum
    security order so that he can go back to the community and continue his work in
    high level physics.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Amicus challenged the failure of the Board to order a
    hybrid disposition that would have allowed the hospital to move the appellant
    from medium to minimum security at its discretion. Amicus argued that as all of
    the psychiatrists testified that they recommended this disposition and that it
    was warranted based on the appellant’s prognosis of future improvement, the Board’s
    failure to make the order was a breach of the requirement to make the least
    onerous and least restrictive order. Counsel for the hospital made a similar
    submission. Crown counsel sought to uphold the Board’s disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s disposition was based on the following
    conclusion at p. 12 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board is not persuaded by the evidence put
    forward at this hearing that there is a good foundation of evidence to justify
    a hybrid order placing the accused on a medium secure unit and delegating the
    responsibility of a subsequent move to the person in charge at CAMH.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board, as an expert tribunal, was entitled to
    reject the evidence of the psychiatrists and form its own conclusions regarding
    the efficacy of a hybrid order in the case of the appellant and whether such an
    order would protect the public, based on the record before it.  The Board was no doubt concerned that the
    relatively short period of time (less than a month) over which the appellant
    had shown significant improvement did not provide an adequate basis for the
    hybrid order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Board went on to state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is respectfully suggested that if the accused
    makes the progress hoped for by his caregivers to the point that such a move
    can be undertaken that an early review be requested in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral submissions, counsel advised at the request of
    the court for an update since the hearing, that in fact, in September 2009 the
    hospital did request an early review in order to seek a move to minimum
    security for the appellant. However, to date no hearing has been scheduled by
    the Board. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We often see such suggestions in orders of the Board.
    Indeed, this court itself from time to time may include a similar suggestion in
    its own reasons. It is essential that this suggestion, which forms part of the
    disposition by the board or this court, be acted upon expeditiously in every
    case. Otherwise, it becomes effectively meaningless when review hearings are
    required to be held every 12 months in any event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal from the disposition of the
    Board is dismissed but the Board is ordered to convene forthwith the early
    review hearing requested in September and, in any event, within 30 days of the
    release of these reasons.</p>
