  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises the question of whether the
    subrogation right of an insurer under the Standard Mortgage Clause in an
    insurance policy may be exercised simply upon the insurer paying the loss award
    to the mortgagee without the insurer establishing that it has no liability to
    the insured.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude there are two preconditions to the insurer’s
    entitlement to subrogation under the Standard Mortgage Clause.  First, the insurer must make payment of the
    loss award, or part of it, to the mortgagee.  Second, the insurer must establish a claim that it has no liability to
    the mortgagor insured.  This conclusion flows
    from the construction of the Standard Mortgage Clause and is not dependent on
    the specific facts of this case. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 2004, there was a fire at the home of
    the appellants, Joyce and Cindy <span class=SpellE>Pinder</span>.  The <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> jointly
    held a policy of insurance with the respondent, Farmers’ Mutual Insurance Company
    (Lindsay) (“Farmers’ Mutual”).  The house
    was owned solely by Joyce <span class=SpellE>Pinder</span> and was subject to a
    five-year mortgage with the Bank of Montreal for the principal amount of
    $106,344 with a maturity date of August 1, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 29, 2004, the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> submitted a claim to Farmers’ Mutual seeking $302,412 for repairs to the house,
    damage to their contents and additional living expenses.  Farmers’ Mutual denied their claim on May 27,
    2004 on two grounds.  The first ground
    was that the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> voided the policy by failing to
    notify the insurer of a material change in the risk, namely a change in the
    heating system of the premises.  The
    second ground was that the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> had made wilfully
    false statements with respect to their contents claim and their claim for
    alternate living expenses, thus vitiating their right to recover.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 21, 2004, the Bank of Montreal submitted a
    proof of loss seeking payment of the mortgage under the Standard Mortgage
    Clause of the policy in the amount of $99,293.09.  On October 7, 2004, Farmers’ Mutual, taking
    the position that interest, penalties and discharge fees were not covered by
    the policy, paid the Bank the principal balance only, of $97,143.97.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 1, 2005 the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> commenced an action against Farmers’ <span class=GramE>Mutual</span> seeking a
    declaration that the insurance policy was valid and binding.  That action is as yet to be tried.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Farmers’ Mutual commenced this action on December 18,
    2006, relying on its right of subrogation under the Standard of Mortgage Clause.  Farmers’ Mutual’s action is on the covenant
    in the mortgage. It claims from the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> the sum
    of $97,143.97 that it paid the Bank on the mortgage.  In their defence, the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> pleaded that the Standard Mortgage Clause “is only triggered by Farmers’ Mutual
    not being liable to the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> for the fire loss.”  The <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span>, counterclaimed
    for a declaration that the policy of insurance remained in full force and
    effect on the date of the loss, that Farmers’ Mutual was liable to them
    pursuant to that policy, and that Farmers’ Mutual was not entitled to recover
    from them any amount it paid to the Bank of Montreal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2007, Farmers’ Mutual brought a motion for
    summary judgment in its action against the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span>.  In response, the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> brought a motion for the consolidation of the two actions.  Before the motion judge, the <span
class=SpellE>Pinders</span> argued that whether the policy is void or not, and
    whether they have an available remedy of relief from forfeiture were genuine
    issues for trial.  Those questions, the
    motion judge said, are the exact issues to be determined in the <span
class=SpellE>Pinders</span>’ action against Farmers’ Mutual.  In her view, Farmers’ Mutual’s summary
    judgment motion in this action was based only on the mortgage with the Bank,
    the payout to the Bank, and the Standard Mortgage Clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge relied upon <i>CIBC Mortgage Corporation v. Harding</i> [1993] O.J. No. 603 (General
    Division)<i> </i>and <i>7895 <span class=SpellE>Transmere</span> Drive Management Inc. v.
    Helter Investments Ltd.</i> [2005] O.J. No. 2847 (S.C.J.) for the proposition
    that “even when the defendant in a mortgage action asserts a claim that the Plaintiff
    has breached its duty of care (for which there is a genuine issue for trial),
    if the Standard Mortgage Clause is applicable, there is no defence in respect
    of the monies owing under the mortgage and summary judgment is granted
    accordingly.”  She added it was well
    established that the Standard Mortgage Clause in an insurance policy creates an
    independent contract between the insurer and the mortgagee, such that a
    mortgagee’s interest is not invalidated by any act or neglect by the insured
    mortgagor.”  She also stated that <i>Halifax Insurance Company v. <span
class=SpellE>Killick</span> </i>[2000] N.S.J. No. 272 (N.S.S.C.) “clearly
    establishes that an insurer is entitled to judgment against an insured for the
    monies paid to a mortgagee pursuant to a Standard Mortgage Clause, even if the
    insured’s claim was denied on the basis of a material change in risk.  When the insurer has paid the mortgagee it is
    entitled to judgment against the insured for the amount paid to the mortgagee.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the motion judge granted summary judgment
    against the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> in the amount of $97,143.97 plus
    prejudgment interest.  As the <span
class=SpellE>Pinders</span>’ counterclaim mirrored the claim in their action
    against Farmers’ Mutual, she stayed their counterclaim in this action, thus
    declining to order that the two actions be consolidated or heard together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> appeal seeking an
    order dismissing Farmers’ Mutual’s motion for summary judgment and an order
    directing that the two actions be tried together.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred by
    finding there were no genuine issues for trial and granting the insurer summary
    judgment based on its claimed right of subrogation under the Standard Mortgage
    Clause.  In particular, is the payment by
    the insurer to the mortgagee of any part of the loss award under the insurance
    policy the sole precondition for the insurer to claim a right of subrogation
    under the Standard Mortgage Clause?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>None
    of the cases relied on by the motion judge are helpful in deciding when an
    insurer can exercise its right of subrogation under the Standard Mortgage
    Clause without establishing that the policy is void as far as the insured is
    concerned.  The cases </span><i>CIBC Mortgage Corporation </i>and <i>7895 <span class=SpellE>Transmere</span> Drive</i> do not involve the subrogated rights of an insurer under the Standard Mortgage
    Clause at all.  <i>Halifax Insurance Company</i> did involve the insurer’s right of
    subrogation but did not deal with the situation in this case.  In <i>Halifax
    Insurance Company</i>, the insurer paid the mortgagee and then obtained
    judgment against the insured by exercising its subrogated right.  However, it had established at trial that the
    insurance policy had been voided by a material change in risk.  The court in <i>Halifax Insurance Company</i> did not consider the appellant’s position
    in this case, that is, that the insurer cannot exercise its subrogated rights without
    first establishing that the policy has been voided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the insurer’s right to subrogate arises, of
    course, depends on the language of the Standard Mortgage Clause.  <span lang=EN-US>Before turning to a close reading of that language, </span>it is useful
    to begin with a general survey of the function and effect of the Clause within
    the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Standard Mortgage Clause </span>has been a standard part of insurance policies
    for well over a century.  In <i>Guerin v. Manchester</i>, (1898), 29 S.C.R.
    139, the Supreme Court of Canada observed that the Clause “appears … to have
    been introduced into policies of insurance in the United States of America by
    the Mutual Insurance Company of New York, in the year 1860”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Caisse</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>populaire</span> des <span class=SpellE>deux</span> rives v. <span
class=SpellE>Société</span> <span class=SpellE>mutuelle</span> <span
class=SpellE>d’assurance</span> <span class=SpellE>contre</span> <span
class=SpellE>l’incendie</span> de la <span class=SpellE>vallée</span> du <span
class=SpellE>richelieu</span>, </i>[1990] 2 S.C.R. 995, <span class=SpellE>L’Heureux-Dubé</span> J., writing for the unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, found the Standard
    Mortgage Clause, though part of the policy between the insurer and insured,
    constitutes a second and separate insurance contract between the insured and
    the mortgagee. It is worth noting that she reached this conclusion because it
    “is consistent with the general scheme of insurance law as it is practised in
    North America, as well as being in keeping with the rules of Quebec civil law
    as a whole”: at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 18. She stressed that “the
    development of insurance law must necessarily take place within its own
    particular socio-economic context, namely North American insurance practice”:
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 17.  Later in these reasons, I will review American insurance law as it bears
    on the situation in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two contract theory, firmly embedded in North
    American insurance practice, <span lang=EN-US>protects
    the mortgagee’s interest in the insured property even when the insured has done
    something to void the policy.  The separate
    contract between the insurer and the mortgagee remains in force even when the
    policy itself has been voided by an </span>act, neglect, omission or
    misrepresentation attributable to the mortgagor, owner or occupant of the
    property.  Thus, when the insured mortgagor
    voids the policy, for example, by doing something that materially changes the
    risk, the Standard Mortgage Clause protects the mortgagee by maintaining the
    insurance of the mortgagee’s interest in force.  The insurer must pay the mortgagee’s loss to the extent of the policy
    limits even when the mortgagor insured has voided the policy.</p>

    risk.  This part of the Clause is not at
    issue in this case.  In fact this part of
    the Clause has been given effect – the insurer has paid the mortgagee the
    principal balance owing on the mortgage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case turns on the meaning of the second
    part of the Clause.  The second part of
    the Clause provides that when its requirements are met, the insurer becomes
    legally subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee against the insured to
    the extent of the payment it has made to the mortgagee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the insurer’s </span>payment of the mortgage debt to the mortgagee is the only
    precondition for the insurer’s right of subrogation.  He submits that as soon as the insurer pays
    the mortgagee, it is subrogated to the mortgagee’s rights under the mortgage to
    the extent of the payment.  Nothing else
    is required.  According to him, the
    insurer’s right of subrogation is unaffected by the phrase “<span lang=EN-US>and claims that – as to the Mortgagor or Owner
    – no liability <span class=SpellE>therefor</span> existed”.  In fact, he asserts this phrase could be
    removed without affecting the insurer’s right of subrogation. The clause should
    be read, he says, to provide “Whenever the Insurer pays the Mortgagee, any loss
    award under this policy, it shall be legally subrogated to all rights of the
    Mortgagee against the Insured”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    phrase </span>“<span lang=EN-US>and claims that
    – as to the Mortgagor or Owner – no liability <span class=SpellE>therefor</span> existed” is part of the Clause and must be given meaning.  Counsel for the insurer suggests that the
    phrase is included to give the insurer a right of subrogation in circumstances
    where it is liable to the mortgagee quite apart from the Standard Mortgage
    Clause.  He frankly concedes, however, that
    he cannot give an example of how such a situation would arise.  Yet, he submits, this interpretation is
    necessary to avoid a windfall to the insured where the insurer pays the balance
    of the mortgage to the mortgagee and pays the insured the loss under the policy
    as well. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The construction
    the insurer advocates is plainly inconsistent with the language of the Clause.   The language
    of the </span>Clause clearly stipulates two preconditions, not one, to the
    insurer’s right of subrogation.  The
    first precondition is that the insurer pays the mortgagee a portion of the loss
    award under the policy.  The second
    precondition, following the word “and”, is that the insurer claims <span
lang=EN-US>that it is not liable to the
    mortgagor or owner for the portion of the loss award it has paid to the mortgagee.  The grammatical structure of the Clause
    excludes interpreting the two phrases as addressing different situations, as
    the insurer submits.  Rather, the two
    phrases together define what gives rise to the insurer’s right of
    subrogation.  The interpretation the
    insurer puts forward is not only incompatible with the language of the Clause,
    but also, as I discuss later in these reasons, is inconsistent with how that
    language has been applied in the North American insurance industry for decades.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn next to a closer examination of the two
    preconditions. The first precondition is straightforward.  The insurer must pay the loss award, or a
    portion of it, to the mortgagee<span lang=EN-US>.  Rarely will there be a dispute as to whether
    the insurer has paid any of the loss <span class=GramE>award</span> to the
    mortgagee.  It is worth noting, however,
    that the payment the insurer makes to the mortgagee for the purposes of this
    Clause is the “loss award under this policy”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    contrast, the meaning of the second precondition requires closer scrutiny.  Read literally, the second precondition could
    mean that, having made a payment to the mortgagee, the insurer’s right of
    subrogation would be triggered by the mere articulation of a claim that it is
    had no liability to the mortgagor or owner for the loss award und</span><span
class=SpellE>er</span> the policy.  Such
    a meaning would seem inconsistent with the insurance policy considered as a
    whole within its commercial context.  The
    insured has paid premiums to the insurer for an insurance policy that includes
    the Standard Mortgage Clause.  The
    Standard Mortgage Clause is for the benefit of the insured as well as the
    mortgagee.  The payment the insurer makes
    to the mortgagee under the Clause is a part of the “loss award under this
    policy”.  Thus, as long as the policy
    remains in force, the insurer’s payment to the mortgagee would be a fulfillment
    of its obligations to the insured just as much as to the mortgagee.  It is unreasonable and contrary to ordinary commercial
    sense that one party to a contract should be able to negate the bargain made by
    the other party by articulating nothing more than a bare claim that the insured
    has voided the contract.  It seems to me
    this is one of those situations <span class=SpellE>Estey</span> J. had in mind
    when he said in <i>Consolidated Bathurst
    Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery Insurance Co.</i><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>[1980] 1 S.C.R. 888, that there were
    circumstances in which </span>it was inappropriate to apply the literal meaning
    of an insurance contract.  His statement
    is <span lang=EN-US>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    26:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Even apart from the doctrine of
    contra <span class=SpellE>proferentem</span> as it may be applied in the
    construction of contracts, the normal rules of construction lead a court to
    search for an interpretation which, from the whole of the contract, would
    appear to promote or advance the true intent of the parties at the time of
    entry into the contract. <u>Consequently, literal meaning should not be applied
    where to do so would bring about an unrealistic result or a result which would
    not be contemplated in the commercial atmosphere in which the insurance was
    contracted.</u> Where words may bear two constructions, the more reasonable
    one, that which produces a fair result, must certainly be taken as the
    interpretation which would promote the intention of the parties. <u>Similarly,
    an interpretation which defeats the intentions of the parties and their
    objective in entering into the commercial transaction in the first place should
    be discarded in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of an interpretation of the
    policy which promotes a sensible commercial result.</u> It is trite to observe
    that an interpretation of an ambiguous contractual provision which would render
    the <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> on the part of the insured to obtain
    insurance protection <span class=GramE>nugatory,</span> should be avoided. Said
    another way, the courts should be loath to support a construction which would
    either enable the insurer to pocket the premium without risk or the insured to
    achieve a recovery which could neither be sensibly sought nor anticipated at
    the time of the contract. [Emphasis added].</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering the commercial atmosphere in which
    insurance is contracted, and avoiding a construction which would render
    nugatory the insurance coverage the insured mortgagor has purchased to cover

    require that the insurer establish a claim that the insured mortgagor has
    voided the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was the view taken by this court more than a

    that case provided:</p>

    J.A. said at p. 423-424:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…the right, therefore, of the

    upon whether they had or had not a good <span class=SpellE>defence</span> against the mortgagor, the person in whose name the insurance was <span
class=GramE>effected</span>. If they had a good <span class=SpellE>defence</span>,
    the money paid to the mortgagees would be so paid by reason of the agreement
    and that alone, if they had not, the money paid would necessarily go in
    discharge of the mortgage, as the policy was <span class=GramE>effected</span> for the mortgagors benefit and at his expense.</span></p>

    decades.  As noted above, <span
class=SpellE>l’Heureux-Dubé</span> J. in <span class=SpellE><i>Caisse</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>populaire</span> des <span class=SpellE>deux</span> rives </i>highlighted the importance of choosing an interpretation of the
    Standard Mortgage Clause that is consistent with the general scheme of
    insurance law as it is practised in North America.  The Supreme Court also extensively considered
    American insurance jurisprudence in <i>National Bank of Greece (Canada) v. <span
class=SpellE>Katsikonouris</span> </i>[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1029.  In fact, La

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It is true that the clause under consideration here differs somewhat from that

    such as that of the Standard Mortgage Clause. A useful place to begin that
    examination is <i>Couch on Insurance 3d,</i> <span class=SpellE>looseleaf</span> (St. Paul, Minn.: Thomson West, 1995)

    subrogation to the rights of the mortgagee, upon payment to the latter of the

    recent synopsis of this longstanding legal principle: Daniel W. Gerber and <span
class=SpellE>Nikia</span> A. O’Neal, “Mortgage Clause Claims in the Subprime
    Fallout” 75 Def. Counsel J. 254 2008.  The
    authors’ discussion of the subrogation provision of the New York standard
    mortgage clause does not differ from the one before us in any material way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Importantly, an insurer is not
    entitled to subrogation or an assignment of the mortgagee’s rights, unless the
    insurer establishes that it has no liability to the named insured mortgagor due
    to the mortgagor’s breach of the insurance contract.  This is the rule because so long as the
    insurer has an obligation to the mortgagor, as well as the mortgagee, the
    mortgagor has the right to have the insurer’s payment to the mortgagee applied
    to reduce the amount of its mortgage debt.  And, the insurer cannot extinguish the mortgagor’s right to have
    insurance monies reduce its debt by assuming the rights of the mortgagee and
    initiating a foreclosure action against the mortgagor to recoup amounts paid to
    the mortgagee. But, where an insurer is liable to a mortgagee, but is not
    liable to a named insured mortgagor due to the mortgagor’s breach of the
    insurance contract, the mortgagor is not entitled to have the insurance
    proceeds applied to reduce the mortgage debt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This reasoning leaves no room for the complaint,
    advanced strenuously by the insurer in this case, that it is suffering
    financial unfairness because the insured mortgagor has not been making any
    payments on the mortgage.  The insurer
    cannot show this complaint has any merit without establishing that the insurance
    policy is void as against the insured.  Otherwise,
    the insurer’s payment to the mortgagee has discharged the principal owing on
    the mortgage leaving no ongoing payments to be made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The American jurisprudence and commentary reinforces my
    conclusion that there are two preconditions to the insurer’s entitlement to
    subrogation under the Standard Mortgage Clause.  First, the insurer must make payment of the loss award, or part of it,
    to the mortgagee.  Second, the insurer
    must establish a claim that it has no liability to the mortgagor insured.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the existence of the second precondition

    claim “on the basis that their failure to report a material change in risk
    voided the contract, and alternatively that they had made wilful false
    statements with respect to their contents claim, issued in their right to
    recover under the policy.”  In their
    statement of defence the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> plead that the insurer’s
    right under the Standard Mortgage Clause “is only triggered by Farmers’ Mutual
    not being liable to the <span class=SpellE>Pinders</span> for the fire loss.”  They also plead that they have not breached
    the insurance contract, the insurance policy remains in full force and effect,
    and Farmers’ Mutual remains liable to them for payment of the fire loss.  The issue raised and joined in the pleadings
    is a genuine issue for trial.  The motion

    Ins. Co</i>.: see e.g.,<i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'> </span>Nagel-Taylor Automotive Supplies, Inc. v.
    Aetna Casualty &amp;Surety Company of Illinois</i>, 103 Ill. App. 3d 100.  Further, the facts in <span
class=SpellE><i>Kerber</i></span> are
    distinguishable from the case at bar – there, while the insurers and the
    mortgagor were litigating as to whether the policy had been voided by the
    mortgagor’s conduct, in a separate action, the insurance companies were made
    defendants in foreclosure proceedings initiated by a secured creditor. The <span
class=SpellE><i>Kerber</i></span> decision
    also relied on the fact that the insurance companies depended on the right of
    subrogation to properly defend themselves in the foreclosure proceedings. </p>
