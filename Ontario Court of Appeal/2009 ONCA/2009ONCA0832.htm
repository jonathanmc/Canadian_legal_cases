  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span lang=FR-CA>I. Introduction</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is yet another case raising issues about the
    proper interpretation of the<i> Road Access
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.34. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Except in limited circumstances, the Act prohibits a landowner
    from blocking a private road without a court order if doing so will prevent all
    road access to another property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as a balance to this restriction on a
    landowner’s rights, s. 3(1) of the Act provides that a judge may grant an order
    closing a private road if satisfied that: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>a) a closing
    order is “reasonably necessary to prevent substantial damage or injury to the
    interests of the [landowner]”; or </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>b) the owners
    or occupants of lands served by the road “do not have a legal right to use
    [it].”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, Brennan J. dismissed Mr. Limlaw’s
    application for an injunction restraining Mr. and Mrs. Ryan from keeping a
    locked gate at the entrance to a private road on their property (the “disputed
    road”) because he found that Mr. Limlaw has alternate road access via a trail
    on neighbouring Crown land.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, despite his opinion that the Ryans could
    prevent Mr. Limlaw from using the disputed road without a court order, the
    application judge granted the Ryans’ cross-application for a road closing
    order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the past, the Ryans have given some of their other
    neighbours, whose properties are otherwise landlocked, a key to the gate in
    exchange for a small annual fee. After holding that the conditions in s. 3 are
    disjunctive, the application judge granted a road closing order under s.
    3(1)(b) based on a finding that the landlocked neighbours do not have a legal
    right to use the disputed road. However, he imposed a condition requiring the
    Ryans to continue to allow their landlocked neighbours to use it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Mr. Limlaw submits that the application
    judge made the following errors:  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>finding that the hiking trail on neighbouring Crown
    land provides alternate road access to Mr. Limlaw's property; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>interpreting the conditions in s. 3(1) of the Act that
    trigger the court’s jurisdiction to make a road closing order disjunctively;
    and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>imposing a condition that the disputed road remain open
    to some neighbours but  not to others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On their cross-appeal, the Ryans ask that the condition
    in the road closing order be amended so that they are permitted, but not required,
    to allow their landlocked neighbours to continue to use the disputed road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal
    and cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II.<i> </i>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            1. The parties, their
    properties and the disputed road</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ryans are the owners of about 75 acres of land in Renfrew
    County; Hudson and Doris Elmore own the property immediately to the west of the
    Ryans’ land; Mr. Limlaw owns approximately 200 acres of land west of the Elmores’
    property; and Francis Maloney has a cottage on Crown land southwest of Mr.
    Limlaw’s land.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A public road runs across the Ryans’ land. This road
    enters their property near the middle of its southern boundary, proceeds
    north-easterly to the eastern boundary, and from there continues easterly across
    adjoining lands. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The entrance to the disputed road is near the mid-point
    of the public road as it crosses the Ryans’ land. From there, the disputed road
    runs westerly to the eastern boundary of the Elmores’ land, continues westerly
    across the Elmores’ land, south-westerly across Mr. Limlaw's land and eventually
    reaches Mr. Maloney’s cottage property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ryan family has owned their land and other
    properties in the vicinity for more than 100 years.  During this period, family members have used
    their land primarily for hunting and logging and have also permitted several
    neighbouring landowners to use the disputed road to access their cottage and
    hunt camp properties. These parties historically made a small annual payment to
    the Ryan family for their use of the disputed road. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since 1953, there has been a “No Trespassing” sign at
    the entrance to the disputed road. In 1982, the Ryans and one of the other users
    of the disputed road put a locked gate across the entrance to the road to
    exclude trespassers. Recently, only the Ryan, Elmore and Maloney families have
    had keys to the gate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Limlaw purchased his property from Ambrose Hass in
    October 2005. The agreement of purchase and sale included an acknowledgment
    that access to the property was “by private road under the <i>Road Access Act</i>”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Purchasers acknowledge and accept that access
    to the property is by way of a private road under the Road Access Act and that
    a deeded right of way will not be provided on closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On closing, Mr. Hass provided a declaration of possession
    confirming that he did not have access to the disputed road:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The access road serving my property has been gated
    and locked throughout the period of my ownership. I have not had access to the
    property during the period of my ownership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hass's predecessor in title was his brother, Rev.
    Michael Hass, who acquired two lots in 1946 and 1947 before transferring both to
    Ambrose Hass in 1992. Although Mr. Limlaw said he believed that Rev. Hass used
    the disputed road on occasion, there was no admissible evidence on the
    application to that effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After purchasing his property, Mr. Limlaw approached
    the Ryans and asked for permission to use the disputed road. The Ryans refused Mr.
    Limlaw’s request. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            2. Relevant Statutory
    Provisions</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, except in limited circumstances, the
    Act prohibits a landowner from blocking a private road without a court order if
    doing so will prevent all road access to other parcels of land. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 2(1)(a) and 3(1) are central to the issues on
    appeal. Section 2(1)(a) sets out the prohibition against closing a private road
    without a court order; s. 3(1) describes the circumstances in which a road closing
    order can be made. In addition to these provisions, I will set out some
    definitions and ancillary provisions that are relevant for the purpose of this
    appeal. The full text of the Act is set out in Appendix ‘A’.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2(1)(a) provides that “no person shall
    construct, place or maintain ... a barrier ... over an access road, not being a
    common road ... that, as a result, prevents all road access to one or more
    parcels of land” unless the person has obtained a court order:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. (1)   <i>No person shall</i> construct, place or <i>maintain a barrier</i> or other obstacle <i>over an access road</i>, not being a common
    road, <i>that, as a result, prevents all
    road access to one or more parcels of land</i> or to boat docking facilities
    therefore, not owned by that person <i>unless</i>,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <i>the
    person has made application to a judge for an order closing the road</i> and
    has given 90 days notice of such application to the parties and in the manner
    directed by this Act <i>and the judge has
    granted the application</i> to close the road...<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The terms
    “access road” and “common road” are important because they draw a distinction
    between a road that is purely private and a road on private land on which
    public monies have been spent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1 states that an “access road” is “a road
    located on land not owned by a municipality and not dedicated and accepted as,
    or otherwise deemed at law to be, a public highway, that serves as a motor
    vehicle access route to one or more parcels of land.” A “common road” is “an
    access road on which public money has been expended for its repair or
    maintenance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Road” is defined as meaning “land used or intended for
    use for the passage of motor vehicles.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Motor vehicle means “a motor vehicle as defined in the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>” and therefore
    includes, subject to certain exceptions, “any... vehicle propelled or driven
    otherwise than by muscular power.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1) describes the circumstances in which a
    road closing order can be made for access roads and common roads. Subsection
    3(1)(a) sets out a condition that is common to both types of road. Subsections
    3(1)(b) and (c) describe an additional condition relating to access roads and
    common roads respectively: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>3. (1) <i>The judge may grant the closing order upon
    being satisfied</i> that,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(a) <i>the closure of the road is reasonably
    necessary to prevent substantial damage or injury to the interests of the
    applicant</i> or for some other purpose in the public interest;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(b) <i>in the case of an access road that is not a
    common road, persons described in subsection 2(3) do not have the legal right

    Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2006, Mr. Limlaw issued an application
    requesting an interlocutory and permanent injunction enjoining the Ryans “from
    constructing, placing or maintaining a barrier or other obstacle” over the disputed
    road. In support of his application, he claimed that the disputed road is an
    “access road” within the meaning of s. 1 of the Act and that it provides the
    only vehicular access to his and neighbouring lands. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his material, Mr. Limlaw stated that he may, in the
    future, build a cottage on his property. However, his primary goal is to
    harvest timber. In that regard, he claims that the Ryans’ conduct is preventing
    him from using his land for its intended purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            4. The Ryans’ Cross-application
    for an Order Closing the Disputed Road</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 9, 2007, the Ryans issued a cross-application
    requesting an order closing the disputed road or, in the alternative, an
    interlocutory or permanent injunction enjoining Mr. Limlaw from using the disputed
    road to transport logs or for any other commercial purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Ryan deposed in an affidavit that, as far as he was
    aware, Mr. Limlaw's predecessors in title had never used the disputed road to
    access their property. Further, he expressed the view that it is possible to access
    Mr. Limlaw's property via the hiking trail on neighbouring Crown lands with a
    4x4 half ton truck, a midsized 4x4 truck, a sport-utility vehicle or a 4x4 Jeep,
    and referred to a statement from Mr. Elmore confirming that he had used the
    hiking trail to access the Elmore land over the course of 20 years using a 1970
    Jeepster Commando. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a subsequent affidavit, Mr. Ryan said he believes
    that Mr. Limlaw's proposed use of the disputed road would cause “significant
    rutting” and the “possible collapse” of the road. When asked on
    cross-examination if his interest in preventing Mr. Limlaw from accessing the disputed
    road was based on Mr. Limlaw’s intention to log the property, he responded,
    “Commercial entrance, it means more than logging when you're looking for a
    commercial entrance.” Mr. Ryan also disputed the suggestion that he would have
    no problem letting Mr. Elmore use the disputed road if Mr. Elmore wished to log
    his land. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Limlaw disputed the Ryans’ claims that the hiking
    trail on Crown land is accessible by vehicles wider and less rugged than an
    ATV. He also provided affidavit evidence indicating that the cost to repair any
    potential damage to the disputed road would not be substantial and, in any
    event, deposed that he understood and would satisfy his common law obligations
    to indemnify the Ryans for any damage he caused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When cross-examined prior to the application hearing,
    Mr. Ryan acknowledged “an underlying dispute” with Mr. Limlaw. According to Mr.
    Limlaw, this evidence reveals an ulterior motive for the Ryans’ refusal to
    allow him to have access to the disputed road. Mr. Ryan also acknowledged that
    he had provided assurances to the Elmores and Mr. Maloney that, whatever the
    outcome of the applications, he does not intend to prevent them from gaining
    access to their lands via the disputed road at this time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            5. Mr. Limlaw’s
    Interim Motion for an Injunction</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a ruling refusing Mr. Limlaw’s request for an
    interim injunction, the application judge concluded that the disputed road is
    an access road within the meaning of s. 1 of the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am bound by the Court of Appeal decision in <i>992275 Ontario Inc. v. Krawczyk</i>, [2006]
    O.J. No. 1730, and on that authority and the respondents’ admission that the
    Ryan lands is used for road access to the Elmore and Maloney lands, I am
    compelled to find the roadway across the Ryan land is an access road as defined
    in the <i>Road Access Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge later confirmed this ruling in
    his reasons disposing of the application and cross-application. On appeal, the
    Ryans concede that the disputed road is an access road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            6. The Application
    Judge’s Reasons on the Application and Cross-Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge dismissed Mr. Limlaw's request
    for an injunction restraining the Ryans from maintaining a barrier over the disputed
    road because he found that Mr. Limlaw has alternate motor vehicle access to his
    property via a “trail” on neighbouring Crown land. In doing so, the application
    judge rejected Mr. Limlaw's evidence that the trail was inaccessible by
    anything other than an all terrain vehicle, and accepted the Ryans’ evidence
    that, in addition to all terrain vehicles, the trail can be used by four-wheel
    drive vehicles, such as 4 x 4’s and four-wheel-drive pickup trucks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also referred to the fact that
    “in Renfrew County many residents use ‘four-by-fours’ and 4-wheel-drive pickup
    trucks as their daily transport.” In addition, he observed that access via all
    terrain vehicles would not meet the test of alternate motor vehicle access as
    set out in this court’s decision in <i>Blais
    v.</i> <i>Belanger</i> (2007), 282 D.L.R.
    (4th) 98. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the application judge said he was basing
    his decision on his “finding that 4-wheel drive trucks and ‘4 by 4s’ can use
    the alternative road, although with difficulty.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On balance, after reviewing the affidavits and
    cross-examinations, and bearing in mind that the onus lies with Mr. Limlaw on
    this issue, I hold that the trail over the Crown lands provides alternative
    motor vehicle access to the Limlaw lands.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In light of that finding the Ryans are at liberty
    to exclude Mr. Limlaw from using the Ryan Road, and no order closing the road
    is required for that purpose. However that order is requested by the Ryans and
    I have concluded that they are entitled to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After finding that Mr. Limlaw has alternate motor
    vehicle access to his land and that the Ryans did not require a court order to
    exclude him from using the disputed road, the application judge went on to
    address the Ryans’ road closing application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected Mr. Limlaw's submission
    that the conditions in s. 3(1) must be read conjunctively so that a person
    requesting a road closing order must satisfy either the conditions set out in
    ss. 3(1)(a) and (b) or the conditions set out in ss. 3(1)(a) and (c) depending
    on whether the access road is a common road. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead he found that the conditions in s. 3(1) are to
    be read disjunctively. In addition, the application judge concluded that the
    persons with an interest in the lands served by the disputed road, namely the
    Elmore and Maloney families, are using the road with permission and have no
    legal right to use it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>1.         Did
    the application judge err by finding that the hiking trail on neighbouring
    Crown land provides alternate road access to Mr. Limlaw’s property?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Limlaw submits that the application judge erred in
    taking judicial notice of the type of vehicles that residents of Renfrew County
    drive. He further submits that the application judge erred in concluding that
    this court’s decision in <i>Blais </i>permits
    a finding that access via 4-wheel drive trucks and “4 x 4s” constitutes
    alternate road access.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept these submissions. The application
    judge's conclusion that Mr. Limlaw has alternate road access was premised on
    his factual finding that Mr. Limlaw can access his property via the trail over
    Crown lands using all-terrain vehicles, 4-wheel drive trucks and “4 x4’s”.
    There was evidence capable of supporting this finding of fact and I see no
    basis to interfere with it. Although I agree that the application judge should
    not have referred to the type of vehicles that Renfrew County residents drive
    without evidence on the point, I do not read this reference as being central to
    his reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I do not read<i> Blais </i>as precluding the application judge's conclusion that such
    access constitutes alternate road access. The issue in <i>Blais </i>was whether an access road that was used in the past
    continued to exist. The respondents, who were the persons wishing to use the
    access road, purchased their property in 2001. Although their predecessor in
    title gave evidence that he drove to the property over the access road using a
    four-wheel drive vehicle between 1992 and 2001, he also testified that the bush
    grew up unless it is was kept back. After the respondents purchased their
    property, they took steps improperly to widen and clear the area on the
    appellant’s land that, at least formerly, had been used as a road. This court
    said at paras. 37-38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Bishop's testimony, when combined with that of
    Mr. Chevrier who testified the bush grows up unless it is kept back and that of
    the respondents that they used buzz saws and chainsaws to clear the overgrowth,
    called for consideration of whether the road that had been there at one time
    continued to exist contemporarily.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Chevrier and the respondents’ testimony that
    they used small 4x4 vehicles to reach their land, and Mr. Bishop's testimony of
    how the route was occasionally used by persons in ATVs, provided only weak evidence
    of the contemporary existence of an access road. Such vehicles are by their
    nature capable of off-road travel. Landlocked owners cannot by acts of
    trespass, bring into being an access road across the land of another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considered in context, I do not understand<i> Blais </i>as meaning that a route cannot be
    an access road if it can only accommodate four-wheel drive vehicles. Rather,
    this court remitted the matter for reconsideration in light of three legal
    factors: i) those who use an access road on the land of another do not have the
    right to repair or maintain it; ii) a landowner does not have any obligation to
    maintain an access road that runs across his or her property; and iii) an
    access road may, through deterioration, cease to be a road over time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the application judge considered and
    rejected Mr. Limlaw's evidence that the trail could only be used on foot or using
    all-terrain vehicles and accepted the Ryans’ evidence that the trail has long
    been used by four-wheel drive vehicles. Further, although he recognized that
    access via the hiking trail would not provide Mr. Limlaw with the type of
    access he wanted for logging vehicles, and that the access provided could be
    difficult, the application judge concluded that “the trail over the Crown lands
    provides alternative motor vehicle access to the Limlaw lands.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no basis for interfering with this conclusion. The
    application judge’s finding that the neighbouring hiking trail is accessible
    using four-wheel drive vehicles was available on the evidence and Mr. Limlaw
    has not demonstrated that this conclusion reflects palpable and overriding
    error or that it is unreasonable. Further, in my view, the application judge’s
    conclusion is entirely in keeping with the purposes of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has emphasized on several occasions that a
    primary purpose of the Act is to prevent landowners from resorting to self-help
    and to provide a judicially supervised dispute resolution process: see, for
    example, <i>2008795 Ontario Inc. v. Kilpatrick</i> (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 11, citing <i>Blais</i>, at para. 43. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this court has said repeatedly that the
    rights provided by the Act are extremely limited. The Act does not confer any
    rights on the owner or occupant of lands served by the road other than the limited
    right not to be treated as a trespasser when using the road in a motor vehicle
    to access their property:<i> </i>see, for
    example, <i>Whitmell v. Ritchie</i> (1994), 20
    O.R. (3d) 424; <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Kilpatrick</span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>, at paras. 20-22</span>; <i>Blais</i>, at paras. 28-29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, in my opinion, the Act was not designed to
    ensure that landlocked property owners are able to enjoy all the potential uses
    of their otherwise landlocked property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Limlaw has not identified a basis for
    interfering with the application judge’s finding, I would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><b>2.         Did the application judge err by
    interpreting the conditions in s. 3(1) of the Act that trigger the court’s
    jurisdiction to make a road closing order disjunctively?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><b>3.         Did the application judge err by imposing
    a condition that the disputed road remain open to some neighbours but not to
    others?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I consider it unnecessary to address the second and
    third issues raised by Mr. Limlaw for three reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in my opinion, once the application judge
    determined that Mr. Limlaw has alternate road access to his property, Mr.
    Limlaw had no standing to oppose the road closing application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, s. 2(3) describes who is entitled to
    notice of a road closing application. The relevant part of that section says
    the notice must be served on the owner or occupant of each parcel of land
    served by the road “who would, if the road were closed, be deprived of motor
    vehicle access to and from the owner’s land”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Notice of an application to close an access road</i> that is not a common
    road <i>shall be served</i> personally upon
    or sent by registered mail to <i>the owner
    of each parcel of land served by the road who would, if the road were closed,
    be deprived of motor vehicle access to and from the owner’s land</i> and, where
    the owner is not occupying the land, notice shall also be given to a tenant or
    occupant of the land ... [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain reading of s. 2(3), the only persons entitled
    to notice of a road closing application are those who do not have alternate
    road access to their property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the clear wording of s. 2(3), it is no doubt
    the common practice to serve all persons whose properties are served by a
    private road with notice of a road closing application whether those neighbours
    have alternate road access to their properties or not. Such an approach makes
    good common sense. If a landowner blocks a private road without first obtaining
    a declaration that a neighbour has alternate road access and it is later
    determined that the neighbour does not have alternate access, the landowner
    will have violated the prohibition in s. 2 of the Act and exposed themselves to
    prosecution under s. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the fact that prudent practice dictates
    serving persons who might be entitled to notice of a road closing application, does
    not give persons who are not actually entitled to notice standing to oppose the
    road closing application. Rather, where the issue of alternate road access is
    controversial, a preliminary determination should be made concerning whether
    the persons in question have alternate road access. If it is determined that they
    have alternate road access, their interest in the proceeding is at an end. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A less expedient method of proceeding illustrates this
    point. It would be open to a landowner to apply for a declaration concerning
    whether a particular neighbour is entitled to notice of a road closing
    application before proceeding with the application. If a finding is made that
    the neighbour has alternate road access, the neighbour is not entitled to
    notice of the road closing application or to standing at the hearing. The fact
    that a landowner chooses to proceed in a more expedient fashion should not
    change this result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second reason I consider it unnecessary to address
    Mr. Limlaw’s remaining grounds is that I agree with the application judge’s
    conclusion that the Ryans do not require a road closing order to prevent Mr.
    Limlaw from using the disputed road. If the Ryans can prevent Mr. Limlaw from
    using the disputed road without a court order, I fail to see why he should have
    a say in whether the Ryans are entitled to a road closing order under s. 3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain reading of s. 2 of the Act, so long as a
    landowner gives landlocked neighbours access to a private road, the landowner
    does not require a road closing order to prevent a neighbour who has alternate
    road access from using the private road. <a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although s. 3(1) sets out the conditions for obtaining
    a road closing order, it is s. 2(1) that prohibits blocking a private road. The
    prohibition is against “construct[ing], plac[ing] or maintain[ing] a barrier or
    other obstacle … <i>that, as a result,
    prevents all road access to one or more parcels of land</i>” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I see it, so long as a landowner permits their
    landlocked neighbours to access a private road, for example, by giving them a
    key to a locked gate, s. 2(1) does not prohibit the landowner from erecting a
    barrier that impedes a neighbour with alternate access.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Laskin J.A. reached a similar conclusion in <i>Kilpatrick</i>, <i>supra</i>. At para. 24 of <i>Kilpatrick</i>,
    he said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I said in the overview, the Act implicitly
    allows the owner of an access road to close it without a court order as long as
    doing so does not prevent &quot;all road access&quot; to another piece of
    property -- in short, as long as there is alternate road access to the other
    property. The trial judge correctly noted that those seeking to use the access
    road, here the cottagers, bear the onus of showing that no alternate road
    access exists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, provided the Ryans permit the Elmores and
    Mr. Maloney to use the disputed road, they are free to erect a barrier
    excluding Mr. Limlaw. In these circumstances, he has no interest in the
    question of whether a road closing order should be made as against neighbouring
    property owners whose properties would be landlocked by an order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, given that the Ryans can exclude him but not
    the landlocked neighbours<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> without a road closing order, Mr. Limlaw has no grounds for challenging an
    order that has that effect. If the Ryans can prevent him from using the road in
    any event, he has no basis for complaining about an order that has that effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I should not be taken as saying that the
    Ryans were entitled to maintain the status quo without obtaining a road closing
    order. I am also sceptical that the application judge’s order, closing the
    disputed road but requiring the Ryans to continue to allow the Elmores and Mr.
    Maloney to use it, is authorized under the Act. </p>

    disputed road, the Elmore and Maloney lands are otherwise landlocked. </span>Accordingly,
    t<span style='line-height:200%'>he Ryans were not
    entitled to maintain a locked gate across the disputed road and charge the
    Elmores and Mr. Maloney a fee for a key to the gate unless they obtained a road
    closing order or made an agreement in writing with the Elmores and Mr. Maloney
    permitting them to do so: s. 2(1)(a) and (b) of the Act.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Act does not define the term “closing
    order”, which is used in s. 3. Rather,  s.
    3(1)  sets  out  the
     conditions  that must  be  met
    before  a closing order can be made. However, it seems to me that
    the closing order referred to in s. 3 is probably an order that permits doing
    that which is prohibited in s. 2. Therefore, a closing order is probably an
    order that “permits constructing, placing or maintaining a barrier that
    prevents all road access to one or more parcels of land”.  On its face, the order made by the application
    judge does not satisfy this requirement. Therefore, I am sceptical that it is
    authorized by the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that Mr. Limlaw has any
    grounds for complaint. Once it was determined that he had alternate road access
    to his property, the Ryans were entitled to prevent him from using the disputed
    road without a court order so long as they allowed landlocked parties to have
    access. They did not lose the ability to exclude Mr. Limlaw just because they
    may have, for a time, been excluding or charging others improperly. Further, as
    I see it, the propriety of the application judge’s road closing order is a
    matter for the Elmores and Mr. Maloney to complain about, not Mr. Limlaw.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third reason I consider it unnecessary to address
    Mr. Limlaw’s remaining grounds is that whether the conditions in s. 3(1)(a) and
    (b) of the Act are read conjunctively or disjunctively, he has no grounds for
    opposing the road closing order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1)(a) provides that to grant a road closing
    order a judge must be satisfied that “the closure of the road is reasonably
    necessary to prevent substantial damage or injury to the interests of the
    [landowner]”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, because a road closing order granted under s.
    3 gives a landowner permission to landlock other properties, a landowner should
    not be able to obtain a road closing order based on potential damage or injury
    to his or her interests caused by a person with alternate road access. Such an interpretation
    of s. 3(1)(a) would be unfair to the neighbouring property owners who would become
    landlocked by the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking this case as an example, it would be unfair to
    allow the Ryans to obtain a road closing order because Mr. Limlaw’s use would
    cause substantial damage to the road. It is the Elmores and Mr. Maloney who will
    be landlocked by a road closing order, not Mr. Limlaw.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, even if the conditions for granting a road
    closing order under s. 3(1) are conjunctive, Mr. Limlaw’s proposed use of the
    road is irrelevant to the question of whether a road closing order should be
    made. His proposed use of the disputed road does not provide the Ryans with
    grounds for obtaining a road closing order; nor does it provide him with
    grounds for opposing such an order. If the neighbours who stand to become
    landlocked do not oppose a road closing order, Mr. Limlaw simply has no say in
    the matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, because Mr. Limlaw has alternate access to
    his property, he is no longer an interested party under s. 3(1)(b). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Section 3(1)(b) provides that to grant a road closing order a
    judge must be satisfied that “persons described in s. 2(3) do not have a legal
    right to use the road”.  As I have explained
    already, once it is determined Mr. Limlaw has alternate access, he is no longer
    entitled to be served with a road closing application under s. 2(3). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, on the facts of this case, Mr. Limlaw has
    no legal right to use the disputed road. He has no claim to such a right under
    the Act because he has alternate road access to his property. He does not have
    an easement, a right-of-way or any form of contractual right to use the disputed
    road. Finally, neither he nor his predecessors in title ever had the Ryans’ permission
    to use it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, whether s. 3 is interpreted conjunctively
    or disjunctively, Mr. Limlaw has nothing to add to the question of whether a
    road closing order should be made. The Ryans can prevent him from using the disputed
    road without a court order; his proposed use of the disputed road is irrelevant
    to the question of whether a road closing order should be granted and he has no
    basis for claiming a legal right to use the road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, Mr. Limlaw makes a strong argument that,
    despite the Legislature’s use of the word “or” in s. 3(1), the conditions in
    that section should be read conjunctively. Although it is unnecessary that I decide
    this question, because his argument may call into question this court’s interpretation
    of s. 3(1)(b), I will describe it briefly and set out my preliminary views. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Limlaw’s argument goes like this. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Act was originally passed in 1978, s. 3 read
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>When judge may grant
    order</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>3. The judge <i>may grant the closing order upon being
    satisfied that the closure of the road is reasonably necessary to prevent
    substantial damage or injury to the interests of the applicant or is reasonably
    necessary for some purpose in the public interest</i> and the judge may impose
    such terms and conditions as the judge considers are reasonable and just under
    the circumstances, including a requirement that a suitable alternate road be
    provided. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a 2001 amendment that became effective on
    January 1, 2003, s. 3(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>Conditions for
    closing order</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>3. (1) The judge <i>may grant the closing order</i> upon being
    satisfied that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>(a) the <i>closure of the road is reasonably necessary
    to prevent substantial damage or injury to the interests of the applicant or
    for some other purpose in the public interest</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>(b) in the case of
    an access road that is not a common road, <i>persons
    described in subsection 2 (3) do not have the legal right to use the road; or</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>(c) in the case of a
    common road, the persons who use the road do not have the legal right to do so.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A comparison of the original provision and the amended
    provision reveals that the legislature chose to retain the original condition
    for granting a road closing order, namely, that closure is reasonably necessary
    to prevent substantial damage or injury to the interests of the applicant or is
    reasonably necessary for some purpose in the public interest. The legislature also
    added a new condition, namely, that those persons who are entitled to be served
    with notice of a closing application do not have a legal right to use the road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly the legislature did not intend, by the 2001
    amendment, to eliminate the original condition it had prescribed for obtaining
    a road closing order. Nor, says Mr. Limlaw, did the legislature intend by the
    amendment to allow a private road owner to rescind an easement or right-of-way.
    However, according to Mr. Limlaw, one of those two results will be the effect
    if the conditions in s. 3(1) are interpreted disjunctively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Limlaw relies on two lines of authority in support
    of his position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he relies on <i>Rasmussen
    v. Ruzic</i> (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 756 (S.C.), in which O'Neill J. held that
    that a landowner cannot obtain an order closing a private road under s. 3(1)
    where a neighbour has an easement, right-of-way or other legal right to use the
    private road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rasmussen</i>,
    the Ruzics had a registered right-of-way allowing them to use the Rasmussens’
    private road. In dismissing the Rasmussens’ application for a road closing
    order, the application judge said the Rasmussens would not be entitled to such
    an order even if they could show that closing the road was reasonably necessary
    to prevent substantial damage or injury to their interests because they could
    not satisfy s. 3(1)(b). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge relied on section 6(1) of the Act
    to support his interpretation. Section 6(1) states, “Nothing in this Act shall
    be construed to confer any rights in respect of the ownership of land where the
    right does not otherwise exist at law”. In the application judge's view, using the
    Act to extinguish the Ruzics’ right-of-way and restore full fee simple
    ownership to the Rasmussens would run afoul of s. 6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he did not say so expressly, in effect, the
    application judge interpreted the conditions in s. 3(1) conjunctively. Mr.
    Limlaw submits that he was correct in doing so. On the facts of <i>Rasmussen</i>, interpreting the conditions
    in s. 3(1) disjunctively would have allowed a landowner to use the Act to
    rescind a right-of-way. Nothing in the legislative history of the Act suggests
    that was the legislature’s intent; s. 6(1) of the Act suggests the contrary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second line of authority on which Mr. Limlaw relies
    is this court's decisions in <i>Krawczyk</i> and <i>Kilpatrick</i>. Those decisions say
    that a neighbour cannot rely on rights under the Act to establish a legal right
    to use a private road within the meaning of s. 3(1)(b). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Mr. Limlaw, on a practical level it is
    difficult to see how s. 3(1)(a) could ever apply in light of <i>Krawczyk</i> and <i>Kilpatrick</i>. The only situation in which a private road owner will
    be unable to rely on s. 3(1)(b) to obtain a road closing order will be where
    their neighbours have a legal right to use the road that exists independently
    of the Act. However, because s. 6 of the Act does not permit a landowner to
    rescind an easement or right-of-way or other legal right to use a private road,
    s. 3(1)(a) will never apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, despite the legislature’s intention to
    preserve the original condition it had prescribed for obtaining a road closing
    order when it made the 2001 amendments, on the current state of the law,
    interpreting s. 3(1) disjunctively would do the opposite. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see at least two flaws in Mr. Limlaw’s argument.
    First, it ignores the presence of the word “or” between ss. 3(1)(b) and (c) and
    the plain meaning of s. 3(1), which is that the conditions should be read
    disjunctively. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it makes s. 3(1)(b) almost redundant. On Mr.
    Limlaw’s interpretation, s. 3(1)(b) does no more than reinforce what s. 6(1)
    already accomplishes; it means that a landowner cannot use the provisions of
    the Act to rescind an easement, right-of-way or other legal right to use a
    private road. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An alternate suggestion might be to interpret s.
    3(1)(b) as applying to trespassers, meaning people who have never had
    permission, whether express or implied, to use the private road under
    consideration. On that interpretation, rights under the Act would not be a
    factor in determining whether a neighbour was excluded under s. 3(1)(b) and neither
    s. 3(1)(a) nor s. 3(1)(b) would be redundant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using the facts of this case as an example, the Ryans
    could obtain a road closing order under s. 3(1)(b) if their neighbours fell
    into Mr. Limlaw’s category in the sense that they had never had the owner’s
    permission to use the private road. On the other hand, the Ryans would have to
    meet the criteria under s. 3(1)(a) in order to obtain a road closing order
    against neighbours like the Elmores and Mr. Maloney who have had permission in
    the past to use the disputed road. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, this interpretation may be inconsistent with <i>Krawczyk</i> and <i>Kilpatrick</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, for the reasons I have explained, it is
    unnecessary that these grounds of appeal be determined in this case.
    Accordingly, they remain open for determination in a proper future case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>IV. The Cross-Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of cross-appeal, the Ryans ask that the
    condition in the road closing order be amended so that they are permitted, but
    not required, to allow their landlocked neighbours to continue to use the disputed
    road. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The
    Ryans did not serve the Elmores or Mr. Maloney with notice of the cross-appeal.
    Although the Elmores and Mr. Maloney did not oppose the road closing order,
    they did not consent to it. Further, it appears that they may have relied on a
    representation made by the Ryans that they have no present intention of
    impeding their landlocked neighbours’ access to the disputed road. However, the
    amendment the Ryans seek would allow them to do just that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal. However, nothing in these reasons should be taken as confirming
    that the order made by the application judge is a proper order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>V. Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss the appeal and
    cross-appeal. I would award costs of the appeal to the Ryans on a partial indemnity
    scale in the amount of $10,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements and I would
    make no order as to costs of the cross-appeal. I would order costs of the
    proceeding below to the Ryans in the amount of $15,000 inclusive of GST and
    disbursements.</p>

    said, it is inadvisable for a landowner to erect a barrier that excludes a
    neighbour from a private road without first obtaining a declaration that the
    neighbour has alternate access if that issue is controversial. Otherwise, the
    landowner runs the risk of violating the prohibition in s. 2 and committing an
    offence under s. 7. </p>

    application judge found that, apart from the disputed road, the Elmore and
    Maloney properties are landlocked. On my review of the record and the
    application judge’s reasons, it may not be clear whether the hiking trail that provides access to the Limlaw lands also provides
    access to the Elmore and/or Maloney properties. However, no issue was raised on
    appeal concerning this finding.</p>
