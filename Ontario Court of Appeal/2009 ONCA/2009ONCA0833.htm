  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 14, 2009, the Nortel group of companies
    (referred to in these reasons as “Nortel”) applied for and was granted
    protection under the <i>Companies’ Creditors
    Arrangement Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985 c. C-36, <span class=GramE>(</span>“<i>CCAA</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to provide Nortel with breathing space to
    permit it to file a plan of compromise or arrangement with the court, that
    order provided, <i>inter alia</i>, a stay of
    all proceedings against Nortel, a suspension of all rights and remedies against
    Nortel, and an order that during the stay period, no person shall discontinue,
    repudiate, or cease to perform any contract or agreement with Nortel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CAW-Canada (“Union”) represents employees of Nortel
    at two sites in Ontario.  The Union and
    Nortel are parties to a collective agreement covering both sites.  On April 21, 2009, the Union and a group of former
    employees of Nortel (“Former Employees”) each brought a motion for directions
    seeking certain relief from the order granted to Nortel on January 14,
    2009.  On June 18, 2009, Morawetz J.
    denied both motions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Union and the Former Employees both appealed from
    that decision.  Their appeals were heard
    one after the other on October 1, 2009.  The appeal of the Former Employees was supported by a group of Canadian
    non-unionized employees, whose employment with Nortel continues.  Nortel was supported in opposing the appeals
    by the board of directors of two of the Nortel companies, an informal Nortel <span
class=SpellE>noteholders</span> group, and the Official Committee of Unsecured
    Creditors of Nortel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We will address each of the two appeals in turn.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE UNION APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collective agreement between the Union and Nortel
    sets out the terms and conditions of employment of the 45 employees that have continued
    to work for Nortel since January 14, 2009.  The collective agreement also obliges Nortel to make certain periodic
    payments to unionized former employees who have retired or been terminated from
    Nortel.  The three kinds of periodic
    payments at issue in this proceeding are monthly payments under the Retirement
    Allowance Plan (“RAP”), payments under the Voluntary Retirement Option (“VRO”),
    and termination and severance payments to unionized employees who have been
    terminated or who have severed their employment at Nortel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the January 14, 2009 order, Nortel has continued
    to pay the continuing employees their compensation and benefits as required by
    the collective agreement.  However, as of
    that date, it ceased to make the periodic payments at issue in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Union’s motion requested an order directing Nortel
    to resume those periodic payments as required by the collective agreement.  The Union’s argument hinges on s. 11.3(a) of
    the <i>CCAA</i>.  At the time this appeal was argued, it read as
    follows:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11.3 No order made under section 11 shall have the
    effect of</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>prohibiting</span> a person
    from requiring immediate payment for goods, services, use of leased or licensed
    property or other valuable consideration provided after the order is made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Union’s argument before the motion judge was that
    the collective agreement is a bargain between it and Nortel that ought not to
    be divided into separate obligations and therefore the “compensation” for
    services performed under it must include all of Nortel’s monetary obligations,
    not just those owed specifically to those who remain actively employed.  The Union argued that the contested periodic
    payments to Former Employees must be considered part of the compensation for
    services provided after January 14, 2009, and therefore exempted from the order
    of that date by s. 11.3(a) of the </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE><i>CCAA</i>.</span>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed this argument.  The essence of his reasons is as follows at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 67:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The flaw
    in the argument of the Union is that it equates the crystallization of a
    payment obligation under the Collective Agreement to a provision of a service
    within the meaning of s. 11.3.&nbsp; The triggering of the payment obligation
    may have arisen after the Initial Order but it does not follow that a service
    has been provided after the Initial Order.&nbsp; Section 11.3 contemplates, in
    my view, some current activity by a service provider post-filing that gives
    rise to a payment obligation post-filing.&nbsp; The distinction being that the
    claims of the Union for termination and severance pay are based, for the most
    part, on services that were provided pre-filing.&nbsp; Likewise, obligations
    for benefits arising from RAP and VRO are again based, for the most part, on
    services provided pre-filing.&nbsp; The exact time of when the payment
    obligation crystallized is not, in my view, the determining factor under
    section 11.3.&nbsp; Rather, the key factor is whether the employee performed
    services after the date of the Initial Order.&nbsp; If so, he or she is
    entitled to compensation benefits for such current service.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Union challenges this conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, neither the Union nor any other party
    argues that Nortel’s obligation to make the contested periodic payments should
    be decided by arbitration under the collective agreement rather than by the
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does the Union argue that any of the unionized former
    employees, who would receive these periodic payments, have themselves provided
    services to Nortel since the January 14, 2009 order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather, the Union reiterates the argument it made at
    first instance, namely that these periodic payments are protected by s. 11.3(a)
    of the <i>CCAA </i>as payment for service
    provided after the January 14, 2009 order was made by the Union members who
    have continued as employees of Nortel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, this argument must fail.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two preliminary points should be made.  First, as the motion judge wrote at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 47 of his reasons, the acknowledged purpose of the <i>CCAA</i> <span class=GramE>is</span> to
    facilitate the making of a compromise or arrangement between an insolvent
    debtor company and its creditors, to the end that the company is able to
    continue in business.  The primary
    instrument provided by the <i>CCAA</i> to
    achieve its purpose is the power of the court to issue a broad stay of
    proceedings under s. 11.  That power includes
    the power to stay the debt obligations of the company.  The order of January 14, 2009 is an exercise
    of that power, and must be read in the context of the purpose of the
    legislation.  Nonetheless, it is
    important to underline that, while that order stays those obligations, it does
    not eliminate them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, we also agree with the motion judge when he stated
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 66:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>In my
    view, section 11.3 is an exception to the general stay provision authorized by
    section 11 provided for in the Initial Order.&nbsp; As such, it seems to me
    that section 11.3 should be narrowly construed.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of s. 11.3(a) of the <i>CCAA</i>, the January 14, 2009 order cannot stay Nortel’s obligation to
    make immediate payment for the services provided to it after the date of the
    order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What then does the collective agreement require of
    Nortel as payment for the work done by its continuing employees?  The straightforward answer is that the
    collective agreement sets out in detail the compensation that Nortel must pay
    and the benefits it must provide to its employees in return for their
    services.  That bargain is at the heart
    of the collective agreement.  Indeed, as
    counsel for the Union candidly acknowledged, the typical grievance, if services
    of employees went unremunerated, would be to seek as a remedy not what might be
    owed to former employees but only the payment of compensation and benefits owed
    under the collective agreement to those employees who provided the services.  Indeed, that package of compensation and
    benefits represents the commercially reasonable contractual obligation resting
    on Nortel for the supply of services by those continuing employees.  It is that which is protected by s. 11.3(a)
    from the reach of the January 14, 2009 order: see <i>Re:</i> <i>Mirant Canada Energy
    Marketing Ltd.</i> (2004), 36 Alta. L.R. (4th) 87 (Q.B.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can it be said that the payment required for the
    services provided by the continuing employees of Nortel also extends to
    encompass the periodic payments to the former employees in question in this
    case?  In our opinion, for the following
    reasons the answer is clearly no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The periodic payments to former employees are payments
    under various retirement programs, and termination and severance payments.  All are products of the ongoing collective
    bargaining process and the collective agreements it has produced over time.  As Krever J.A. wrote regarding analogous
    benefits in <i>Metropolitan Police Service
    Board v. Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board et al.</i> (1999), 45
    O.R. (3d) 622 (C.A.) at 629, it can be assumed that the cost of these benefits
    was considered in the overall compensation package negotiated when they were
    created by predecessor collective agreements.  These benefits may therefore reasonably be thought of as deferred
    compensation under those predecessor agreements.  In other words, they are compensation
    deferred from past agreements but provided currently as periodic payments owing
    to former employees for prior services.  The services for which these payments constitute “payment” under the <i>CCAA</i> were those provided under
    predecessor agreements, not the services currently being performed for
    Nortel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the rights of former employees to these
    periodic payments remain currently enforceable even though those rights were
    created under predecessor collective agreements.  They become a form of “vested” right, although
    they may only be enforceable by the Union on behalf of the former employees: see <span class=SpellE><i>Dayco</i></span><i> (Canada) Ltd. v. CAW-Canada, </i>[1993] 2
    S.C.R. 230 at 274.  That is entirely
    inconsistent with the periodic payments constituting payment for current
    services.  If current service was the
    source of the obligation to make these periodic payments then, if there were no
    current services being performed, the obligation would evaporate and the right
    of the former employees to receive the periodic payments would disappear.  It would in no sense be a “vested” right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, we can find no basis upon which the Union’s
    position can be sustained.  The periodic
    payments in issue cannot be characterized as part of the payment required of
    Nortel for the services provided to it by its continuing employees after
    January 14, 2009.  Section 11.3(a) of the <i>CCAA</i> does not exclude these payments
    from the effect of the order of that date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Union’s appeal must be dismissed. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FORMER EMPLOYEES’ APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Former Employees’ motion was brought by three men
    as representatives of former employees including pensioners and their
    survivors. On the motion their claim was for an order varying the Initial Order
    to require Nortel to pay termination pay, severance pay, vacation pay, an amount
    for continuation of the Nortel benefit plans during the notice period in
    accordance with the <i>Employment Standards
    Act, 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 41 (“<i>ESA</i>”)
    and any other provincial employment legislation. The representatives also
    sought an order varying the Initial Order to require Nortel to pay the
    Transitional Retirement Allowance (“TRA”) and certain pension benefit payments
    to affected former employees. The motion judge described the motion by the
    former employees as “not dissimilar to the CAW motion, such that the motion of
    the former employees can almost be described as a “Me too motion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After he dismissed the union motion, the motion judge
    turned to the “me too” motion of the former employees. The former employees
    wanted to achieve the same result as the unionized employees. The motion judge
    described their argument as based on the position that Nortel could not
    contract out of the
    <st1:stockticker w:st="on">
    <i>ESA</i> of Ontario or another province.  However, as he noted, rather than trying to
    contract out, it was acknowledged that the <i>ESA</i> applied, except that immediate payment of amounts owing as required by the <i>ESA</i> were stayed during the stay period
    under the Initial Order, so that the former employees could not enforce the
    acknowledged payment obligation during that time.  The motion judge concluded that on the same
    basis as the union motion, the former employees’ motion was also dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of the appeal, the former employees
    narrowed their claim only to statutory termination and severance claims under
    the <i>ESA</i> that were not being paid by
    Nortel pursuant to the Initial Order, and served a Notice of Constitutional
    Question.  The appellant asks this court
    to find that judges cannot use their discretion to order a stay under the <i>CCAA</i> that has the effect of overriding
    valid provincial minimum standards legislation where there is no conflict
    between the statutes and the doctrine of paramountcy has not been triggered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither the provincial nor the federal governments
    responded to the notice on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs 6 and 11 of the Initial Order (as amended)
    provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6. THIS COURT ORDERS that each of the Applicants,
    either on its own or on behalf of another Applicant, <i>shall be entitled but not required to pay</i> the following expenses
    whether incurred prior to, on or after the date of this Order:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       all
    outstanding and future wages, salaries and employee benefits (including but not
    limited to, employee medical and similar benefit plans, relocation and tax
    equalization programs, the Incentive Plan (as defined in the Doolittle
    affidavit) and employee assistance programs), current service, special and
    similar pension benefit payments, vacation pay, commissions and employee and
    director expenses, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business and
    consistent with existing compensation policies and arrangements;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11. THIS COURT ORDERS that each of the Applicants
    shall have the right to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>terminate</span> the
    employment of such of its employees or temporarily lay off such employees as it
    deems appropriate <i>and to deal with the
    consequences thereof in the Plan or on further order of the Court</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>all</span> of the foregoing to
    permit the Applicants to proceed with an orderly restructuring of the Business.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to these paragraphs, from the date of the
    Initial Order, Nortel stopped making payments to former employees as well as
    employees terminated following the Initial Order for certain retirement and
    pension allowances as well as for statutory severance and termination payments.
    The <i>ESA</i> sets out obligations to
    provide notice of termination of employment or payment in lieu of notice and
    severance pay in defined circumstances.  By virtue of s. 11(5), those payments must be
    made on the later of seven days after the date employment ends or the
    employee’s next pay date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the motion judge stated, it is acknowledged by all
    parties on this motion that the <i>ESA</i> continues to apply while a company is subject to a <i>CCAA</i> restructuring.  The
    issue is whether the company’s provincial statutory obligations for virtually
    immediate payment of termination and severance can be stayed by an order made
    under the <i>CCAA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 11(3), dealing with the initial application,
    and (4), dealing with subsequent applications under the <i>CCAA</i> are the stay provisions of the Act. Section 11(3) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11. (3) A court may, on an initial application in
    respect of a company, make an order on such terms as it may impose, effective
    for such period as the court deems necessary not exceeding thirty days,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       <span
class=GramE>staying</span>, until otherwise ordered by the court, all
    proceedings taken or that might be taken in respect of the company under an Act
    referred to in subsection 1; [the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Winding

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       <span

    proceedings in any action, suit or proceeding against the company;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       <span

    commencement of or proceeding with any other action, suit or proceeding against
    the company.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As earlier noted, the stay provisions of the <i>CCAA</i> are well recognized as the key to
    the successful operation of the <i>CCAA</i> restructuring process. As this court stated in <span class=SpellE><i>Stelco</i></span><i> Inc</i>.<i> (Re)</i> (2005), 75
    O.R. (3d) 5 at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the CCAA context, Parliament has provided a
    statutory framework to extend protection to a company while it holds its
    creditors at bay and attempts to negotiate a compromised plan of arrangement
    that will enable it to emerge and continue as a viable economic entity, thus
    benefiting society and the company in the long run, along with the company’s
    creditors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The s. 11 discretion
    is the engine that drives this broad and flexible statutory scheme…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament has carved out defined exceptions to the
    court’s ability to impose a stay. For example, s. 11.3(a) prohibits a stay of
    payments for goods and services provided after the initial order, so that while
    the company is given the opportunity and privilege to carry on during the <i>CCAA</i> restructuring process without
    paying its existing creditors, it is on a pay-as-you-go basis only. In
    contrast, there is no exception for statutory termination and severance pay.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Furthermore, as the respondent Boards of Directors point out, the recent
    amendments to the <i>CCAA</i> that came into
    force on
    <st1:date Year="2009" Day="18" Month="9" w:st="on">
    September 18, 2009
    do not address this issue, although they do deal in other respects with
    employee-related matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As there is no specific protection from the general
    stay provision for <i>ESA</i> termination
    and severance payments, the question to be determined is whether the court is
    entitled to extend the effect of its stay order to such payments based on the
    constitutional doctrine of paramountcy: <i>Crystalline
    Investments Ltd. v. <span class=SpellE>Domgroup</span> Ltd</i>., [2004] 1
    S.C.R. 60 at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The scope, intent and effect of the operation of the
    doctrine of paramountcy was recently reviewed and summarized by <span
class=SpellE>Binnie</span> and Lebel JJ. <span class=GramE>in</span> <i>Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta</i>, [2007]
    2 S.C.R. 3<i> </i>at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    69-75. <span class=GramE>They</span> reaffirmed the “conflict” test stated by
    Dickson J. in <i>Multiple Access Ltd.
    v.  McCutcheon</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R.161:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In principle, there would seem to be no good
    reasons to speak of paramountcy and preclusion except where there is actual
    conflict in operation as where one enactment says “yes” and the other says
    “no”; “the same citizens are being told to do inconsistent things”; compliance
    with one is defiance of the other. [p. 191]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, they also explained an important proviso or
    gloss on the strict conflict rule that has developed in the case law since <i>Multiple Access</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nevertheless, there will be cases in which imposing
    an obligation to comply with provincial legislation would in effect frustrate
    the purpose of a federal law even though it did not entail a direct violation
    of the federal law’s provisions.&nbsp; The Court recognized this in Bank of
    Montreal v. Hall, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 121, in noting that Parliament’s “intent”
    must also be taken into account in the analysis of incompatibility.&nbsp; The
    Court thus acknowledged that the impossibility of complying with two enactments
    is not the sole sign of incompatibility.&nbsp; The fact that a provincial law
    is incompatible with the purpose of a federal law will also be sufficient to
    trigger the application of the doctrine of federal paramountcy.&nbsp; This
    point was recently reaffirmed in <span class=SpellE>Mangat</span> and in
    Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 188, 2005
    <st1:stockticker
w:st="on">
    SCC 13. (<span class=SpellE>para</span>. 73)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the doctrine of paramountcy will apply
    either where a provincial and a federal statutory provision are in conflict and
    cannot both be complied with, or where complying with the provincial law will
    have the effect of frustrating the purpose of the federal law and therefore the
    intent of Parliament. <span class=SpellE>Binnie</span> and Lebel JJ. concluded
    by summarizing the operation of the doctrine in the following way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To sum up, the onus is on the party relying on the
    doctrine of federal paramountcy to demonstrate that the federal and provincial
    laws are in fact incompatible by establishing either that it is impossible to
    comply with both laws or that to apply the provincial law would frustrate the purpose
    of the federal law. (<span class=SpellE>para</span>. 75)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA</i> stay
    provision is a clear example of a case where the intent of Parliament, to allow
    the court to freeze the debt obligations owing to all creditors for past
    services (and goods) in order to permit a company to restructure for the
    benefit of all stakeholders, would be frustrated if the court’s stay order
    could not apply to statutory termination and severance payments owed to
    terminated employees in respect of past services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record before the court indicates that the motion
    judge made the initial order and the amended order in the context of the
    insolvency of a complex, multinational conglomerate as part of co-ordinated
    proceedings in a number of countries including the U.S. In June 2009, an
    Interim Funding and Settlement Agreement was negotiated which, together with
    the proceeds of certain ongoing asset sales, is providing funds necessary in
    the view of the court appointed Monitor, for the ongoing operations of Nortel
    during the next few months of the <i>CCAA</i> oversight operation. This funding was achieved on the basis that the stay
    applied to the severance and termination payments. The Monitor advises that if
    these payments were not subject to the stay and had to be funded, further
    financing would have to be found to do that and also maintain operations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that context, the motion judge exercised his
    discretion to impose a stay that could extend to the severance and termination
    payments. He considered the financial position of Nortel, that it was not
    carrying “business as usual” and that it was under financial pressure. He also
    considered that the <i>CCAA</i> proceeding
    is at an early stage, before the claims of creditor groups, including former
    employees and others have been considered or classified for ultimate treatment
    under a plan of arrangement. He noted that employees have no statutory priority
    and their claims are not secured claims. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While reference was made to the paramountcy doctrine by
    the motion judge, it was not the main focus of the argument before him. Nevertheless,
    he effectively concluded that it would thwart the intent of Parliament for the
    successful conduct of the <i>CCAA</i> restructuring if the initial order and the amended order could not include a
    stay provision that allowed Nortel to suspend the payment of statutory
    obligations for termination and severance under the <i>ESA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents also argued that if the stay did not
    apply to statutory termination and severance obligations, then the employees
    who received these payments would in effect be receiving a “super-priority”
    over other unsecured or possibly even secured creditors on the assumption that
    in the end there will not be enough money to pay everyone in full. We agree
    that this may be the effect if the stay does not apply to these payments.
    However, that could also be the effect if Nortel chose to make such payments,
    as it is entitled to do under paragraph 6 (a) of the amended initial order. Of
    course, in that case, any such payments would be made in consultation with
    appropriate parties including the Monitor, resulting in the effective grant of
    a consensual rather than a mandatory priority. Even in this case, the motion
    judge provided a “hardship” alleviation program funded up to $750,000, to allow
    payments to former employees in clear need.  This will have the effect of granting the
    “super-priority” to some. This is an acceptable result in appropriate
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, this result does not in any way undermine the
    paramountcy analysis. That analysis is driven by the need to preserve the
    ability of the <i>CCAA</i> court to ensure,
    through the scope of the stay order, that Parliament’s intent for the operation
    of the <i>CCAA</i> regime is not thwarted by
    the operation of provincial legislation. The court issuing the stay order
    considers all of the circumstances and can impose an order that has the effect
    of overriding a provincial enactment where it is necessary to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morawetz J. was satisfied that such a stay was
    necessary in the circumstances of this case. We see no error in that conclusion
    on the record before him and before this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another issue was raised based on the facts of this
    restructuring as it has developed.  It
    appears that the company will not be restructured, but instead its assets will
    be sold.  It is necessary to continue
    operations in order to maintain maximum value for this process to achieve the
    highest prices and therefore the best outcome for all stakeholders.  It is true that the basis for the very broad
    stay power has traditionally been expressed as a necessary aspect of the restructuring
    process, leading to a plan of arrangement for the newly restructured entity.
    However, we see no reason in the present circumstances why the same analysis
    cannot apply during a sale process that requires the business to be carried on
    as a going concern.  No party has taken
    the position that the <i>CCAA</i> process is
    no longer available because it is not proceeding as a restructuring, nor has
    any party taken steps to turn the proceeding into one under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, <span class=GramE>c</span>. B-3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The former employee appellants have raised the
    constitutional question whether the doctrine of paramountcy applies to give to
    the <i>CCAA</i> judge the authority, under
    s. 11 of the Act, to order a stay of proceedings that has the effect of
    overriding s. 11(5) of the <i>ESA</i>, which
    requires almost immediate payment of termination and severance obligations.  The answer to this question is yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note again that the question before this court was
    limited to the effect of the stay on the timing of required statutory payments
    under the <i>ESA</i> and does not deal with
    the inter-relation of the <i>ESA</i> and the <i>CCAA</i> for the purposes of the plan of
    arrangement and the ultimate payment of these statutory obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal by the former employees is also dismissed.</p>
