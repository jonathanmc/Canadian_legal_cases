  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allpoetry.com is a website where members can post poems
    they have written. S.A., a 17-year-old high school student, and her younger
    sister, J.A., were members of allpoetry.com in 2006.  Each posted poems on the website.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.A. wrote a poem, Black Dark, and posted it on
    allpoetry.com.  The poem referred to the
    first of two sexual assaults she alleged were committed on her by a member of
    her extended family, J.M.H.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At J.M.H.s trial on two counts of sexual assault,
    counsel for J.M.H. relied on the argument that S.A.s conduct after each
    alleged offence, in particular her continued contact with J.M.H. and delay in
    making any complaint, was inconsistent with her later claims of sexual
    assault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The poem, Black Dark, made its way into evidence as
    an exhibit at J.M.H.s trial.  Although
    S.A. was cross-examined on certain aspects of the poem, the prosecutor chose to
    file Black Dark as an exhibit during the examination-in-chief of J.A.  The basis for admission advanced by the
    prosecutor was that the poem would assist in establishing the narrative of
    S.A.s complaint, thereby deflecting J.M.H.s assertion that S.A.s later
    conduct negated the truthfulness of her allegations of sexual assault.  The prosecutor denied any reliance on the
    poem to establish the truth of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel for J.M.H. (the respondent) objected to
    the admission of the poem as evidence, but was more concerned about the
    prosecutor inviting J.A., who was not the author of the poem, to give evidence
    about the meaning of the poem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At issue here is the manner in which the trial judge
    used the poem in concluding that the prosecutor had failed to establish beyond
    a reasonable doubt that S.A. did not consent to have sexual intercourse with the
    respondent on each occasion charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the Crowns
    appeal from the respondents acquittal on both counts of the indictment and
    order a new trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            Overview</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case for the prosecution was that on two occasions
    about three months apart, February 11 and May 20, 2006, S.A. stayed overnight
    at J.M.H.s house.  On each occasion,
    S.A. lay down on J.M.H.s bed.  J.M.H.
    was on the opposite side of the bed.  On
    February 11, 2006, S.A. was intoxicated.  On May 20, 2006, S.A. was sober.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In both February and May, J.M.H. moved from his side of
    the bed towards S.A.  Each time, he made
    sexual advances that S.A. rejected. Finally, J.M.H. removed S.A.s lower
    clothing, as well as his own, and had unprotected sexual intercourse with her
    without her consent.  After each
    incident, S.A. continued to visit J.M.H.s house and to hang out with him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.M.H., who had no previous convictions, gave evidence
    on his own behalf.  He could not recall
    ever having slept in the same bed as S.A. and denied ever having sexually
    assaulted her.</p>
  <h3>The Poem Black Dark</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.A. wrote the poem Black Dark after the alleged sexual
    assault of February 11, 2006, but told no one about the alleged assaults until
    five months after the second alleged assault had occurred.  S.A. acknowledged that Black Dark contained
    no explicit reference to J.M.H., sexual intercourse, or the events or date of
    February 11, 2006.  The poem was written
    as fact, however, not as her interpretation of events, although the poem
    itself, she conceded, was open to interpretation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.A. was cross-examined on some aspects of Black
    Dark, but neither party tendered it as an exhibit during her testimony.</p>
  <h3>Black
    Dark Becomes an Exhibit</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor called J.A. as the second prosecution
    witness.  Trial counsel for the
    respondent objected on the ground that J.A. had no relevant evidence to
    give.  Despite the objection, trial
    counsel appears to have acquiesced in the witness giving evidence, subject to
    arguments later about the relevance of her testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.A. confirmed that she and S.A. had stayed overnight
    at J.M.H.s house on one occasion sometime during the first two weeks of
    February, 2006.  J.A. fell asleep on a
    couch in the living room.  When she awoke
    the following morning, S.A. was in J.M.H.s bedroom.  The two sisters left together. S.A. said nothing
    about anything unusual having happened the previous evening.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.A. read Black Dark in September, 2006, on the allpoetry.com
    website.  She confirmed that the poem
    shown to her by the prosecutor during examination-in-chief was the poem she had
    read. After re-reading the poem a few times, J.A. concluded that something had
    happened and discussed it with S.A.  The
    poem was entered and filed as an exhibit at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor explained that she was offering the poem
    as part of the narrative of S.A.s complaint and to rebut the position advanced
    on J.M.H.s behalf that the complainants conduct after the alleged offence, in
    particular her continued association with J.M.H. and her failure to complain,
    diminished her credibility and, equally, the reliability of her account. The
    prosecutor made it clear that she was <i>not</i> tendering the poem to establish the proof of its contents.</p>
  <h3>The
    Submissions of Trial Counsel</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their final submissions to the trial judge, counsel
    discussed the use the trial judge should make of the poem, Black Dark, in
    deciding the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel for the respondent urged the trial judge
    to give no weight to the poem.  Black
    Dark made no specific reference to J.M.H. or to the events of February 11,
    2006.  Like all poetry, Black Dark was
    subject to interpretation and should be given an interpretation that was most
    favourable to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor contended that the poem supported S.A.s
    version of the events of February 11, 2006. Its composition was contemporaneous
    with those events and accurately recounted them in poetic form.</p>
  <h3>The
    Reasons of the Trial Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted, without hesitation, S.A.s
    evidence that the respondent had sexual intercourse with her on February 11,
    2006, and again on May 20, 2006.  He
    rejected and was left in no reasonable doubt by the respondents denials.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to the issue of
    consent.  He accepted that S.A. had
    written the poem, Black Dark, the day following the events of February 11,
    2006, as a result of those events and as an outlet for what had occurred.  He did not consider S.A.s delay in reporting
    either occurrence to be a factor telling against the veracity of her account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge focused on two passages in the poem in
    concluding that the prosecutor had failed to prove that sexual intercourse took
    place without S.A.s consent:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When I read her description of the incidents on
    February 11<sup>th</sup>, concerns are raised.  She describes the incident on February 11<sup>th</sup> as:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>First taste</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>So bittersweet</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Why?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>First taste</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>So bittersweet</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Hardly the words that describe a rape.  Hardly the words that describe an incident
    that is so damaging to her that she cannot cope with it.  But she doesnt end there.  She says,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Evil invading</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Her body.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Its too late</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Regret</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Regret? Regret conjures an image of someone who has made a decision and wishes
    she had not made it. Regret.  Why
    should she regret if she has been raped?  Why should she regret if she has been violated? And why did she insist
    in going back to the same bed that she had been violated in?  She may be young, but she is 17.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I suspect very strongly, when I read her poem,
    First taste so bittersweet, that she was confused, that she wrestled with
    going into that room.  She said she went
    to the bed on her own and it wasnt even discussed. Why? She is a bright, young
    women, very articulate.  She is a very
    good writer.  She expresses herself
    exceedingly clearly.  And she insists
    that alcohol did not cloud her memory.  It clearly did not cloud her ability to make decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In all of the circumstances of this case,
    notwithstanding that I do not believe the accused, notwithstanding that I am
    satisfied that sexual intercourse did occur on both of these occasions, I
    cannot be satisfied that she was sexually assaulted without her consent. I am
    satisfied that she regretted that what had happened, that she found it
    bittersweet.  Strange words for someone
    who testifies of violence that occurred to her.  It is more in keeping with experimentation, more in keeping with taking
    a chance, more in keeping with growing up as a young person and making a
    mistake.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her notice of appeal, Crown counsel alleged that the
    trial judge made two errors of law:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          he misapprehended the evidence,
    including, but not only, the poem Black
    Dark; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         he failed to apply the correct standard
    of reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, Ms. Campbell contended that the legal
    error made by the trial judge was that he considered two portions of the poem
    in isolation, rather than in the context of and together with the balance of
    the evidence, including the balance of the poem.  Upon proper consideration, the verdict
    rendered would not necessarily have been the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on my ultimate conclusion on the first issue, it
    is unnecessary to consider the second allegation of error as a distinct ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essence of the appellants complaint is that the
    trial judge misused the poem written by S.A. to ground his finding that the
    prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual
    intercourse between the respondent and S.A. was without S.A.s consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the error alleged and the circumstances
    in which it arises require consideration of several related issues including,
    but not limited to, whether, as framed, the ground advanced raises a question
    of law alone and, if it does, whether Crown counsel has satisfied the onus
    required for this court to order a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b>The Positions of the Parties on Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Campbell for the appellant says that the trial
    judge erred in his approach to the evidence relating to the issue of
    non-consent.  The trial judge was
    required to consider <i>all</i> the evidence
    relevant to the one material issue that remained after he had found that the
    respondent had had sexual intercourse with S.A.: non-consent.  Instead, the trial judge focussed on two
    passages in the poem, Black Dark, an item of evidence that had been admitted
    for a limited purpose.  He treated the
    poem as if it had been received as a prior inconsistent statement and held that
    it raised a reasonable doubt about S.A.s denial of consent.  In effect, speculation became a surrogate for
    reasonable doubt.  But for these errors,
    which combined speculation and misapprehension of evidence, the verdict would
    not necessarily have been the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the respondent, Mr. Feldmann submits that, in the
    absence of any shift in the burden of proof to an accused, of which none exists
    here, there is always evidence on which to make a finding favourable to an
    accused.  Such a finding, if in error,
    the authorities establish, is an error of fact, not an error of law cognizable on
    an appeal by the Crown under s. 676(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Feldmann characterizes the appellants complaint as
    one that relates <i>not</i> to speculation,
    but rather to the weight that the trial judge assigned to an item of
    evidence.  Errors in weighing evidence
    are not errors of law.  What is more,
    even if the trial judge erred in law by treating or interpreting the poem as a
    prior inconsistent statement by S.A., thus a factor in assessing her
    credibility, it was simply one of several factors that raised a reasonable
    doubt about the denial of consent.  Even
    on this view, the appellant has failed to show that the verdict would not
    necessarily have been the same had the error not been made.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Question
    of Law Requirement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In proceedings by indictment, Crown appeals from
    acquittals entered by trial courts are restricted to grounds of appeal that
    involve questions of law alone: <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 676(1)(a).  In the absence
    of an all-encompassing definition or exhaustive list of what constitutes a
    question of law alone, the grounds advanced in individual cases require careful
    scrutiny to determine whether they fall within or lie beyond the restrictions
    imposed by s. 676(1)(a).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>                        <b>Admissibility
    and Assessment of Evidence as Questions of Law Alone</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that the admissibility of evidence
    is a question of law: <i>R. v. B. (G.)</i>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at p. 71.  What
    appears less clear is the extent to which the assessment of properly admissible
    evidence in a particular case also raises a question of law alone, thus is
    cognizable on appeals from acquittal under s. 676(1)(a).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A misapprehension of evidence may involve a failure to
    consider evidence relevant to a material issue, a mistake about the substance
    of the evidence, or a failure to assign proper effect to the evidence: <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514
    (C.A.), at p. 538.  To determine in any
    given case whether a particular misapprehension of evidence amounts to an error
    of law alone is a question that is not entirely unencumbered with difficulty: <i>Morrissey</i> at p. 538.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown is not entitled to contest an acquittal on
    the ground that the acquittal is unreasonable or not supported by the
    evidence.  Sections 686(1)(a)(i) and (ii)
    clearly distinguish between unreasonable and unsupportable verdicts, on the one
    hand, and wrong decisions on questions of law, on the other.  Implicit in the dispositive authority enacted
    by s. 686(1)(a) is the correlative right of a person convicted of an indictable
    offence to challenge the conviction on the ground of unreasonableness.  No such authority is furnished to the Crown or
    court on appeals from acquittal: <i>Sunbeam
    Corp. (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen</i>, [1969] S.C.R. 221, at pp. 237-238; <i>B. (G.) </i>at pp. 67-68.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial judge must take a legally correct approach to
    the evidence in a case, lest the final step in the process of adjudication,
    weighing the evidence, be flawed: <i>B. (G.)</i> at p. 77.  As a necessary corollary to
    the proposition just stated, an erroneous approach to or treatment of the
    evidence adduced at trial constitutes legal error: <i>B. (G.)</i> at p. 71; see also <i>Wild
    v. The Queen</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 101, at pp. 111-112.  It is equally wrong to ground a reasonable
    doubt on pure conjecture: see <i>Wild </i>at
    p. 117. Misapprehension or lack of appreciation of relevant evidence only
    amounts to legal error where there is a self-misdirection by the trial judge on
    the applicable legal principles: <i>B. (G.)</i> at p. 75.  On appeals from acquittal, it
    is more difficult to establish with certainty that the error raises a question
    of law alone because of the Crowns burden of proof and the enhanced importance
    of examining critically all evidence that may raise a reasonable doubt: <i>B. (G.) </i>at p. 75.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial judges failure to direct her or himself to <i>all</i> the evidence relevant to a material
    issue may amount to legal error: <i>B. (G.)</i> at p. 72.  It is also legally wrong for a
    trial judge to fail to consider individual items of evidence in the context of
    the evidence as a whole; in other words, it is wrong to use a piecemeal
    approach, extracting individual items from their evidentiary surroundings: see <i>B. (G.)</i> at p. 77.  It is all the more so where the individual
    items are subjected to the standard of proof required of the evidence as a
    whole: see <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2
    S.C.R. 345, at p. 359.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, findings of fact made in the absence
    of <i>any</i> supportive evidence are errors
    of law: <i>R. v. Schuldt</i>, [1985] 2
    S.C.R. 592, at p. 604.  Where the finding
    of fact made in the absence of evidence is an acquittal, however, an error of
    law occurs only where there has been a transfer to the accused by law of the
    burden of proving a particular fact: <i>Schuldt</i> at p. 604. </p>
  <h3>Poems as Evidence in Criminal Cases</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, a party may seek to make use of a poem
    during the course of a criminal prosecution.  The purpose for which the party may seek to use the poem may vary.  A poem may constitute the means by which the
    Crown alleges an offence has been committed, as it did in <i>R. v. Batista</i>, 2008 ONCA 804. A poem found among an accuseds
    possessions may be offered in evidence as an admission to help establish the
    accuseds liability: <i>R. v. Terry</i>,
    [1996] 2 S.C.R. 207, at paras. 29-30.  In
    these circumstances, the poem is usually tendered as an exhibit in written
    form, its authorship or custody established by various witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law of evidence accords no special place for poems.  No unique rule applies.  As with other items of evidence received for
    substantive purposes, a poem tendered for reception must be relevant, material
    and <i>not</i> in contravention of any
    applicable admissibility rule.  As with
    other items of evidence, a poem may also be of limited admissibility:
    admissible for one purpose or in relation to one accused, but not for or in
    relation to another purpose or accused.  Poems, like other items of evidence of limited admissibility, must be
    confined to the use the adjective law permits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some instances, a poem might be used to refresh
    memory, as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach the credibility of its
    author, or as a prior consistent statement to rebut an allegation of recent
    fabrication.  In none of these examples
    would the poem become evidence of the truth of its contents (apart from
    adoption in the case of its use as a prior inconsistent statement).  Nor would the poem become an exhibit in the
    proceedings.  Substantive use of a poem as
    a prior out-of-court statement of the poet/declarant would require satisfaction
    of the principles of necessity and reliability.  </p>
  <h3>The Test Applicable to Appeals from Acquittal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Criminal Code</i> demands more of the Crown on an appeal from an acquittal in indictable
    proceedings than mere demonstration of a legal error by the trial judge in the
    conduct of those proceedings.  What is
    more is a demonstrated nexus between the legal error and the judgment or
    verdict of acquittal: see <i>R. v. Graveline</i>,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 17. The Crown must satisfy the appellate court
    that the legal errors might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of
    the case under consideration, to have had a material bearing on the acquittal: <i>Graveline</i> at para. 14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate courts do not lightly overturn acquittals: <i>R. v. Sutton</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 595, at
    para. 2.  The onus imposed on the Crown
    is a heavy one, although it does not extend to persuasion of the appellate
    court that the verdict would necessarily have been different: <i>Graveline</i> at para. 14. What the Crown
    must establish, with a reasonable degree of certainty, is that the verdict
    would not necessarily have been the same had the errors not been made: <i>Morin</i> at p. 374; <i>Graveline</i> at para. 16; <i>Sutton</i> at para. 2; <i>R. v. Vezeau</i>, [1977] 2
    S.C.R. 277, at p. 292.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p>                        <b>Introduction</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to establish the respondents guilt of the
    offences charged, the prosecutor had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          that the respondent intentionally
    applied force to S.A.;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         that S.A. did not consent to the force
    that the respondent intentionally
    applied;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       that the respondent knew that S.A. did
    not consent to the force that the
    respondent intentionally applied; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.        that the force that the respondent
    intentionally applied to S.A. took place
    in circumstances of a sexual nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that on both dates described in the indictment, the respondent had sexual
    intercourse with S.A.  The trial judge
    accepted, without hesitation, S.A.s evidence that sexual intercourse took
    place. He did not accept or have a reasonable doubt about the respondents
    denials of any sexual contact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite his acceptance of S.A.s testimony that the
    respondent had sexual intercourse with her, the trial judge had a reasonable
    doubt whether the intercourse took place without S.A.s consent.  What ripens for decision here is whether this
    finding was flawed by legal error, in particular the trial judges apparent
    conscription of the poem, Black Dark, to ground his conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is helpful to begin the discussion with an
    evaluation of the circumstances in which the poem made its way into evidence at
    trial. </p>
  <h3>The Poem as Evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was uncontested at trial that S.A. wrote the poem,
    Black Dark, and posted it on a website to which she subscribed.  The trial judge found that the poem was
    inspired by and referred to the incident of February 11, 2006.  It was written within one day of the
    incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.A. was cross-examined on some of the contents of the
    poem.  Portions of the poem seemed to
    have been used to impeach S.A. on the basis that it contained no specifics to
    link its contents to S.A.s claim of an uninvited and non-consensual sexual
    attack on February 11, 2006.  The
    cross-examiner did not tender a copy of the poem to S.A. or seek its admission
    as an exhibit during her testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When J.A. testified, she confirmed an overnight stay at
    the respondents home and S.A.s emergence from the respondents bedroom the
    next morning. The prosecutor produced a copy of the poem to J.A. who confirmed
    that she had read it several times on the allpoetry.com website in September,
    2006.  J.A. knew that S.A. was the author
    of the poem and concluded from the poems contents that something bad had
    happened to S.A. sometime earlier.  J.A.
    then discussed the poem with S.A. and learned of the alleged sexual assault by
    the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor tendered a copy of the poem as an
    exhibit during examination-in-chief of J.A. The announced purpose of its
    introduction was as part of the narrative of S.A.s complaint, in particular to
    diminish the force of the respondents claim that S.A.s failure to complain
    and other conduct following the first incident told against her credibility and
    the reliability of her account. The prosecutor made it clear that she was <i>not </i>tendering a poem to establish the
    truth of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is clear from the evidence of both S.A. and
    J.A. that Black Dark, like other poems, is subject to interpretation.  It could mean different things to different
    people.  The prosecutor invited the trial
    judge to use Black Dark, contrary to the basis on which she had proposed its
    admission, to support S.A.s account of forced sexual intercourse on February
    11, 2006.</p>
  <h3>The Decision on Absence of Consent</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge turned his attention to the requirement
    that the prosecutor prove beyond a reasonable doubt that S.A. was sexually
    assaulted on February 11 and May 20, and it was without her consent.  He opened his discussion of the adequacy of
    the prosecutors proof with four findings of fact relating to Black
    Dark:  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          that the poem was written as a result
    of S.A.s experience with the    respondent
    on February 11, 2006;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         that the poem was written very soon
    after the incident, perhaps the   following
    day;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       that the poem described the incident of
    February 11, 2006; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.        that the poem was written as an outlet.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge quoted the poem in its entirety, then
    made it clear that S.A.s delay in making complaint about the offence charged
    was of no significance in determining whether the sexual intercourse with the
    respondent had taken place without S.A.s consent.  In other words, the delay in reporting did not
    raise or contribute to a reasonable doubt that the intercourse was without
    S.A.s consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to S.A.s description of
    the incidents on February 11th, as recounted in Black Dark, and noted that
    concerns are raised.  The judge
    concluded that two passages in the poem were incompatible with non-consensual
    intercourse, especially when coupled with S.A.s return to the same bed in
    which she had been violated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons of the trial judge make <i>no </i>reference<i> </i>to the sworn testimony of S.A. given at trial.  </p>
  <h3>Was there an error?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my respectful view, the trial judge erred in the
    approach he took to the evidence that was relevant to the consent/non-consent
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was for the prosecutor to establish beyond a
    reasonable doubt that S.A. did not consent to the respondents conduct that
    culminated in acts of sexual intercourse on February 11 and May 20, 2006.  The determination of that issue required the
    trial judge to consider the cumulative effect of <i>all</i> the evidence that was relevant to that inquiry.  The prosecutor was entitled to a
    determination of this essential element of her proof on a full, not partial
    evidentiary predicate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sexual assault prosecutions, consent refers to the
    complainants state of mind.  Consent
    means the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
    activity in issue.  Consent is
    situational: the voluntary agreement of S.A. that the respondent do what he
    did, in the way and at the time he did it.  And whether consent was provided or denied fell to be decided on all the
    evidence about the circumstances surrounding the sexual activity in issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony of S.A. provided the only direct evidence
    on the consent/non-consent issue. S.A. also testified about the circumstances
    that preceded and followed each act of intercourse as well as about her return
    to the respondents home on various occasions between and after the
    incidents.  The respondent denied any
    sexual activity with S.A. at any time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of S.A.s testimony that the poem was written
    shortly after and was a factual account of the events of February 11, 2006, it
    was open to the trial judge to consider its impact on the credibility of S.A.
    and the reliability of her account of those events.  But the poem had to be considered as a whole
    and in the context of S.A.s sworn testimony of non-consensual sexual activity;
    in particular, forced sexual intercourse.  To ensure that the final step in the adjudicative process, the weighing
    of the evidence on the consent/non-consent issue, was not flawed, the trial
    judge was required to take the proper approach to the poem as evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was open to the trial judge to focus on specific
    passages in the poem in deciding the consent/non-consent issue.  What the trial judge was required but failed
    to do was to put those passages in their proper context of the poem as a whole
    and of S.A.s sworn testimony.  The trial
    judge had accepted S.A.s evidence that sexual intercourse had taken place, but
    never mentioned her testimony on the consent/non-consent issue, or said why he
    rejected it, apart from his reference to various isolated words in the poem on
    which S.A. was never questioned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appears to have used the poem about the
    events of February 11, 2006, to support his finding on the consent/non-consent
    issue in connection with the allegation of May 20, 2006.  I am unable to discern on what basis the poem
    had any value as a credibility or reliability factor in connection with the
    later incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the trial judge erred in his
    determination of the consent/non-consent issue in connection with both counts in
    the indictment.  His piecemeal approach
    to isolated words in the poem was incompatible with his obligation to consider
    the poem as a whole, and together with the rest of the evidence on the issue.</p>
  <h3>Was the error an error of law?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without minimizing the difficulty in appeals from
    acquittal of establishing with certainty that a judicial error raises a
    question of law alone, I am satisfied that the errors made here in the trial
    judges approach to the evidence on the consent/non-consent issue were errors
    of law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>B. (G.)</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada recognized appellate jurisdiction where the
    question of law originated from the trial judges conclusion that she or he is
    not convinced of an accuseds guilt because of an erroneous approach to, or
    treatment of the evidence adduced at trial: <i>B.
    (G.)</i> at p. 71.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge here failed to direct himself to <i>all</i> the evidence bearing on the issue of
    consent/non-consent, including both the balance of the poem and the central
    evidence of S.A.s sworn testimony denying consent and describing the circumstances
    in which the sexual activity occurred.  Further,
    consideration of the poem as dispositive of the consent/non-consent issue for
    the offence of May 20, 2006, constitutes legal error.</p>
  <h3>The Verdict Consequences of the Legal Errors</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acquittals are not overturned upon demonstration of
    legal error without more.  The Crown
    shoulders a heavy onus, one discharged only upon a showing, with a reasonable
    degree of certainty, that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same
    had the errors not occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the trial judge recorded his finding that on both February
    11 and May 20, 2006, the respondent had sexual intercourse with S.A., consent
    became the critical issue.  The
    respondent denied that any sexual activity had occurred, thus did not give
    evidence that S.A. consented to what occurred.  To rebut the presumption of innocence, the prosecutor relied on the
    sworn testimony of S.A. denying consent, as well as the circumstances of the
    sexual activity as she described them.  The prosecutor was entitled to a legally correct approach to and
    treatment of the evidence on the consent/non-consent issue and to have <i>all</i> the evidence considered
    cumulatively.  What the prosecutor got
    was a piecemeal approach to a single item of evidence, a poem, introduced for a
    limited purpose as part of the narrative of the complaint.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge <i>did</i> consider other aspects of S.A.s conduct in his discussion of the
    consent/non-consent issue. Her return to the same bed after sexual intercourse
    on February 11, 2006, then again on May 20, 2006.  The effect of her consumption of alcohol on
    February 11, 2006.  The inconsistencies
    between the versions of S.A. and J.A. about the events of the morning following
    the February incident.  But it was the
    isolated passages in the poem, particularly the references to regret and
    bittersweet that tilted the balance in favour of acquittal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After anxious consideration, I am unable to conclude
    that the verdict would necessarily have been the same without the erroneous
    approach to and treatment of the poem as evidence by the trial judge.</p>
