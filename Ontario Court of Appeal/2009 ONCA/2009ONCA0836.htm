    August 26, 1995, the appellant was injured in a motor vehicle accident.  The respondent’s corporate predecessor paid

    January 23, 2000, the respondent wrote to the appellant advising that it was “not

    weekly ‘income replacement benefits’ for any interval of time through to the present.” </span></p>

    letter went on to indicate that the appellant was entitled to dispute a
    decision of the insurer by applying for mediation and, if necessary, taking
    other steps subsequent to mediation pursuant to ss. 279 to 283 of the <i>Act</i> (the dispute resolution
    process).  In its letter, the respondent
    enclosed copies of the noted sections of the <i>Act</i>, as well as, a complete copy of the <i>SABS<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    with any forms.  The letter then stated:</span></p>

    that you have already participated in two mediations about your accident
    benefits claim, we trust you are adequately aware of your rights and

    information or guidance, please contact your counsel, or in the event you have
    no counsel, please write to us with any specific questions you may have.</span></p>

    March 8, 2007, the appellant commenced an action seeking payments for, among
    other things, attendant care, housekeeping and home maintenance benefits owing
    since 1998, as well as, funding for case management services since February
    2006.  In December 2007, the appellant
    moved to amend his statement of claim to include a claim for income replacement
    benefits and/or caregiver benefits </span><span style='line-height:200%'>and/or other disability benefits owing since January 31, 1997.  The motion, originally returnable in December

    claims being asserted in the amended statement of claim were barred by the
    two-year limitation period in s. 281(5) of the <i>Act</i>.  That section provides
    that a court or an arbitration proceeding in respect of statutory accident
    benefits must be commenced “within two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay

    issue in this appeal is whether the motion judge erred in finding that the

    gave the appellant proper notice of its refusal to pay the benefits in
    accordance with s. 71 of the <i>SABS</i>.  That section imposed a requirement on
    insurers when refusing to pay benefits to inform a claimant of the dispute
    resolution process available under the <i>Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>71.  If an insurer refuses to pay a benefit that a
    person has applied for under this Regulation or reduces the amount of a benefit
    that a person received under this Regulation, the insurer shall inform the
    person in writing of the procedure for resolving disputes relating to benefits
    under sections 279 to 283 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>.</span></p>

    appellant argues that the respondent did not give a valid refusal because it
    did not fulfill its obligations under s. 71 to explain the dispute resolution
    process to the appellant.  He also argues
    that merely providing copies of the sections of the legislation relating to
    that process is insufficient.  The
    appellant relies on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Smith v. </i></span><i><span style='line-height:200%'>Co-operators
    General Insurance Co.</span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 129, in support of these arguments.  </span></p>

    J., for the majority, held that the insurer’s refusal did not constitute a
    proper refusal to pay benefits so as to trigger the two-year limitation period because
    the refusal did not include an adequate description of the procedure for
    resolving  disputes as required by s. 71
    of the <i>SABS</i>.  He pointed out that one of the main
    objectives of insurance law is consumer protection.  Because of that, it was necessary to provide
    an insured with a description of the dispute resolution process in straightforward
    and clear language, directed towards an unsophisticated person.  He said, at para. 14:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my opinion, the insurer is required under s. 71 to inform the person of the
    dispute resolution process contained in ss. 279 to 283 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> in straightforward and
    clear language, directed towards an unsophisticated person.  At a minimum, this should include a
    description of the most important points of the process, such as the right to
    seek mediation, the right to arbitrate or litigate if mediation fails, that
    mediation must be attempted before resorting to arbitration or litigation and
    the relevant time limits that govern the entire process.  Without this basic information, it cannot be
    said that a valid refusal has been given.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Gonthier
    J. said, at para. 13, that it was questionable whether simply attaching to the
    refusal a verbatim reproduction of ss. 279 to 283 of the <i>Act</i> would qualify as a valid refusal because “it would surely run
    afoul of the consumer protection purpose of the legislation.”</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition, Gonthier J. rejected an argument that the court should consider
    circumstances beyond the insurer’s notice of refusal when determining whether
    the refusal was adequate.  In <i>Smith</i>, the insured had been informed of
    the limitation period in s. 281(5) through a mediation report.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  Gonthier J. rejected the insurer’s argument
    that the knowledge gained from the report could be used against the
    insured.  He reasoned, at para. <span
class=GramE>16, that because of the importance of protecting the consumers (the
    claimants), courts should “impose bright-line boundaries between the
    permissible and the impermissible without undue solicitude for particular
    circumstances that might operate against claimants in certain cases.”</span> </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    understand Gonthier J. to have said that in the context of an insurance company
    giving notice of its refusal to pay benefits, it must satisfy the requirements
    of s. 71 in its refusal.  Courts should
    not look to circumstances beyond the insurer’s notice of refusal, such as the
    mediator’s report in <i>Smith</i>, to
    relieve the insurance company of its obligation to provide a proper refusal.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, the respondent’s refusal to pay benefits in the present case meets the
    consumer protection rationale that underlies the decision in <i>Smith</i>.  It is important to note, the refusal sent out by the insurer in <i>Smith</i> was different in significant ways
    from the refusal in this case.  The notice
    of refusal in <i>Smith</i> stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>We
    have assessed your claim for accident benefits.  This form tells you how we calculated your benefits.  If you disagree with our assessment, please
    contact us immediately.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If
    we cannot settle the application to your satisfaction, you have the right to
    ask for mediation through the Ontario Insurance Commission.  You can contact them in Toronto [phone

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    court in <i>Smith</i> was very concerned
    that the refusal gave no indication that there was any further dispute resolution
    process beyond mediation.<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  The refusal made no mention of the complete dispute
    resolution process in the <i>Act</i>.  At para. 15, Gonthier J. said:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Given
    that s. 71 of the <i>SABS</i> imposes a
    requirement to inform the claimant of the dispute resolution process as
    discussed above, and <u>given that the respondent only informed the appellant
    of the first step of this process, a proper refusal cannot be said to have been
    given.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this case, the respondent’s letter of January 23, 2000, was much more complete
    than the notice of refusal in <i>Smith</i>.  Unlike the refusal in <i>Smith</i>, the letter referred to the statutory dispute resolution process
    and did so in two places.  It
    specifically referred to ss. 279 to 283 of the <i>Act</i> which set out the dispute resolution process and the relevant
    time limits.  The letter enclosed copies
    of those sections.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Importantly,
    the letter went on to refer to the fact that the appellant had participated in
    two mediations under the <i>Act</i> about
    his accident benefits claims. The letter then made the statement “we trust you
    are adequately aware of your rights and obligations with respect to the <u>dispute
    resolution process</u> outlined in the [<i>Act</i>]”
    (emphasis added).  In my view, it was
    reasonable for the respondent to assume that as a result of the appellant having
    previously been involved in two mediations under the <i>Act</i> he would be aware of the follow-up dispute resolution process
    and the relevant time limits.  In <i>Smith</i>, the claimant went to mediation after
    she received the refusal. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition, in this case, the letter invited the appellant to contact his counsel
    or, if he did not have counsel, to write with questions if he needed further
    information or guidance about the dispute resolution process. In <i>Smith</i>, the claimant was only invited to
    contact the insurer if she disagreed with the assessment. She was told she had
    the right to ask the Ontario Insurance Commission for mediation and was
    provided with the Commission’s contact information.The insurer did not offer to
    further clarify the process.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    in my view, there are significant differences between the refusal in this case
    and that in <i>Smith</i>.  The refusal in this case specifically referred
    to the dispute resolution process.  It
    enclosed copies of the relevant sections of the <i>Act</i>.  In addition, the refusal
    referred to the earlier mediations.  It made
    a reasonable assumption that the appellant knew about the dispute resolution
    process and it invited inquiries if he did not. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    am satisfied that the refusal in this case, standing alone, is sufficient to
    meet the consumer protection purpose that formed the rationale for the majority
    decision in <i>Smith</i>.  The underpinning of the rationale is the need
    to ensure that an insured is properly informed about the dispute resolution
    process at the time an insurer refuses to pay benefits.  The refusal in this case meets that
    standard.    </span></p>

    reaching this conclusion, I do not find it necessary to have regard to
    circumstances not contained in the respondent’s letter of January 23, 2000.  Importantly, it is the letter that makes what
    I find to be the reasonable assumption that the appellant had been informed of
    the dispute resolution process and the relevant time limits.</span></p>

    have reached the same conclusion as the motion judge but by a slightly
    different path.  The motion judge found
    that the letter, by itself, did not constitute a proper refusal to pay
    benefits.  He went on, however, to find
    that the appellant should not be able to feign ignorance of the dispute
    resolution process having regard to the fact that he was an experienced
    litigant and had been through three mediations (two under the <i>Act</i> and one private).  The motion judge noted that it would be
    unfair to the respondent to have to answer the appellant’s claims so many years
    after the accident.  While I agree with
    the result reached by the motion judge, I am satisfied that the same conclusion
    is available from the letter standing alone.  It is not necessary to go outside the letter in order to find that the
    respondent had given the appellant proper notice of its refusal to pay benefits.</span></p>

    the result, I am satisfied that the letter of January 23, 2000, constituted a proper
    refusal to pay benefits so as to trigger the running of the limitation period
    in s. 281(5).  That period expired two
    years later, long before the appellant sought to amend his statement of claim
    to include the new statutory accident benefits claims.  I agree with the motion judge that the
    appellant has not satisfied his onus of establishing special circumstances to
    relieve against the operation of the limitation period.</span></p>

    would dismiss the appeal.  I would order
    the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs fixed in the amount of $4,500,
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.</span></p>
