  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, the court must again consider the
    operation of s. 3 of the <i>Road Access Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. R.34 (the &#8220;<i>Act</i>&#8221;).</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents bought a small commercial property
    known as Healey Lake Lodge (the &#8220;Lodge property&#8221;) in 2000.&nbsp; They operate a marina/cottage resort on
    the Lodge property, in which they provide accommodation at the Lodge, rent out
    boats, lease car parking spaces to cottagers with only water access to their
    properties, and operate a small restaurant.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants own a cottage property on the west side
    of the Lodge property.&nbsp; They
    purchased their property in 1982.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Healey Lake Lodge Road is a municipal road that provides
    access to the respondents&#8217; property.&nbsp; It runs to the easterly boundary of the Lodge property and connects to a
    road and parking lot area (the &#8220;Road&#8221;) that runs across the Lodge property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For many years, the appellants used the Road to gain
    access to their cottage.&nbsp; They have
    no registered right of way, easement or other such right that would entitle
    them to such use.&nbsp; There was no
    evidence that they purchased their property in 1982 on the basis that they were
    acquiring road access or an easement over the Lodge property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approximately a year after the respondents bought the
    Lodge property, they discovered that the appellants were using the Road to gain
    access to their property.&nbsp; They suggested
    that the appellants share the cost of maintaining the Road but the appellants
    refused.&nbsp; Later, they offered to
    permit the appellants to park their vehicle at the Lodge property for the same
    modest annual fee that they charged other cottagers.&nbsp; These offers were never accepted.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown lands are located to the south of the
    appellants&#8217; and respondents&#8217; properties.&nbsp; There is a trail on the Crown lands that
    runs within about six feet of the appellants&#8217; property.&nbsp; The trail has been cut through the bush
    to enable the hydro pole line on the Crown lands to be serviced.&nbsp; The trail is very rough and while all
    terrain vehicles can use it (the &#8220;ATV trail&#8221;), standard passenger
    vehicles cannot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents and one of their neighbours, Martin
    Bracken, applied to the Ministry of Natural Resources (the
    &#8220;Ministry&#8221;) for a permit to construct a road on the
    &#8220;footprint&#8221; of the ATV trail.&nbsp; The proposed road &#8211; which would have been paid for by the
    respondents and Mr. Bracken &#8211; would have provided motor vehicle access to
    the appellants&#8217; property and neighbouring cottages.&nbsp; All of the neighbouring cottage owners
    except the appellants consented to the construction of the proposed road.&nbsp; Other necessary consents were obtained
    but, based on the appellants&#8217; <span class=GramE>opposition,</span> the
    Ministry advised that permission to construct the road would not be given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants brought an application for a declaration
    that the Road is an access road within the meaning of the <i>Act </i>and for an order preventing the respondents from obstructing
    and preventing use of the Road in any fashion.&nbsp; The respondents brought a
    counter-application in which they disputed that the Road was an access road
    but, if it were so found, they asked for an order closing the Road pursuant to
    s. 3(1) of the <i>Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice O&#8217;Neill heard the application and counter-application
    together.&nbsp; He:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found
    that the Road is an access road within the meaning of s. 1 of the <i>Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found
    that the appellants had no alternative road access to their property;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held that
    the appellants had no legal right to use the Road; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpreted
    s. 3(1) of the <i>Act </i>as leaving the
    court with a residual discretion to refuse to grant a closing order; and,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=GramE>v</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refused
    to exercise that discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, by order dated January 9, 2009 (the
    &#8220;Order&#8221;), the applications judge dismissed the application, granted
    the counter-application and made a closing order in respect of the Road.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal.&nbsp; They ask this court to set aside the
    Order and make an order providing them with access over the Road.&nbsp; They ask that the matter be returned for
    a further hearing on the merits of the closing order, with each party having
    the right to file additional evidence.&nbsp; Alternatively, the appellants ask for an order postponing closure of the
    Road for a period of two years to permit them an opportunity to establish
    alternate access arrangements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=GramE>respondents</span> cross-appeal.&nbsp; Their cross-appeal is conditional on the
    appeal being allowed.&nbsp; In such an
    event, they ask this court to find that the applications judge had no residual
    discretion to refuse to close the Road, having found that one of the conditions
    in s. 3(1) of the <i>Act </i>was satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons of the applications judge are thorough and
    compelling.&nbsp; His approach to the
    legislation is logical, sound and in accordance with this court&#8217;s
    jurisprudence. For the reasons that follow, I agree with the applications
    judge&#8217;s reasoning and result.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with the result that the
    cross-appeal falls away.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE JUDGMENT BELOW </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge found that the Road is an
    &#8220;access road&#8221; within the meaning of s. 1 of the <i>Act </i>as it is located on land not owned
    by a municipality; it is not dedicated and accepted as, or otherwise deemed at
    law to be, a public highway; and, it serves as a motor vehicle access route to
    one or more parcels of land.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge further found that there is no
    alternative road access to the appellants&#8217; land.&nbsp; He held that the existing ATV trail,
    which could arguably constitute a road, does not qualify as &#8220;alternative
    access&#8221; because, in its current condition and form, it does not reach the
    appellants&#8217; property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge then considered whether to grant
    a closing order in respect of the Road pursuant to s. 3 of the <i>Act</i>.&nbsp; Based on this court&#8217;s decision in <i>992275 Ontario Inc. v. <span class=SpellE>Krawczyk</span> </i>(2006), 268 D.L.R. (4th) 121, he began by observing that a finding that a
    road is an access road does not give the persons whose property is served by
    the Road a legal right to use it within the meaning of s. 3(1)(b) of the <i>Act</i>.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found that the appellants had no legal right to
    use the Road and, hence, that s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Act </i>was satisfied, the applications
    judge considered whether he was bound to grant the closing order.&nbsp; He rejected the respondents&#8217;
    argument that having found that a condition in s. 3(1) had been <span
class=GramE>met,</span> he was bound to close the Road.&nbsp; In his view, a judge hearing a road
    closing application under s. 3 of the <i>Act </i>retains a residual discretion to refuse to close it, even after one of the
    conditions therein has been satisfied.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge refused, however, to exercise
    that discretion.&nbsp; He gave the
    following reasons for concluding that an order should be made closing the
    Road.&nbsp; The evidence established that
    on payment of a modest annual fee and subject to some additional conditions,
    the appellants could use the Road and park within a few feet of where they
    presently park and thereby gain access to their cottage.&nbsp; Further, he viewed it as being in the
    public interest to close the Road, given the evidence of the application to the
    Ministry of Natural Resources for construction of a road over the ATV
    trail.&nbsp; He found that the weight of
    the evidence established that if the appellants consent to the construction of
    the proposed road, permission to construct that road will be granted.&nbsp; The applications judge viewed the public
    interest as being better served by proceeding in that manner, as it permits competing
    claims to be reconciled through a common application process rather than by
    making an order granting the appellants permanent access over the
    respondents&#8217; property.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue raised on appeal is whether the
    applications judge erred in making the closing order.&nbsp; The appellants make two arguments in
    this regard.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They submit that the requirements in ss. 3(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) and (b) of the <i>Act </i>are to be read conjunctively.&nbsp; Accordingly, they contend that once the appellants were found to have no
    legal right to use the Road (<i>i.e. </i>that
    the requirements in s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Act </i>were met), the applications judge
    erred in failing to consider whether the conditions in s. 3(1)(a) had also been
    met.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They submit that once the applications judge determined
    that he might grant a closing order, he erred by failing to properly balance
    the competing interests of the parties.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second issue raised on appeal is whether if the
    closing order was properly made, its operation should be postponed pursuant to
    s. 3(2) of the <span class=GramE><i>Act </i>&nbsp;to</span> permit the appellants an
    opportunity to establish alternate access arrangements. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>VALIDITY OF THE CLOSURE ORDER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Are the conditions in s. 3(1) of the Act
    conjunctive or disjunctive?</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For ease of reference, I reproduce s. 3(1) below.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>(1)<span
class=GramE>&nbsp;&nbsp;The</span> judge may grant the closing order upon being
    satisfied that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> closure of the road is reasonably necessary to prevent substantial damage or
    injury to the interests of the applicant or for some other purpose in the
    public interest; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>in</span> the case of an access road that is not a common road, persons described in
    subsection 2 (3) do not have a legal right to use the road; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) <span class=GramE>in</span> the case of a common road, the persons who use the road do not have a legal
    right to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the applications judge erred
    in granting the closing order based on having found only that the requirements
    in s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) were met.&nbsp; As I previously indicated, they argue
    that ss. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) and (b) are to be read conjunctively,
    rather than disjunctively.&nbsp; Thus,
    they say, once the applications judge found that the requirements in s. 3(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) were met, he was required to consider whether the
    requirements in s. 3(1)(a) were also met.&nbsp; On this argument, it is only if the requirements in both sections are
    met that the court has the jurisdiction to make a closing order.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In large measure, the appellants base their submission
    on their contention that unless the conditions are read conjunctively, s. 3(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) will be meaningless.&nbsp; Their argument runs as follows.&nbsp; If a person has a legal right to use an
    access road, he or she would have no need to make an application pursuant to
    the <i>Act </i>in order to enforce their
    rights.&nbsp; Thus, the <i>Act </i>will be invoked only when the person
    seeking to use an access road has no legal right to such use.&nbsp; As a result, the condition in s. 3(1)(b)
    will always be satisfied and s. 3(1)(a) will never become engaged.&nbsp; But, the argument runs, the considerations
    in s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) are important and should be part of that
    which the court takes into consideration when deciding whether to grant a closing
    order.&nbsp; This can be accomplished by
    reading the conditions conjunctively.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept that s. 3(1) is to be read
    conjunctively.&nbsp; First and most
    significantly, such an interpretation runs contrary to the wording of s. 3(1),
    in which the word &#8220;or&#8221; is used.&nbsp; On a plain reading, this indicates that
    the provisions in s. 3(1) are to be read disjunctively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, such an interpretation is inconsistent with the
    structure of s. 3(1).&nbsp; On the
    appellants&#8217; argument, after finding that the requirements of either s.
    3(1)(b) or (c) are met, the court must return to determine whether the
    requirements of s. 3(1)(a) have also been met.&nbsp; Going backwards in an application of s.
    3(1) makes little sense.&nbsp; Had the
    legislature intended to require that the conditions in s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    must be met as well as either of ss. 3(1)(b) or (c), it would have said so.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, while this court has not directly considered
    this issue previously, it has proceeded on the basis that the provisions in s.
    3(1) are disjunctive.&nbsp; In <i>Krawczyk</i>, at para. 18, the court states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, a conclusion that an order to close
    the Road should only be made in the limited circumstances referred to by the
    trial judge is patently incorrect either because the trial judge does not
    retain a residual discretion under s. 3(1) to refuse to close an access road if <i>one of the conditions in s. 3(1) is met</i>,
    or because the conclusion does not reflect the balancing necessary for the
    proper exercise of the residual discretion. &nbsp;[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>2008795
    Ontario Inc. v. Kilpatrick</i> (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 561 (C.A.) at para. 23,
    Laskin J.A. writing for the court, states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here, the record does not disclose that any of the
    cottagers has a &#8220;legal right&#8221; under s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    to use the access road over Lot 18.&nbsp; Thus, the cottagers would not seem to have a defence to an application
    to close the road.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, in <i>Blais v.
    Belanger</i> (2007), 282 D.L.R. (4th) 98 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 32, Juriansz
    J.A., writing for the court, says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 3 of the <i>Act </i>was amended, effective January 1, 2003, to provide that a judge
    may grant a closing order simply upon being satisfied that the owners or
    tenants who would be deprived of motor vehicle access to their land if the road
    were closed &#8220;do not have a legal right to use the road&#8221;. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I do not accept the premise that underlies
    this submission, namely, that only those without a legal right to use an access
    road will invoke the <i>Act</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Act</i> provides an expeditious way of resolving disputes over access roads.&nbsp; It may be that a person with a legal
    right to use an access road would find it more convenient to have access issues
    resolved through the <i>Act </i>rather than
    by an action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I do not
    see that reading the provisions in s. 3(1) disjunctively, renders s. 3(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) meaningless or redundant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, I am of the view that once the
    applications judge found that the conditions in s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    were satisfied, he was entitled to consider the closing order.&nbsp; He made no error in failing to consider
    the conditions in s. 3(1)(a), namely, whether closure of the Road was reasonably
    necessary to prevent substantial damage or injury to the respondents&#8217;
    interests or for some other purpose in the public interest within the meaning
    of s. 3(1)(a) of the <i>Act</i>. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Did the applications judge err in failing to balance
    the parties&#8217; competing interests?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that once the applications judge
    determined that he might grant a closing order, he was required to invite the
    parties to provide further evidence of the effects that such an order would
    have on their interests.&nbsp; The
    appellants say such information would include the effects such an order might
    have on them, including any loss in convenience or diminution in value of their
    property.&nbsp; Without that evidence, it
    is argued, the applications judge could not properly discharge his obligation
    to balance the competing interests of the parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission for three reasons.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the respondents&#8217; counter-application made
    it abundantly clear that a closing order was being sought.&nbsp; The applications judge was entitled to
    assume that the parties had provided the court with the information necessary
    to have that matter decided.&nbsp; It was
    not for the applications judge to second-guess counsel and adjourn the matter
    on his own motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in my view, the applications judge had
    sufficient evidence of the parties&#8217; competing interests in order to balance
    them.&nbsp; In his reasons, he recognizes
    that the appellants had a long-standing practice of using the Road, noting that
    they have used it to gain access to their property since 1982.&nbsp; Having found that the appellants had no
    alternative road access to their property, he clearly understood the effect
    that a closing order would have on them.&nbsp; However, in recognition of the appellants&#8217; need for access to
    their cottage, he identified two practical alternatives that would give them
    such access.&nbsp; The applications judge
    took into consideration the respondents&#8217; attempts to resolve the matter
    of access, including through offering the appellants the right to lease a
    parking space at a modest annual fee, as other cottagers do.&nbsp; He also considered the application to the
    Ministry in respect of the ATV trail and the fact that it could provide the
    appellants with access to their property.&nbsp; &nbsp;In light of the alternative access
    solutions available to the appellants, the applications judge was not inclined
    to exercise his discretion in a way that restricted the ownership rights of the
    respondents by making the Lodge property permanently subject to a road access
    order.&nbsp; In my view, the applications
    judge&#8217;s reasons demonstrate that he was alive to, and balanced, the
    parties&#8217; competing interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, I reject the assumption that underlies this
    argument, namely, that the exercise of discretion was limited to a
    consideration of the competing interests of the parties.&nbsp; While the parties&#8217; interests are
    relevant considerations, I see nothing in s. 3(1) (or otherwise in the <i>Ac</i>t) which limits the court to a consideration
    of only those interests.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the applications judge considered
    the process that ensued following the application to the Ministry of Natural Resources.&nbsp; He was of the view that the public
    interest was better served by having competing claims reconciled through that
    process.&nbsp; I see nothing improper in
    his having taken into consideration that public interest factor.&nbsp; Although the public interest is
    mentioned in s. 3(1)(a) but not s. 3(1)(b), that does not mean that the public
    interest can have no bearing on whether to exercise the residual discretion to
    refuse to make a closing order when s. 3(1)(b) is engaged.&nbsp; Once the court is satisfied that one of
    the requirements in s. 3(1) has been met, it has the power to grant the closing
    order.&nbsp; In determining whether to
    exercise its residual discretion and refuse to make such an order, the court must
    consider all relevant factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that this court has indicated that in
    relation to s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), the proper exercise of
    discretion requires a court to balance the parties&#8217; competing
    interests.&nbsp; At para. 18 of <i>Krawczyk</i>, the court stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assuming without deciding that a judge hearing a
    road closing application retains a residual discretion to refuse to close the
    road where one of the conditions for closing an access road set out in s. 3(1)
    is satisfied, at least in relation to s. 3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), the
    proper exercise of that discretion would require balancing the competing
    interests of the parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
    while this quotation makes it clear that the court must balance the
    parties&#8217; competing <span class=GramE>interests,</span> I do not read it
    as limiting the court solely to a consideration of those interests.&nbsp; In the circumstances of this case, the
    applications judge did not err by taking into consideration the nature of the application
    process to the Ministry and its likely result.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>POSTPONING THE OPERATION OF THE CLOSING ORDER</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge was not asked to postpone the
    operation of the closing order.&nbsp; Consequently, he cannot be faulted for failing to consider that
    possibility.&nbsp; While it is not
    appropriate to raise such a matter for the first time on appeal,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> the record is sufficient to permit a response.&nbsp; Given the alternatives available to the
    appellants that provide access to their property, as identified by the
    applications judge, there is no need to give them time to establish alternate
    access arrangements.&nbsp; Immediate
    access can be had if, like their fellow cottagers, they lease a parking space
    from the respondents.&nbsp; While the
    proposed road may not be available immediately, it too provides an alternative
    mechanism for access.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>A Concluding Comment on s. 3(1) of
    the Act</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given my conclusion, strictly speaking it may not be
    necessary to decide whether the applications judge correctly interpreted s.
    3(1) as leaving him with a residual discretion to refuse to grant the closing
    order.&nbsp; Had it been necessary to
    decide the matter, I am inclined to the same view.&nbsp; Section 3(1) provides that the judge
    &#8220;may&#8221; grant a closing order.&nbsp; It is trite law that words are to be given their plain meaning.&nbsp; The word &#8220;may&#8221; is
    permissive.&nbsp; If a judge may grant
    the closing order, the converse is also true &#8211; he or she may refuse to
    grant the closing order.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CROSS-APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of my conclusion on the main appeal, the
    cross-appeal falls away.&nbsp; </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed
