    control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was
    impaired by alcohol, contrary to s. 253(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) (“care
    or control”) and “blowing over” contrary to s. 253(1)(b).  He was acquitted at trial.  The acquittal was upheld on appeal to the
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court.  The
    Crown seeks leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals from the decision
    of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons explained below, I would grant
    leave to appeal, allow the appeal and substitute an order convicting the
    respondent on the “care or control” charge.  I would stay the “blowing over” charge.  In my view, the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge erred in law in
    that he failed to appreciate that the trial judge’s findings of fact compelled the
    legal conclusion that the respondent had care or control of the vehicle when
    arrested by the police officer.  His failure
    to convict in the face of findings of fact which unequivocally establish the
    legal elements of the offence of “care or control” constitutes reversible error.</p>

  <h2>The Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At about 2:50 a.m. on New <span class=GramE>Year’s
    day</span>, 2007, after an evening of celebrating the New Year the respondent
    left the Army Navy Club in Cornwall Ontario.  He had been drinking.  Because of
    the respondent’s inebriated state, several of his friends encouraged him to
    call a taxi rather than drive.  The
    respondent insisted he would drive and offered to give his friends a ride
    home.  One friend was so concerned about
    the respondent driving his motor vehicle that she called the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A police officer arrived about a minute after
    the call.  He saw one car parked in the Army
    Navy Club parking lot.  The officer saw
    the respondent scraping ice off the rear window of that motor vehicle.  The engine was running and the respondent’s fiancée
    was sitting in the front passenger’s seat.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police officer approached the respondent and
    spoke to him.  The respondent was having
    difficulty standing.  The parking lot was
    icy.  The officer also noticed other
    signs of impairment.  The officer noticed
    that there were no keys in the vehicle, so he asked the respondent to give him
    the keys.  The respondent pulled the keys
    out of his pocket and gave them to the police officer.  There was a remote starter on the key chain.  It was established at trial that the
    respondent had started the car with the remote starter.  The car could not be driven until the key was
    inserted in the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was arrested and charged with
    “care or control”.  A subsequent analysis
    of the respondent’s breath revealed blood-alcohol levels of .160 and .150.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge made the following findings of
    fact, all of which are significant on the issue of whether the Crown had proved
    that the respondent was in care or control of the vehicle:</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons, the trial judge noted factual
    distinctions between this case and various cases relied on by the Crown.  In the course of drawing those factual
    distinctions, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>... <span class=GramE>but</span> he [the respondent]
    was intercepted prior to entering the vehicle and prior to inserting the key
    into the ignition:  <i>there was no present danger but one which was arrested by reason of the
    timely intervention of the police.… Mr. Ruest was neither in the vehicle nor in
    a position to bring about any danger or harm to anyone</i> in the meaning to be
    given to the legislation.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately, in acquitting the respondent, the
    trial judge indicated that proof of care or control of the vehicle required
    “some actual evidence of risk or danger, as might occur by starting to enter
    the vehicle or by placing the key in the ignition”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, the Summary Conviction Appeal Court
    judge accepted that the trial judge had correctly held that, on his findings of
    fact, the Crown had not proved the <i>actus <span
class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence of “care or control”.  The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge
    observed that on the findings of the trial judge, the Crown had not proved the
    risk necessary to establish the <i>actus <span
class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence.  He referred to <i>The Queen v. Toews</i>,
    [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119, a leading authority on the elements of the offence of
    “care or control”.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <h2>Should Leave to Appeal be <span class=GramE>Granted</span>?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am satisfied that the issue raised by the
    Crown raises a question of law.  The
    determination of whether the facts as found by the trial judge amount in law to
    a finding that the respondent was in care or control of the motor vehicle is a<span
class=MsoCommentReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span></span>question
    of law.  As recently reiterated by the
    Supreme Court of Canada, “<span class=GramE>the</span> application of a legal
    standard to the facts of a case is a question of law”:  <i>R. v.
    Shepherd</i> (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (S.C.C.), at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel has convinced me that the question
    of law raised on this appeal has importance beyond this case.  The trial judge has applied a more
    restrictive notion of risk to the determination of whether a person is in care
    or control of a motor vehicle than has been applied by binding appellate
    authorities.  The Summary Conviction
    Appeal Court judge has specifically approved that narrower concept of risk.  Unless corrected, the error below could well
    cause jurisprudential confusion as to the elements of one of the more commonly
    prosecuted offences in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h2>The Merits</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R. v.
    Wren</i> (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 374, at p. 380, this court considered the
    prior jurisprudence, including the leading decisions from the Supreme Court of
    Canada and described the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence of “care or control” in this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]n order to establish care or control of a motor
    vehicle, the act or conduct of the accused in relation to that motor vehicle
    must be such that there is created a risk of danger, whether from putting the
    car in motion or in some other way.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Adapting the language in <i>Wren</i> to the facts of this case, the question becomes – did the
    conduct of the respondent in relation to his car create a risk that the
    respondent, while impaired, would put his car is motion and thereby create a
    danger? </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with Crown counsel’s submission that the
    respondent’s stated intention to get in his car and drive away in the immediate
    future was the paramount feature of the risk assessment to be made in this
    case.  An intention to drive the vehicle
    is not an essential element of the offence of “care or control”:  see <i>Ford
    v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 231, at pp. 248-49.  It is, however, part of the conduct of the
    accused that is relevant to the determination of whether that conduct in
    relation to the motor vehicle had created a risk of danger.  The respondent’s intention to get into the
    car and drive away, probably within seconds, had the officer not arrived certainly
    magnifies the risk that the respondent would put his car in motion and create a
    danger. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent’s car was operable, running and
    sitting in an unobstructed parking lot, and the respondent had the keys in his
    pocket.  He intended to drive away,
    presumably as soon as the window was cleared.  With respect to the decisions below, it is impossible to say on these
    findings of fact that the respondent was not in care or control of the vehicle
    as defined in <i>R. v. Wren</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Speculation as to when the respondent first assumed the necessary care
    or control of the vehicle is irrelevant to his criminal liability.  The point is that by the time the officer
    arrived and stopped the respondent from getting into his vehicle and driving
    away, the respondent had taken steps to start the vehicle and prepare for its
    immediate departure.  There was an
    obvious, significant risk that the respondent would put the car in motion and
    endanger the public.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The meaning to be given to the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence of “care or
    control” turns on the language used in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and the purpose underlying the criminal prohibition created by the
    section.  In <i>R. v. Price</i> (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 378 (N.B.S.C. (A.D.)), at p.
    384, the court observed the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The mischief sought to be prohibited by the section
    as expressed by the wording is <i>that an
    intoxicated person who is in the immediate presence of a motor vehicle with the
    means of controlling it or setting it in motion is or may be a danger to the
    public.  Even if he has no immediate
    intention of setting it in motion </i>he can at any instant determine to do so,
    because his judgment may be so impaired that he cannot foresee the possible
    consequences of his actions.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the existence of the mischief
    targeted by the “care or control” criminal prohibition is all the more obvious
    in that the respondent fully intended to get into his car and drive away.  This was not a case where liability turned on
    a possible risk that the vehicle might be started despite the driver’s
    intention not to start the vehicle.  Rather, this is a case where a driver was standing at a fully operable
    vehicle with the keys and with the intention to get in the vehicle and drive it
    away.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A proper application of the relevant law to the
    facts as found by the trial judge could yield only one result – the respondent
    was guilty on the charge of “care or control”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
    the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge dismissing the appeal and allow the
    Crown’s appeal from the acquittal.  I
    would substitute a conviction and remit the matter to the trial judge for
    sentencing.  </p>
