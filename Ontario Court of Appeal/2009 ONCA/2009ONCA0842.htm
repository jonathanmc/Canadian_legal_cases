  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, a school principal, teacher and
    secretary, appeal the judgment of Aston J. dated 27 May 2009 dismissing their
    motion to dismiss the action brought by the respondent, also a teacher, on the
    basis that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
    action.  The basis for the motion was
    that the essential character of the respondent’s action was covered by a
    collective agreement between Peel Elementary Teachers Local and Peel District
    School Board, thereby limiting the respondent to remedies under the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the motion.  He pointed out that the respondent was making
    “no claim whatsoever” against his school board.  He concluded that the respondent’s action established “a connection to
    the workplace that is peripheral but not central to the allegations and claims
    he is advancing.”  Hence the respondent’s
    action could proceed in the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the motion judge erred in
    finding that the essential character of the dispute did not arise out of the
    interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the
    collective agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  As
    a preliminary point, I observe that for the purposes of the motion and this
    appeal, the facts alleged in the statement of claim are to be accepted as
    true.  In our view, the puzzling and
    troubling events that give rise to this law suit are not anchored in the
    performance of the respondent’s duties as a teacher.  As the motion judge pointed out, this reality
    is especially confirmed by the appellants’ own conduct.  They made no attempt to invoke the collective
    agreement in their alleged dispute with the respondent.  Instead, they took initiatives in a large
    number of fora not connected to the school or the collective agreement – for
    example, their attempt to have the respondent’s former girlfriend make false
    allegations against him unrelated to his work as a teacher, the complaints to
    police, the Children’s Aid Society and the Ontario Human Rights Commission, and
    the dissemination of false information to the community at large.  In light of these activities, it does not lie
    in the appellants’ mouths to say now that the only forum for the respondent’s
    response to their conduct is the collective agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also submit that the motion judge erred
    by not ruling on their motion to strike the respondent’s affidavit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A judge need not deal with every issue raised in a
    proceeding.  Here, the motion judge did
    not rely on the affidavit in his reasons for judgment.  Moreover, the very brief affidavit traversed essentially
    the same ground as the Statement of Claim.  Accordingly, the absence of any reference to the motion to strike in the
    reasons for judgment is of no moment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to its costs which
    are fixed at $3500 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
