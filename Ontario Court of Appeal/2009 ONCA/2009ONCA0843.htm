  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The appellant appeals from the decision of
    Trotter J., dismissing his application to the court for an order compelling the
    Chief Building Official of the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    to issue a building permit. The permit was to be for a restaurant that is more
    than double the size permitted by the applicable by-law. The appellant
    contended that he enjoys a legal non-conforming use, based on the size of his
    restaurant before it was destroyed by fire in 2005. He also challenged the
    validity of several by-laws on the basis of alleged non-compliance with notice
    requirements for their passage, and the applicability of those by-laws to his
    property. Trotter J. rejected each of these assertions, finding: </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (1)       the appellant did not enjoy a legal
    non-conforming use as his restaurant was
    not the size he claimed at the time it burned down; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (2)       the relevant by laws were properly passed
    and in force; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (3)       the by-laws applied to the appellant’s
    property.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the history of this matter, Trotter J. adopted the
    recitation of the facts from the reasons of Simmons J.A., rendered in the related
    proceeding of <i>Toronto (City) v. Gallos</i>,
    2008 ONCA 617, which was a denial of leave to appeal under s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    P.33,<i> </i>for convictions in relation to
    the restaurant under s. 8(13) of the <i>Building
    Code Act</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 23 and s. 67(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He quoted from paragraphs 13 to 26 of the reasons of
    Simmons J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[13]     The
    applicant purchased his property, which is located on the north side of Queen
    Street East, east of Woodbine Avenue, in 1976. According to the applicant, in
    1976 the building on the property was set back about 35 feet from the property
    line and there was a hill in front of the building sloping upwards at an angle
    of about 60 degrees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[14]     After
    purchasing his property, the applicant continued to operate an existing
    laundromat in the basement for a year or two but then started work on
    developing the basement for use as a family restaurant. By the end of 1985, the
    applicant had exposed the basement by removing the earth in front of the
    building and had also excavated a portion of the basement to make it deeper. In
    addition, he had lengthened the building by constructing a new front wall about
    seven or eight feet out from the original building and had built a first-floor
    veranda and steps up to the first floor. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[15]     The
    applicant obtained a permit to build a restaurant on his property on May 31,
    1989.&nbsp; At that time, By-law 438-86, as amended by By-law 69-87,
    established a size restriction for restaurants in the Beaches of 165 square
    metres of gross floor area. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[16]     There
    was no dispute on this application that the general definition of “gross floor
    area” in By-law 438-86, as it applied to the applicant’s restaurant on May 31,
    1989, did not include below grade space: see Appendix “A” for the text of the
    relevant by-laws. However, on June 1, 1989, the day after the applicant
    obtained his original building permit, the City passed amending By-law 361-89. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[17]     Among
    other things, amending By-law 361-89 changed the applicable size restriction
    for the applicant’s restaurant from 165 square metres of “gross floor area” to
    165 square metres of “non-residential gross floor area”. Subject to certain
    exclusions, the general definition of “non-residential gross floor area” in
    By-law 438-86, as it applied to the applicant’s restaurant, included below
    grade space: see Appendix “A”. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[18]     In
    1994, the applicant decided to renovate the first-floor veranda to make the
    front of his building more aesthetically pleasing. He demolished the front of
    the building, including the front stairway; moved the stairs to the other side
    of the building; extended the first-floor veranda; and extended the front wall
    of the bottom floor restaurant to match the first-floor extension, thereby
    increasing the size of the restaurant. According to the applicant, all of this
    work was completed under building permit #366550. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19]     On
    May 28, 1996, the applicant obtained building permit #383446, allowing him to
    expand his restaurant upstairs. In order to grant this permit, Mr. Mathewson, a
    plans examiner for the City, had to determine that the additional space would
    not cause the applicant’s restaurant to exceed the 165 square metres size
    limit. Although building permit #383446 was later revoked, Mr. Mathewson
    testified that he was able to grant the extra space to the applicant by
    classifying the kitchen as a below grade accessory use to the restaurant. Prior
    to July 2, 1996, below grade accessory uses were not included in the
    calculation of non-residential gross floor area. As accessory use was not
    defined in the by-law, plans examiners had discretion to determine whether a
    particular use was properly considered to be accessory.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='color:blue'>[2]</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20]     Mr.
    Mathewson indicated that he excluded the kitchen from the 165 square metre size
    limit by classifying the kitchen as “basically mechanical space” and therefore
    as an accessory use. He confirmed that the plans filed for building permit
    #383446 showed a step down to the kitchen and therefore that the kitchen was
    below grade at the time. He also confirmed that the front doors of the
    restaurant were in their pre-building permit #400567 location, and that with
    the kitchen excluded, the restaurant area was less than 165 square metres. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[21]     Mr.
    Mathewson acknowledged that his interpretation was “stretching things” but
    explained that the applicant seemed “fairly desperate”, that he [Mr. Mathewson]
    “felt maybe [he] should help [the applicant]”, and that it was not a large
    space on the second floor. In re-examination, Mr. Mathewson confirmed that
    rather than being an accessory use, a kitchen is generally considered an
    essential part of a restaurant. He also confirmed that his interpretation was subsequently
    overruled.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[22]     On
    July 2, 1996, the City passed amending By-law 1996-0332. Among other things,
    this by-law added a new definition of “non-residential gross floor area” to the
    section of By-law 438-86 that creates the size restriction for restaurants in
    the Beaches. This definition omitted the exclusion for accessory uses, electing
    instead to specify the particular uses that were to be excluded from the
    calculation of non-residential gross floor area.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>In addition, this definition deleted an exclusion
    for below grade space used for a permitted non-residential purpose as of
    January 31, 1976. This deletion closed a perceived loophole created by By-law
    361-89 that may have allowed building owners to create large restaurants by
    expanding into below grade space formerly used for commercial purposes: see
    Appendix “A”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[23]     On
    December 12, 1996, city officials convened a meeting with the applicant to
    discuss issues concerning the size of his restaurant. By letter dated January
    23, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Coburn, the chief building official at the time, revoked
    building permit #383446 under s. 8(10)(d) of the <i>Building Code Act</i>,
    stating that the permit “was issued in error.” </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[24]     On
    April 6, 1997, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission decided that the applicant
    could expand the licensed capacity of his restaurant provided that he satisfied
    certain conditions, one of which was to obtain a compliance letter from the
    City of Toronto Building Department. The Building Department declined to issue
    a compliance letter because they claimed that, under By-law 438-86, as amended,
    the applicant’s restaurant exceeded the permissible non-residential gross floor
    area. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[25]     On
    July 11, 1997, the City issued building permit #400567 to permit the applicant
    to move the front doors of the restaurant and perform certain other work to
    achieve the necessary size reduction. The building permit application was dated
    July 7, 1997 and bore the signature “William Gallos”, as well as the signature
    of a Building Department witness. The application was accompanied by a plan
    prepared by Delta Engineering dated June 30, 1997 (the “Delta Engineering
    Plan”) containing some printed calculations concerning the dimensions of the
    restaurant. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[26]     The
    applicant obtained his new liquor licence on August 17, 1997, after the City
    issued a compliance letter. In late September or early October 1997, the
    applicant returned the front doors to their original location. The City laid
    charges against the applicant on October 3, 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of these charges, obtained
    a new trial on appeal, but was convicted again in 2003. His appeal of that
    conviction was dismissed and leave to appeal from the dismissal was denied by Simmons
    J.A. on September 11, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The restaurant burned down on May 8, 2005 and on March
    20, 2006, the appellant applied for a building permit to re-construct his
    previous building. This was permitted by clause 12(1)(3)(b) of by-law 438-86 as
    long as what was previously there had been lawful. The permit application was
    for a building that included a restaurant of 334.63 square metres of
    non-residential gross floor area. Sean Fitzpatrick, a zoning/building plans
    examiner for the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    issued an examiner’s notice to the appellant advising that the proposed
    restaurant exceeded the permitted 165 square metres of non-residential gross
    floor area. His affidavit evidence, which the application judge accepted, was
    that he had reviewed every permit that the appellant had applied for since 1989,
    and the appellant had only ever received approval for a restaurant of less than
    165 square metres at his property location. Mr. Fitzpatrick’s evidence was that
    the City was prepared to issue a permit for a restaurant of 165 square metres
    or less on the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 30, 2006 the Committee of Adjustments refused
    the appellant a variance to build a restaurant larger than 165 square metres.
    The Ontario Municipal Board dismissed an appeal from that refusal. It stated
    that it was not satisfied, based on the evidence presented by the appellant,
    that he ever had a restaurant in excess of 165 square metres or that a building
    permit had been given to permit that space.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position and evidence on the application
    was that before the fire in 2005, he operated a restaurant that exceeded 165
    square metres and that he therefore enjoyed a legal non-conforming use. The
    City’s position was that, although at one point the appellant’s restaurant had
    exceeded 165 square metres, he reduced the size to comply with the by-law, in order
    to obtain approval for the liquor license. When Mr. Gallos reduced the size of
    his restaurant, he gave up any legal non-conforming use that he may have had.
    Accordingly, when he then increased the size of his restaurant after obtaining
    the liquor license, he was found to be in contravention of the <i>Building Code Act </i>and the <i>Planning Act</i>. Trotter J. first addressed
    the standard of review to be applied on review of a decision of the City to
    deny a building permit. He concluded that his function was similar to that of a
    judge on an appeal under s. 25 of the <i>Building
    Code Act</i> regarding the issuance of a building permit, and adopted the
    standard of review set out by Ducharme J. in <i>1218897 Ontario Ltd. (c.o.b.) Castle Auto Collision and Mechanical
    Service) v. Toronto (City) Chief Building Official </i>(2005), 14 M.P.L.R. (4th)
    217 (Ont. S.C.J.) at para. 5: a standard close to correctness on issues of law,
    and a standard of reasonableness on findings of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He concluded that the City’s decision was largely one
    of fact and on that basis was entitled to great deference. He accepted the
    evidence of Mr. Fitzpatrick, based on his review of the appellant’s previous
    building permit applications, that the appellant was never given permission to
    build a restaurant larger than 165 square metres and that the property did not
    exceed that size before it burned down. The application judge rejected the
    appellant’s evidence to the contrary. He found that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On all of the evidence, I am unable to conclude
    that Mr. Fitzpatrick was unreasonable or wrong in concluding that the permit
    that was requested should not be issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the application judge found that the appellant
    had not established on a balance of probabilities based on the evidence on the
    application, that he enjoyed a legal non-conforming use. <i>Rotstein v. Oro-Medonte (Township)</i> (2002), 34 M.P.L.R. (3d) 266 (Ont.
    S.C.J.) In that regard he adopted the reasoning of Simmons J.A. at para. 70 of
    her reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[70]     The <i>Planning
    Act</i> grants protection to legal non-conforming uses, but only if the land,
    building or structure in question continues to be used for that purpose: <i>Planning
    Act</i>, s. 34(9)(a). Even assuming that the applicant was entitled to a legal
    non-conforming use entitling him to a restaurant larger than 165 square metres
    of non-residential gross floor area at some point, he discontinued that use
    when he moved the doors of his restaurant inward so the City would issue a
    compliance letter. In these circumstances, I fail to see any available argument
    that the provincial offences appeal court judge erred in holding that the
    applicant lost any legal non-conforming use to which he may otherwise have been
    entitled when he moved the doors of his restaurant to bring it into compliance
    with the then current by-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He summarized his finding as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the record before me, I have concluded that Mr.
    Gallos has not established an actual legal right to a restaurant in excess of
    165 square metres prior to when it burned down.&nbsp; Moreover, I am satisfied
    that any claim to a legal non-conforming use was extinguished in August of 1997
    when Mr. Gallos reduced the size of his restaurant.&nbsp; In reaching this last
    conclusion, I completely <i>adopt</i> the persuasive reasoning of Simmons J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also challenged the validity of three
    by-laws: 69-87, 361-89 and 1996-0332 as having been passed in contravention of
    s. 34(12) of the <i>Planning Act</i> because
    he did not receive notice of the proposal of these by-laws. Although Trotter J.
    expressed the view that it was not really necessary to examine the validity of
    the by-laws.  he went on to address this
    issue.  He relied on the notations in the
    Reports of the Land Use Committee relating to all three challenged by<i>-</i>laws, each<i> </i>of which was adopted by Toronto City Council. The Reports
    indicated that notice of public meeting was given as required by the <i>Planning Act</i>, and that a public meeting
    had been held. They also provided a list of the persons who had addressed the
    Committee. Although the notices themselves had not been found, Trotter J.
    concluded on a balance of probabilities that the City had demonstrated that the
    notice and public meeting requirements of the Act had been complied with. He
    also noted that the appellant did not appeal any of the impugned by-laws to the
    Ontario Municipal Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trotter J. also addressed a further issue raised by the
    appellant respecting by-law 361-89. The appellant asserted that an amendment
    following the public meeting was made without notice. However, in accordance
    with s. 34(17) of the<i> Planning Act</i>, the
    Council adopted the recommendation of the City solicitor that no further notice
    be given. Trotter J. concluded that he was satisfied on the record, referring
    to <i>Scozzafava v. St. Catharines (City)</i> (2007), 34 M.P.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 189 at 191-192 (Ont. C.A.), that the City
    had carried out its obligations under the statute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Trotter J. held that there was no basis either
    procedurally or substantively for an award of damages, claimed in the amount of
    $35,000,000, and dismissed that claim.</p>
  <h3>Issues on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his Notice of Appeal, the appellant asks this court
    to overturn the findings of fact and conclusions of law of Trotter J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s main point relates to the question
    whether his restaurant still exceeded 165 square metres after he reduced its
    size to obtain the liquor license, and whether he had a legal non-conforming
    use. He was also concerned that the definition of “gross floor area” in the
    1996 by-law was ambiguous.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with the appellant’s arguments on appeal
    is that they take issue with findings of fact made by Trotter J.; however, the appellant
    did not point to a palpable and overriding error made by Trotter J. in his
    apprehension of the evidence or in his conclusions based on that evidence.
    Therefore, there is no basis to interfere with any of his findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trotter J. made three findings of fact that were determinative
    of the issues of legal non-conforming use and whether the appellant was
    entitled to a building permit for the non-complying premises. First, he found
    that the restaurant did not exceed 165 square metres at the time just prior to
    when it burned down in 2005 and accordingly that the appellant does not have a
    legal non-conforming use on this basis. Second, Trotter J. found that even if
    the appellant had a legal non-conforming use at some point, he lost it in
    October 1997, when he reduced the size of his restaurant to comply with the new
    1996 by-law in order to obtain a new liquor license. Finally, he found that the
    appellant was never granted a permit that allowed the restaurant to exceed 165
    square metres and, as a result, the appellant had not established an “actual
    legal right” to a restaurant in excess of 165 square metres. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant argued that these findings
    were in error and that the inspector’s evidence was that the restaurant was still
    in excess of 165 square metres after the appellant reduced its size to obtain
    the liquor license. The court called on counsel for the respondent to respond
    on that issue. Counsel explained that building inspectors had measured the
    restaurant after the appellant reduced its size. They determined that it was
    less than 165 square metres, and as a result, the appellant was able to obtain
    the liquor license. This evidence came from the cross-examination of a building
    inspector who had participated in this inspection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This evidence answers the appellant’s suggestion that
    the restaurant was still in excess of 165 square metres at the time he received
    the liquor license. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, having obtained the liquor license by virtue
    of the finding that the restaurant had been reduced to compliance, the
    appellant cannot now argue that an alleged ambiguity in the definition of the “non-residential
    gross floor area” in the 1996 by-law undermines that finding. The appellant
    also raises as an error of law, that Trotter J. relied on the evidence of
    notice of the three impugned by laws when the actual notices were not found.
    This was not an error. The application judge, as the trier of fact, is entitled
    to accept evidence that he is satisfied is reliable. In this case, the recitation
    in an official document that notice was given can be accepted as such evidence.
    Furthermore, the fact that notice was given was further substantiated by the
    fact that members of the public appeared at the meeting and asked questions.
    The application judge made no error on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sought to introduce two kinds of fresh
    evidence on this appeal. First, an affidavit of Richard Stockford, who states
    that he is another restaurant operator in the Beach area of Toronto. In his
    affidavit, Mr. Stockford states that he, like the appellant, never received
    notice of the passing of by-law 1996-0332. Second, the appellant sought to
    introduce by-law 35-76, which amended by-law 20623 in 1976. The appellant
    wanted to use by-law 35-76 to challenge the validity of by-law 69-87.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
    diligence, it could have been adduced at trial: <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.<i> </i>Both the affidavit of Mr. Stockford and the text of by-law 34-76 could
    have been put before the application judge in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs
    fixed at $2,500 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
