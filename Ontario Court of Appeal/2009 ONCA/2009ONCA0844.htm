  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following his pleas of guilty and subsequent
    convictions on two counts of aggravated sexual assault and two counts of
    choking to enable the commission of aggravated sexual assault, a 16-day sentencing
    hearing was held to determine whether the respondent should be declared either
    a dangerous or a long-term offender. The trial judge declared the respondent to
    be a long-term offender and imposed a determinate sentence of 14 years and 8
    months together with 10 years supervision in the community. The Crown appeals
    the sentence, and asks this court to find that the respondent is a dangerous
    offender, or order a new hearing. </p>
  <h3>FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent had a serious criminal
    record for four sexually-motivated offences prior to his guilty pleas on the
    predicate offences for which he was sentenced as a long-term offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      When he was 19 years old, he pled guilty
    to sexual assault on his seven year old female cousin.  He had inserted his finger into her vagina
    and forced her to perform oral sex on him. At the same time he pled guilty to
    aggravated sexual assault on his 31 year-old female cousin. He raped her, having
    made a bet with another man that he could have sex with her. As she refused sex
    with him, he punched her in the head and face, broke a beer bottle on her face
    and held a kitchen knife to her throat, threatening to kill her if she did not
    pull down her pants. The pre-sentence report for the aggravated sexual assault
    conviction showed that the respondent had indicated that he derived excitement
    and gratification in degrading and terrorizing his victims. He was sentenced
    to a total of eight years for the two offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      While in custody for these two offences,
    the respondent committed two assaults on female staff members. In 1998, while
    incarcerated in the Saskatoon Regional Psychiatric Centre, he tried to push a
    female staff member back into the washroom as she was leaving it. He pled
    guilty to assault and admitted that he had intended to have sex with her. He
    received a sentence of six months consecutive to the time he was serving
    already. In 2002, in the Kingston Regional Treatment Centre, the respondent
    again grabbed a female corrections officer and forced her into a washroom,
    telling her to shut up. When she screamed for help, he released her and ran. He
    pled guilty to forcible confinement and assaulting a peace officer and received
    a sentence of 12 months consecutive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent served his entire sentence for
    these four previous offences of almost ten years to warrant expiry. Seven
    months after his release, he committed the predicate offences: two violent
    sexual assaults within nine days on two women, one a sex trade worker and the
    other a woman who told the respondent that she was a former sex trade worker.
    In the first incident, the respondent approached the woman and asked for a blow
    job. She said she was finished for the night, but for $20 she would take him
    to another woman. On the way, he strangled her from behind with a cloth belt,
    violently choking her, and forced her to perform oral sex and have vaginal
    intercourse. In the second incident, nine days later, he asked a woman if she
    was working the streets. She told him that she was no longer in the business
    and was going for a coffee. He joined her, and on the way, he punched her in
    the face causing her nose to bleed, then wrapped a bandana around her neck and
    violently choked her. When she continued to struggle, he threatened her with
    something in his back pocket. Fearing for her life, she allowed him to have
    vaginal sex with her from behind. He refused to use a condom. The respondent
    pled guilty to both offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent has a troubled personal
    history. His parents were both alcoholics. His mother is of aboriginal descent.
    At age three, he went to live with his aunt and uncle who raised him. He had
    weekend visits with his biological father, D.M., who sexually abused him. D.M. was
    convicted of sexually abusing the respondent and his cousin and was
    incarcerated for those offences. The respondent was a poor student, frequently
    in trouble at school. He quit school after being expelled in grade 11. He
    completed no high school credits while incarcerated due to poor attendance and
    suspensions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent also has an extensive
    institutional history that the trial judge described in detail in her reasons.
    Essentially, the respondent experienced significant difficulties participating
    in programs including educational, occupational and therapeutic. In particular,
    he had difficulty participating in the sex offender treatment program because
    of his problems with comprehension of the material. For example, in 1998 when
    he was in the sex offender treatment program at the Regional Treatment Centre (Prairies),
    he had difficulty with comprehension but participated to the best of his
    ability. As a result of his cognitive deficits, a program was tailored
    specifically to his needs. Nevertheless, it was during this program that he
    attempted to take a female staff person hostage, he engaged in consensual sex
    with other inmates, masturbated and exposed himself to staff and had outbursts
    of temper. He was discharged from the program because of his attack on the
    staff member.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      From 2000 to 2002 at the Kingston
    Penitentiary, the respondent received individual counselling from a staff
    member with the sex offender program for the purpose of developing coping
    mechanisms for his sexual behaviour and to prepare for the high-intensity sex
    offender treatment program at the Regional Treatment Center in Ontario. He
    transferred there in February 2002 and began the high intensity program on July
    10. He was discharged after eight sessions when he assaulted a female staff
    member. He explained the attack as motivated by his desire to get off the unit.
    Since he had twice re-offended while undergoing treatment, it was felt that
    future treatment opportunities would be limited and at that time,
    anti-androgenic drug treatment was recommended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent was transferred to the
    special handling unit in Quebec in December 2002, where he began another
    program, but dropped out in January 2003. From November 2003 to May 2004, he
    was treated twice a day with <span class=SpellE>Androcur</span>, a sex-drive
    reducing medication. It was reported at the time that he stopped taking it
    because of weakness, fatigue and lethargy. However, he told both psychiatrists
    who assessed him for these sentencing proceedings, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> and Dr. <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Gojer</span></span><span
class=GramE>, that</span> he stopped because he was growing breasts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His warrant expiry was November 2004.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was almost 29 years old when he was
    released into the community in November 2004. He voluntarily entered into <span
class=GramE>a</span> s. 810.2 recognizance for 12 months. He came to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto to live with his
    father, the man who had gone to jail for abusing him as a child. D.M. was involved
    with a federally funded volunteer organization, Circles of Support and
    Accountability, whose mandate is to provide community support for sexual
    offenders. Through his father, the respondent also became involved with this organization,
    which monitored the relationship between the two men. It also helped to find the
    respondent a job and affordable housing to live on his own and arranged for
    counselling with a psychologist. The respondent participated in their
    fellowship work and did volunteer work himself. However, he was also using
    drugs and alcohol. While under the s. 810.2 recognizance and in spite of his
    involvement with the Circle organization, he committed the predicate offences.</p>
  <h3>REASONS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judges reasons are lengthy and
    detailed. She reviews and summarizes the evidence of all of the witnesses. The
    Crown called Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>, a forensic psychiatrist who
    conducted an assessment of the respondent for the purpose of the hearing and
    provided both a written report and oral testimony. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> reviewed all of the respondents history including his entire record from the
    penitentiary. She also interviewed him for the assessment. Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaws</span> opinion was that the respondent represented a
    high risk to re-offend and that while there are possible risk-reducing
    strategies, there are no clear treatment interventions that would render his
    risk assumable in the community, or result in eventual control with a period of
    up to ten years of supervision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence called a number of medical expert witnesses
    as well as the respondent himself. Dr. Barry Stanley was called as an expert in <span class=SpellE>Fetal</span> Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). He did not
    assess the respondent personally but gave evidence about FASD. He testified
    that although FASD cannot be cured, to respond to symptoms cognitive therapy
    and drugs are used, including Ritalin for attention deficit issues, specific
    serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for mood issues and anti-psychotics for
    mood and cognitive stabilization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Nathan Pollock is a clinical psychologist who was
    accepted as an expert in <span class=SpellE>neuro</span>-psychological tests.
    He tested the respondent and interpreted tests administered by Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>. The trial judge described his conclusions
    regarding the respondents significant cognitive limitations and their
    consistency with FASD as follows at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 136: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Pollock concluded that cognitive testing
    indicates that Mr.&nbsp;[M.] has very modest intellectual abilities, problems
    with attention, difficulties with immediate and delayed memory and a tendency
    to become cognitively distracted and disorganized under stress. His findings of
    substantial cognitive impairment are consistent with the cognitive limitations
    reported with those with FASD. He noted that FASD is associated with
    intellectual limitations, attention deficit, learning and memory problems and
    impairment in language and motor abilities. As well, those with FASD tend to
    show slower processing speed and efficiently, particularly when cognitive tasks
    involve working memory. Impaired executive functioning, characterized by
    perseveration, cognitive inflexibility, distractibility and impulsivity, are
    also commonly associated with FASD. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She also referred to his evidence that if the
    respondent were to receive sex offender treatment, it would have to be
    simplified for him and the treatment would have to be intensive and lengthy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Brenda <span class=SpellE>Stade</span> has a
    Masters in Nursing and a PhD in medical science. She leads the <span
class=SpellE>Fetal</span> Alcohol Spectrum Disorder clinic at St Michaels
    hospital. She was accepted as an expert in the diagnosis of FASD. She assessed
    the respondent and based on his history of prenatal exposure to alcohol, his <span
class=SpellE>neuro</span>-psychological profile, and the fact that he has two
    of the three indicative facial features, she concluded that he has Partial <span
class=SpellE>Fetal</span> Alcohol Syndrome (PFAS).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> was the
    psychiatrist who assessed the respondent for the defence. Based on his clinical
    interview of the respondent, together with the results of the cognitive tests
    performed by Dr. Pollock, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojers</span> diagnosis was
    personality disorder with anti-social traits. From the respondents history and
    criminal offending, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> found that he has
    multiple <span class=SpellE>paraphilias</span>, i.e. sexual deviations. He
    concluded that the respondent has FASD that has interfered with his learning
    ability, and caused attention deficit disorder, impulsivity and anger control
    problems. He also has a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Gojer</span> concluded that: The associated presence of brain
    damage increases <span class=SpellE>disinhibition</span> of sexual urges and
    the concomitant use of alcohol or drugs adds to this <span class=SpellE>disinhibition</span>.
    Clinical evaluation places him at the high risk for reoffending and does not
    negate the actuarial test findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>, Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Gojer</span> believed that the respondent could receive treatment
    that would lower his risk. He had told Mr. M. that the breast enlargement
    caused by the anti-androgen drugs could be surgically treated. He understood
    that on that basis, the respondent was willing to consider taking the drugs
    again. Mr. M. also testified at the hearing and told the sentencing judge that
    he was willing to take those drugs again and she accepted his evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> identified other
    drugs that the respondent should take and had not yet taken, such as Ritalin
    for his attention deficit disorder, anti-psychotic drugs such as SSRIs for his
    impulsive behaviours and <span class=SpellE>antabuse</span>, a chemical
    deterrent to alcohol use. He said that these problems, which he believes are
    related to the FAS, are all modifiable with drug treatment. The respondent
    would require special therapy to address his cognitive distortions toward
    sexual offending against women, particularly prostitutes, as well as individual
    counselling regarding self esteem, organization, attention problems, social
    skills and anger management.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> also discussed the
    burn-out factor which relates to the reduction in testosterone production at
    age 45, and the drop in sexual offending against adult women by offenders
    between the ages of 40 and 60 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge summarized Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojers</span> opinion as follows at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 165 and 166:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on his assessment of Mr. [M.], his
    willingness to participate in treatment including anti-androgen drugs, together
    with his age specific inevitability, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> concluded from a psychiatric perspective that there is a reasonable possibility
    of control in the community.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> said that from
    a therapy perspective he should receive anywhere from 4 to 5 years of treatment
    independent of the nature of the crime. Based on the burn-out theory, he
    suggested that Mr. [M.] should be on the Long Term Offender designation to his
    late 40s or 50s. He suggested that his sentence be approached this way: 5 to
    6 years in jail to age 37 or 38 plus 10 years as LTO would take him past the
    age of 45 which is the point where, whether he is on anti-androgen or not, he
    is more likely to be managed in the community</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge also referred to some of the
    challenges by Crown counsel to Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> in cross-examination,
    including whether his opinion regarding treatability was reasonable or just a
    hope. She quoted his response from the end of his cross-examination at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 171:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. Sweeney asked if it was his opinion that there
    is a reasonable possibility that Mr. [M.] could be treated or was he just being
    hopeful. His answer was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>No. Im basing it on clinical opinion. Im not
    making a legal opinion. I mean, we use terminologies like reasonable,
    possibility, which have legal meaning. If I had to translate that into a
    clinical sense, I would say there are clinical issues that this man has that
    can certainly be modified, if not cured. I focus on the modification process.
    There are clinical issues that this man has that can be dealt with to such a degree
    that whatever risk he poses can be reduced to a low level. There are clinical
    factors like age that would continue to decrease his risk as he gets older. His
    risk will keep reducing, unlike the static risk assessment instruments.
    Clinically his risk will keep decreasing. So the additional component is the
    legal component, how that is combined and what kind of sentence of
    incarceration if he were to be released which would then take age into account
    also. So sometimes its difficult to translate clinical concepts into legal
    concepts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence also called witnesses from the Circles of
    Support and Accountability to discuss what services they could offer the
    respondent if he were released into the community. This evidence was
    particularly important because they had had an ad hoc support role with him
    when he was released in 1998 and eventually committed the two predicate
    offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The witnesses described the program where it is
    instituted formally with an offender who is about to be released, usually at warrant
    expiry. Members of the program come to the institution several months before
    release, have access to the offenders records, and develop a plan including a
    contact person and others who will walk with the offender, both literally and
    figuratively, while the offender re-integrates into society. The Circle is
    faith based, in conjunction with the Mennonite Church and is part of the
    Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) of Ontario. The Circle provides assistance in
    finding accommodation, a job, developing a social life, banking issues, and
    generally trying to keep the person busy and away from the temptation to turn
    to alcohol and drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Circle also works with long term offenders. They
    provide psychologists and job training programs. They operate a sex offender
    treatment program as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The witnesses explained that they intervened with the
    respondent because they were working with his father and were concerned about
    him moving back in with his father. He did volunteer work at their Thrift store
    and church. They wanted him to volunteer at the Sunday school but he knew he
    couldnt because of his s. 810 order and discussed that with one of the Circle
    workers. He also met with one of their psychologists several times. He had a
    job, but lost it, then went on welfare. He began to use alcohol contrary to his
    s. 810 order and confessed this to the Circle. He showed up to the Circle
    consistently, except the night before he was arrested. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The witness who was the co-ordinator of the
    respondents circle continued to visit him in the Don Jail during this process.
    She was extremely disappointed and horrified about his arrest. He confessed
    the two offences to her and they both cried.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She explained that had the respondent been processed
    formally from the outset as a core member himself, they would have organized
    their approach differently, focusing on counselling, and ensuring that he did
    not live in an area with drugs and prostitutes. She told the court that the
    respondent would be welcomed as a core member of the Circle if he were a
    long-term offender and his re-integration would be more gradual with a more
    comprehensive plan in place for him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge concluded that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Had the MCC (Mennonite Central Committee) been
    afforded the opportunity to do the job in accordance with their usual protocol
    and had Wayne not lost the job at that critical time, his risk of reoffending
    would have been lower.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She also accepted that the Circle would be willing to
    continue to be engaged with the respondent as a long term offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was very impressed with the
    respondents own testimony before her. She noted that many of the
    manifestations of FASD as described in the evidence of the experts were
    manifested during the respondents testimony. She did not have the impression
    that he was lying. She agreed with defence counsel that the weaknesses in his
    evidence  including lack of memory and of remorse  were probably due to the
    normal passage of time and the consequences of the PFAS. She concluded that he
    was authentic and doing his best to tell the truth. She found that for his
    intellectual level, he knows what he did was wrong. Most importantly, although
    Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaws</span> opinion was that he was motivated to
    obtain his freedom, not to change, the sentencing judge concluded, based on all
    of the evidence: While recognizing its frailties, I accept his evidence that
    he will do the best he can to seek out help, to take medications, and to follow
    the rules.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge also reviewed the victim impact
    statements, which discussed the severity of the attacks and the permanent
    damage caused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the evidence in detail and making the
    findings I have identified, the sentencing judge went on to assess the issue under
    ss. 753(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) and 753.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, whether the respondent qualified as a dangerous
    offender, and whether there was a reasonable possibility of his eventual
    control in the community, requiring her to rather impose long term offender
    status. Sections 753(1)(b) and 753.1(1) provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=noarticlepara1><span style='color:black'>753.</span></span><span style='color:black'> (1) On application made under this Part after an assessment
    report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the offender to
    be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>(<i>b</i>)
    that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious
    personal injury offence described in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the definition of
    that expression in section 752 and the offender, by his or her conduct in any
    sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for
    which he or she has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his or her
    sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other
    persons through failure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=noarticlepara1><span style='color:black'>753.1</span></span><span style='color:black'> (1) The court may, on application made under this Part following
    the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find an offender
    to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>(<i>a</i>) <span class=GramE>it</span> would be appropriate to impose a sentence of
    imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which the offender has
    been convicted;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>(<i>b</i>) <span class=GramE>there</span> is a substantial risk that the offender will
    reoffend; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:black'>(<i>c</i>) <span class=GramE>there</span> is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She first dealt with the issue whether the respondent
    is also a pedophile, having attacked his child cousin, because that designation
    would reduce the applicability of the burn-out theory, which is more pertinent
    to those who attack adult women than those who attack children. She concluded
    that for the purposes of the sentencing hearing, the diagnosis of pedophilia
    was unclear, and on that basis she would not consider him a pedophile for this
    purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge found that she preferred the
    evidence of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> over that of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>. Although both were well-qualified, Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> thought it was unlikely that the respondent has
    PFAS and therefore that diagnosis did not figure into her assessment of the
    respondents treatability and eventual control in the community. The sentencing
    judge found that: In my view, the recent diagnosis of PFAS is relevant to
    treatability and eventual control and therefore relevant to establishing a fit
    and just sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conducting the statutory analysis, the trial judge
    first confirmed that the respondent met all the criteria for a dangerous
    offender designation under s. 753(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) and, in
    particular, that he is at high risk of re-offending sexually and violently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the criteria for the long-term offender
    designation, it was clear that the predicate offences would attract a
    multi-year sentence  the defence was asking for 8 to 12 years. Therefore the
    two year minimum threshold was met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The big issue for the court was the treatability of the
    respondent. The sentencing judge concluded that he is treatable. She attributed
    his lack of success with sex offender treatment programs in the past to his
    undiagnosed and untreated FASD. She accepted his evidence that he is now
    willing to try the anti-androgen drugs again in anticipation of a release date
    from the penitentiary. She found that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. [M.] is highly motivated to assure me that he
    is committed to treatment. I have accepted his evidence that he is older <span
class=GramE>now,</span> he has learned that he must be treated because he is a
    danger to others, and he is committed to treatment. Whether he follows through
    with that commitment is a function of his abilities and the resources that are
    made available to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge also relied on the fact that the
    respondents FASD had been untreated and that its effects can be managed with
    drugs that he has not yet tried. In the community, the evidence of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Stade</span> was that there is an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario program that would provide regular
    income to the respondent of about $1000 per month and this would alleviate some
    of his financial stresses so that he could focus on compliance issues. Finally
    he would have a relationship with the Circle organization. Specifically, the
    sentencing judge found that the evidence is more than mere speculative hope that the respondent is treatable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge referred to this courts decision
    in <i>R. v. G.L.</i> (2007),<i> </i>87 O.R. (3d) 683, where the court
    stated that for a long term offender, the sentencing court requires evidence
    that the offender could be meaningfully treated within a definite period of
    time and that the resources required to implement the necessary supervision
    conditions for eventual control in the community were available.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing first with the resource issue, the sentencing
    judge referred to the conditions that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> said would be necessary if the court were to consider a long term offender
    designation. She assumed that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> would not
    have identified conditions for which resources were not available. The
    conditions that were ultimately imposed were specified by respondents counsel
    and were consistent with what was suggested by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>.
    The sentencing judge noted that they were not the type of unacceptable
    conditions as were imposed in <i>G.L.</i>,
    such as almost 24 hour surveillance by experts or residence in a community
    correctional center for a protracted period of time, when such residencies are
    statutorily limited to 90 days.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her conclusion, the sentencing judge stated that
    there was evidence that the respondent can be meaningfully treated within a
    definite period of time, that the resources needed to supervise him in the
    community are available and that the long- term sentence sanction will be
    sufficient to reduce the threat he poses to an acceptable level.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the sentencing judge addressed as an issue
    separate from whether to declare the respondent a long-term offender, her
    exercise of discretion whether to make a dangerous offender order. For that
    purpose, she referred specifically to three other factors. First, she
    considered his behaviour while on release between November 2004 and June 2005.
    She observed that although he had failures leading up to the predicate
    offences, he also showed some control and compliant behaviour even though he
    was not on medication or properly supervised. She noted in particular that he
    had told Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> that he was carrying a cord and
    contemplating raping a prostitute from January 2005, but did not act on it
    until June. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second factor the sentencing judge noted was Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Gojers</span> evidence that virtually no resources are allocated
    to prisoners who have been designated as dangerous offenders. Only one per cent
    of dangerous offenders ever get out, so for those offenders, such a sentence
    amounts to a life sentence because parole will not be granted. In contrast,
    there is pressure on Correctional Service Canada to implement a plan for
    prisoners who are long-term offenders who will be released into the community.
    Parole and medical authorities are also sensitized to respond to the needs of
    long-term offenders.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third factor is the respondents aboriginal status
    and the requirements of <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Gladue</span></i> [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688<i> </i>and <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Kakegagamick</span> </i>(2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 664 (C.A.)<i>.</i> The sentencing judge observed that
    although s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Code</i> did
    not apply because a sentence of imprisonment was being imposed, the
    respondents aboriginal status should be considered in all sentencing
    proceedings. In this case, the respondents mother was aboriginal, he had come
    to identify as an aboriginal, and he suffered from FASD. Although the evidence
    was not in the record before the sentencing judge, the factum filed by the
    Intervener on this appeal, the Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto, documents
    that there is a high incidence of FASD in the incarcerated aboriginal
    population.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking everything she reviewed into account, the
    sentencing judge concluded that a fit sentence was a determinate sentence of 14
    years 8 months, of which there was 10 years left to serve, followed by
    supervision in the community for 10 years with the following conditions
    suggested to the parole board:<i></i></p>

  <h3>ISSUES</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crowns position on this appeal is that the
    sentencing judge erred in law by failing to give effect to the purpose of the
    dangerous offender provisions, which is the protection of the public. In
    particular, the Crown submits that the conclusion that the respondent could be
    meaningfully treated within a determinate period of time was unsupported by the
    evidence, and furthermore, that the sentencing judge misapprehended the
    evidence of Dr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> regarding the potential
    for treating the symptoms of FASD. Finally, the Crown submits that she erred in
    exercising her discretion not to designate the respondent a dangerous offender
    by taking into account, the lack of treatment that may be available in prison
    to designated dangerous offenders, a factor which the Crown submits is
    irrelevant.</p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>Issue 1:  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojers</span> evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> provided a written
    report and gave oral evidence. In his written report, he did not express the
    opinion that with proper treatment including drugs and counselling therapies,
    there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the
    community. In his oral evidence, he clarified that he was not prepared to
    answer that question because it contained a legal component regarding what
    legal control mechanisms could be put in place in the community. Specifically,
    he was asked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    just lastly, I take it, then, if I might say where you part with Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>, we pointed out to you some of the specific terms
    that you agreed with her that Mr. [M.] is a high risk to reoffend, but that
    there is you feel once one looks at him as a whole, that there is a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control in the community.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Well,
    youre asking me the million dollar question. I can phrase it this way: There
    are a multitude of treatment options that have not been explored while in
    custody <span class=GramE>that are</span> all reasonable. There are a multitude
    of treatment possibilities that can be put into place that are reasonable in
    the community. The eventual control does depend on the nature of the sentence
    that he may receive in order to avail of such treatment in the community. That
    is why I said a psychiatrist just looking at the psychiatric and social aspects
    can talk about the reasonableness and the possibility of these options being
    available. But there is this additional legal component which intersects and
    involves perhaps other elements Ive not been through in these proceedings and
    listen to other things that may have been said.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojers</span> evidence was that
    in his opinion, the drug therapies directed to alleviate the cognitive problems
    caused by the FASD would make it possible for the respondent to participate in
    sex offender treatment programs, and would allow him to have individual
    counselling therapies to address his many problems with anger, sexual urges,
    socialization and others. Also, Mr. M. was now prepared to take the
    anti-androgen medication necessary to reduce sex drive, and to undergo the
    breast reduction operation, if necessary, to alleviate that side effect of
    those drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> added that he was taking
    into account the burn-out factor in his opinion that the respondent could be
    given a determinate sentence that would allow him to grow older in prison, so
    that when he was released into the community, his sex drive would be lower
    because of his advanced age. At the end of his cross-examination, Crown counsel
    asked Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> about the range of sentence he was
    recommending. He responded that that he was suggesting a sentence of at least
    four to five years from a therapy perspective. Then he would add one to two
    years to bring the respondent close to age 50. He was then asked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Is
    it your opinion that theres a reasonable possibility that he could be treated?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        In
    that time period?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Are
    you just being hopeful?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No.
    Im basing it on clinical opinion. Im not making a legal opinion. I mean, we
    use terminologies like reasonable, possibility, which have legal meaning.
    If I had to translate that into a clinical sense, I would say there are
    clinical issues that this man has that can certainly be modified, if not cured.
    I focus on the modification process. There are clinical issues that this man
    has that can be dealt with to such a degree that whatever risk he poses can be
    reduced to a low level. There are clinical factors like age that would continue
    to decrease his risk as he gets older. His risk will keep reducing, unlike the
    static risk assessment instruments. Clinically his risk will keep decreasing.
    So the additional component is the legal component, how that is combined and
    what kind of sentence of incarceration if he were to be released which would
    then take age into account also. So sometimes its difficult to translate
    clinical concepts into legal concepts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this sequence, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> gave the opinion that the respondent could be treated within a definite period
    of time, being five to seven years and that the risk he poses can be reduced
    to a low level.  He denied that he was
    basing his opinion on merely being hopeful, and stated that it was clinically
    based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seems to be asserting that the sentencing
    judge was not entitled to rely on this evidence because Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> focused on treatability and not on what controls in the community would be
    required in order to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility of control
    in the community. Therefore, she was bound to conclude that, contrary to the
    doctors statement, his opinion amounted to mere hope and speculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel summarized her position in her factum at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 88:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the evidence, the trial judges finding that
    the Respondent could be meaningfully treated amounted to mere hope and speculation.  The evidence about his treatability did not
    support a finding that his overall prognosis could improve within a determinate
    time period so as to render his risk manageable in the community upon his
    release. The trial judges optimism about the Respondents continued motivation
    to undergo treatment was misguided because it rested on the view that
    significant treatment inroads could be made prior to his release. Without
    successful treatment, the prospect of the Respondent sustaining motivation to
    comply with drug and counselling therapies in the community was poor. He had
    demonstrated no insight into his behaviour and his expressions of remorse were
    highly qualified. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> recognized that the
    prospect of indeterminate detention was a strong motivator for the respondent
    and that once it was removed, his motivation could drop off.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In effect, the Crown is asserting that the sentencing
    judge was obliged to give effect to the opinion evidence of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span>, and to discount the opinion of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Gojer</span>. Clearly, that is not the case. Having found both
    doctors to be qualified to give opinion evidence in this area, the sentencing
    judge was entitled to prefer the evidence of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> and to accept it. I agree that it might have been more objectively convincing,
    had Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span> referred to specific examples of patients
    similar to Mr. M. where these treatments had been used and had had the effect
    he says they will have on the respondent.  However, the doctor expressed his opinion
    based on his extensive experience as a forensic psychiatrist treating sex
    offenders and other mentally ill offenders as well as working and collaborating
    with other psychiatrists in the field. The sentencing judge was entitled to
    accept it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of hope and speculation, one must observe
    that because the dangerous offender/long-term offender hearing is conducted for
    the purpose of sentencing, it takes place immediately following conviction for
    the predicate offence and the order is made following the hearing. However, the
    evidence deals with what is likely to occur in the distant future, many years
    hence. One cannot know the future with certainty. More particularly, in cases
    such as this one where the prognosis for the reduction of the risk is dependent
    on the offender undergoing treatment while serving the determinate sentence,
    there can never be a guarantee that it will occur or be successful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the sentencing judge thoroughly
    reviewed all of the evidence. She was under no misapprehension or
    misunderstanding about it. She recognized that the respondent is an extremely
    dangerous man, who, without all of the treatments, therapies, and controls
    anticipated, will continue to be a danger. However, she was entitled to accept
    the evidence of the defence psychiatrist, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gojer</span>,
    that the respondent is treatable within a definite period of time, that this
    treatment will cause his risk of re-offending to be significantly reduced, and
    that with the appropriate community controls in place, enforced by the legal
    system, the risk will be reduced to an acceptable level.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ramshaw</span> believed that even if the respondent had
    FASD, treating it would not reduce his risk to re-offend because although the
    symptoms of FASD are treatable, she believed that FASD was not the cause of the
    respondents sexual offending <span class=SpellE>behaviours</span>. The
    sentencing judge did not misunderstand this evidence; rather, she rejected Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Ramshaws</span> opinion and accepted the evidence of Dr.&nbsp;<span

    concerning. In <i>R. v. Lyons </i>[1987] 2
    S.C.R. 309, the constitutional validity of the dangerous offender designation
    was premised in part on the fact that a designated offender has the possibility
    of obtaining release on parole: see <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 46-51. If,
    in reality, there is virtually no chance of achieving parole for offenders who

    agree that a person who would otherwise be found to be a dangerous offender
    cannot be made a long-term offender for the reason that otherwise the person
    will not receive treatment in the institution. That is not the analysis the
    sentencing judge employed in this case. Under s. 753 of the <i>Code</i> as it read at the time of this
    decision,<i>    </i>even where an offender met all the
    criteria to be declared a dangerous offender, the sentencing judge had a

    I see no reason why a sentencing judge may not take into account the effects,
    based on evidence, of such a designation on the offender. Failing to designate
    a dangerous offender does not, of course, qualify the person to be long-term
    offender, as that requires the reasonable possibility of control in the
    community. However, a sentencing judge may merely impose a determinate sentence
    for the predicate offence, without making any further designation.</span></p>

    on some medication and has discussed the commencement of the anti-androgen
    drugs. Neither party relied on the fresh evidence on the appeal.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent is a highly dangerous sexual offender who requires specialized drug
    treatments, therapies including sex offender treatment and anti-androgen drugs
    in order to reduce the risk, as well as significant restrictions, obligations,
    and supports when released into the community. He clearly qualifies as a
    dangerous offender. The trial judge accepted the evidence of the psychiatrist
    called by the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> who assessed the respondent and
    concluded that with all the treatments, some of which were never offered to the
    respondent before, together with the appropriate legally imposed controls in
    the community, there is a reasonable possibility of reducing the risk to an
    acceptable level. The sentencing judge was entitled to accept that evidence and
    to prefer it to the evidence called by the Crown.</span></p>

    753 was amended by Bill C-2, with force as of July 2, 2008. There is now no
    discretion not to designate an offender as dangerous if the criteria are met,
    but there is discretion in ss. (4) whether to impose the indeterminate
    sentence.</p>
