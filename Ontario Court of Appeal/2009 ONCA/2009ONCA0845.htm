    the mid-1960s, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation deposited asphalt and
    concrete waste from a highway reconstruction project on a nearby dairy
    farm.  It did so with the farm owner’s
    consent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    1981, the respondents, Bernard and Maria <span class=SpellE>Berendsen</span>,
    purchased the dairy farm.  Soon after
    their purchase, the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ cows began to suffer
    serious health problems and to produce an unusually low quantity of milk.  The immediate cause of these health and poor
    production problems was the cows’ unwillingness to drink enough water.  However, the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> claimed that the root cause was Ontario’s deposit of waste material on their
    farm.  They alleged that harmful
    chemicals in the waste material migrated to the wells on their property,
    thereby contaminating the well water and making it unpalatable for the
    cows.  Although testing showed that the
    chemicals in the well water did not exceed the limits under the Ontario
    Drinking Water Objectives for human consumption, the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> maintained that the water was unfit for their cows. </span></p>

    1994, nearly 30 years after the act they complain about occurred, the <span
class=SpellE>Berendsen</span> family sued Ontario in negligence for depositing
    the waste and then failing to remove the contamination.  In a lengthy judgment, after a five-week
    trial, <span class=SpellE>Seppi</span> J. found in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> on both branches of their
    claim.  She awarded damages of $1,732,400
    plus pre-judgment interest at six per cent annually and costs of $655,000.</span></p>

    its appeal, Ontario accepts that it owed a duty of care to the <span
class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> but submits that the trial judge erred in her
    finding of negligence.  It puts forward
    two arguments in support of this submission.  First, it contends that the trial judge’s finding on causation – that the
    waste deposit materially contributed to the <span class=SpellE>unpalatability</span> of the well water – was tainted by palpable and overriding errors and was
    unreasonable.  Second, Ontario contends
    that the trial judge erred in law in finding that it breached the standard of
    care because there was no evidence a reasonable person in the 1960s would have
    foreseen the risk a deposit of waste material 60 feet away would contaminate
    the well water and cause harm to animals.</span></p>

    Ontario attacks the trial judge’s finding that it had a duty in the 1980s and
    1990s to eliminate the harmful effects of the buried waste material and that it
    breached this duty.  Ontario contends
    that it had no statutory duty to remove the waste material or remedy the
    contaminated well water.</span></p>

    dairy farm in issue is a 190-acre farm in <span class=SpellE>Teviotdale</span>,
    a small Ontario community that lies on the border between Perth County and
    Wellington County.  Mathias <span
class=SpellE>Pentz</span> owned the farm in the 1960s.  In 1968, he sold the farm to Bruce <span
class=SpellE>Bawden</span>.  In 1981, <span

    Holstein cows and three heifers), the milk quota and the equipment.  At the date of trial the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> still owned the farm in <span class=SpellE>Teviotdale</span>.  However, by the end of 1994, they had given
    up farming there, and had moved to a farm in <span class=SpellE>Chepstow</span>,
    which is in Bruce County.</span></p>

    to <span class=SpellE>Pentz</span>, in either 1966 or 1967, Ontario government
    employees took truckloads of asphalt and concrete waste from a provincial
    highway reconstruction project and deposited it as fill in a low lying area of
    the dairy farm.  The area measured 100
    feet by 100 feet; the waste material was buried to a depth of six to eight feet
    and covered over with gravel.  At the
    time, the use of asphalt waste as fill on rural properties was common.  In this case, the waste material was
    deposited on Mr. <span class=SpellE>Pentz’s</span> farm with his consent.  </span></p>

    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Pentz</span> owned the farm, he had a 20 to 30 foot deep
    well on it.  This well was about 50 to 60
    feet away from the buried waste material.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After <span class=SpellE>Bawden</span> bought the dairy farm, in 1969, he drilled a
    100 foot deep well about 60 feet away from where the waste material had been
    buried.  During the trial, this well
    became known as well #1.  The <span
class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ herd drank water from this well.  And this well became the subject of most of
    the testing done by the experts for the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    late 1989, the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> drilled a new 65 foot deep well
    – well #2 – about 400 feet from the buried waste material.  The herd then began to drink from well #2 and
    no longer used well #1.  Well #2 remained
    in use until December 1990.  </span></p>
  <h4><span

lang=EN-US>[15]<span

    soon after the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> purchased the farm, their
    herd started suffering from serious health problems and producing a low quantity
    of milk.  The cattle were not drinking
    enough water; their cull rate was double what it should have been and their
    milk production was half what it should have been.  These problems continued even after the
    cattle began drinking from well #2.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> complained about their herd’s health
    problems to the Ontario government.  Ontario responded to the complaint.  In late 1990, Ontario authorized and paid for an underground water
    storage tank at the farm.  It also paid
    for the delivery to the farm of potable water, which was brought in by truck
    from nearby towns.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After

lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile,
    Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment did some testing of the quality of the water
    in well #1, well #2, the barn troughs and the ditch.  Its testing showed that the water contained no

    Objectives for human consumption.<a href="#_ftn1"

    responsibility for the plight of the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’
    herd.  It so advised the <span

lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ontario

    the Supreme Court of Canada reversed this court’s decision: see <span
class=SpellE><i>Berendsen</i></span><i> v. Ontario</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 849.  The Supreme Court held that the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i> did
    not apply because the disposal of waste asphalt was a private or operational
    activity, not a public one.  Thus, the
    six-year limitation period in the former s. 45(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>g)
    of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990
    c. L.15 governed.  As the <span

    waste until 1989, their action was started within the six-year period.  </span></p>

    to the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    the first place, while the MTO may owe a duty to every member of the public to
    repair highways, the disposal of waste asphalt on private land gives rise to a
    duty of care owed only to the landowner involved and possibly a few other
    individuals who could be impacted by the disposal.  In other words, the courts must examine who
    could bring an action against the government for the negligent disposal of
    waste asphalt.  When asphalt has been
    disposed of on private land, and is only causing harm to a restricted number of
    individuals, it is only those individuals affected, not any member of the
    public, who could bring such a claim.</span></p>

    acknowledges, as it must, that it owed the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> a duty of care.  On Ontario’s
    unsuccessful motion to dismiss the claim on the ground that it was barred by
    the limitation period under the <i>Public

    that “the disposal of waste asphalt on private land gives rise to a duty of
    care owed only to the landowner involved and possibly a few other individuals
    who could be impacted by the disposal.”  The
    Supreme Court accepted that this duty, initially owed to <span class=SpellE>Pentz</span>,

    enough to stay alive.  The question is
    why?  The trial judge concluded that the
    buried waste material contaminated the well water, making it unpalatable to the

class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ serious losses on the farm, occasioned on
    account of the persistent herd health and production problems.  The evidence in this trial strongly supports
    the conclusion that these problems were due to the weakened immune systems of
    the cattle which were compromised on account of the cattle refusing to drink
    what they needed when offered water containing these harmful chemicals.  The expert veterinary and toxicological
    evidence reviewed in significant detail in this judgment strongly supports this
    conclusion.  Moreover, as Dr. <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario maintained that the well water on the <span

    Drinking Water Objectives for human consumption.  PCBs, PAHs and dioxins, though present, were
    at such low levels that they should not be considered contaminants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge criticized Ontario’s testing, which she

    was flawed.  Thus, the trial judge
    rejected the opinions of Ontario’s experts on the acceptability of the <span
class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ well water.  As she had on the other issues, she accepted Drs. <span class=SpellE><span

    opinions.  In his September 1992 report,

    water in well #1 contained a number of toxic industrial chemicals at ultra
    trace levels that were not found in rural groundwater near the farm.  These included PAHs, PCBs, dioxins, furans,
    chlorinated hydrocarbons and <span class=SpellE>phenolic</span> compounds.</span></p>

    once, in 2003, long after the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> had moved, and
    expressed no opinion on it.  Indeed, he
    acknowledged that he was “not an expert” on well #2.  </span></p>

    critical facts about well #2 are these: The well was built in 1989; it was used
    for a year; it was located 400 feet from the buried waste material; there was
    no evidence that the water in it contained the harmful chemicals identified by
    Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett</span> in well #1; and yet according to the
    evidence of both Mr. <span class=SpellE>Berendsen</span> and Dr. Cote, the
    cattle would not drink the water from well #2 either.  Therefore, the trial judge’s finding – based
    on the evidence of Drs. <span class=SpellE>Hallett</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Boermans</span> – that the water in well #1 contained <span
class=GramE>chemicals</span> harmful to the cattle, suffers from her failure to
    address why the cattle were also not drinking the water from well #2.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The buried waste
    material was the source of the chemicals in the well water</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether and how contaminants in the waste material
    reached the well water was one of the most contentious issues in the
    trial.  Ontario argued that no causal
    link could be demonstrated between the substances found in the buried waste
    material and those found in the well water.  It called two experts, each of whom testified that there was no
    realistic transport mechanism by which contaminants from the waste material
    could reach well #1, 60 feet away, much less well #2, 400 feet away.  These experts maintained that the soil on the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ farm was indistinguishable from rural
    soil elsewhere in the province.  And
    there was no evidence anywhere in Ontario that contaminants from buried waste
    material could move into the surrounding soil and then into ground water.  At best, any movement would be exceedingly
    slow, taking anywhere from hundreds to thousands of years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the evidence of one of
    Ontario’s experts and did not refer to the evidence of the other.  Instead, she accepted Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett’s</span> evidence, first given at the trial <span class=GramE>itself, that</span> the
    contaminants in the buried waste material likely moved to the well water
    through a process of partitioning and diffusion, which he likened to a sugar
    cube dissolving in a glass of water.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett</span> elaborated on what he meant by partitioning
    and diffusion in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Partition is a term that refers to organic
    chemicals and it’s their ability to – they have different abilities depending
    on different solvents including water, to partition or move …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Diffusion is different … you’re dropping the sugar
    in the water and it first partitions into the water and then by a process of
    diffusion it moves from, the molecules are moving from a very high
    concentration of molecules right around the sugar cube or, in this case, right
    around these areas where the PCBs have dissolved in water you have a very high
    concentration of PCBs in water on a relative scale for PCBs in water, and this
    is going to move out through a process of diffusion from an area of high
    concentration to lower concentration, and that is called “diffusion” …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett</span> further testified
    that the contaminants most likely entered the well water where there was a hole
    or gap in the sections of the <span class=GramE>decades</span> old steel casing
    around well #1.  Therefore, in Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Hallett’s</span> opinion, it was more probable than not that the
    PCBs, PAHs and dioxins in well #1 came from the buried waste material.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett’s</span> opinion.  She was entitled to do so.  But his opinion suffers from his failure to
    address well #2.  He did not explain how
    the contaminants from the buried waste material could migrate to and then enter
    the water in well #2.  This well was
    newly built; it was very far away from the buried waste, at a distance
    permissible even by today’s standards;<a

    chemicals from the waste could reach and then enter well #2 raises a further
    difficulty with her finding on factual causation.</p>

    is unclear to me whether Dr. Cote’s opinion is restricted to explaining why the

    the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ own expert, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Boermans</span>,
    conceded on cross-examination that he could see no link between the chemicals

    that water to the cows.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>Q.        Do
    I interpret that correctly that in your opinion, the chemicals identified in
    the <span class=SpellE>Berendsen</span> well water at the levels they were
    found there, are unlikely to affect the palatability of the water for cattle?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>A.        I
    think I was trying to more indicate I was sure it did not affect the
    palatability in terms of irritation properties within the gastrointestinal
    tract.  In terms of palatability of <span
class=SpellE>odour</span> etcetera, is another possible area but, again, I
    think it was less likely in terms of <span class=SpellE>odour</span>.  Now animals are very hard to predict on <span
class=SpellE>odour</span>, but in terms of sensitivity or irritation of
    chemical I feel comfortable in saying probably didn’t irritate the
    gastrointestinal tract enough to produce and go off their food and water.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>Q.        You
    add the point that it was unlikely that those cattle based on those chemicals
    would be sensitive to the <span class=SpellE>odours</span>?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>A.        That
    was a personal opinion, that’s correct.  I didn’t – I thought at that level your chances are that the cattle

    that is totally personal and it may have been sensitive.</span></p>

    to repeat what I have said earlier, the trial judge does not consider how the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As

    288 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    MOE’s failure to conduct a thorough investigation of the <span class=SpellE>Berendsen</span> groundwater complaint, its refusal to remedy the contaminated water source on
    the farm and its continuing failures in that regard are also breaches of its
    duty to the plaintiffs.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Had
    the defendant not been negligent in the conduct of its investigation and
    fulfilled its duty to remedy the environmental harm it knew to exist,
    particularly after receiving Dr. Cote’s and Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett’s</span> opinions, the plaintiffs’ losses would have been significantly reduced.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario does not challenge the trial judge’s finding
    that its investigation was negligent.  However, it submits that nothing turns on that finding because it had no
    duty to remove the waste material or remedy the well water.  I agree with that submission.  In my view, the trial judge erred in imposing
    this duty on Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s starting point and my starting point
    differ.  The trial judge starts from her
    conclusion that Ontario was negligent in the 1960s when it buried the waste
    material on the farm.  I start from the
    conclusion that Ontario was not negligent because when it buried the waste
    material the risk of harm was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even beyond our different starting points, I take issue
    with the trial judge’s analysis supporting her finding of a duty to remediate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario investigated the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’
    well water for a specific and limited purpose: to determine whether it met the
    applicable water standards for human consumption – the Ontario Drinking Water
    Objectives.  No standards existed for
    water consumption for animals.  Ontario’s
    testing showed that none of the chemicals in the water exceeded these
    Objectives.  Even accepting that
    Ontario’s own investigation was negligent, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hallett’s</span> investigation on behalf of the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span> also showed
    that all the chemicals in the water in well #1 were below the limits in the Ontario
    Drinking Water Objectives.  That is why I
    agree with Ontario that nothing turns on its negligent investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once Ontario concluded that the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’
    well water did not contain contaminants in excess of the existing standards, it
    had no duty to remove those contaminants or even their source.  It undoubtedly had the discretionary power to
    do so, but it made a deliberate decision not to exercise that power, and it did
    so for a legitimate reason: the water met existing standards.  Ontario had already paid for water delivered
    to the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ farm for three years.  It had paid for a water tank installed on
    their farm.  After it concluded that the <span
class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ well water met the Objectives it was not
    required to spend more public money to go beyond the enforcement of its own
    standards.  Therefore, Ontario cannot be
    held liable in damages for failing to remove the waste material or remedy the
    contaminated well water: see <i>Kamloops</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge believed that the duty resided in s. 30
    of the <i>Ontario Water Resources Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990 c. O.40 and s. 14 of the <i>Environmental
    Protection Act</i>.  And she found
    support for this duty in the decision of this court in <span class=SpellE><i>Heighington</i></span><i> v. Ontario</i> (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 484.  Neither the statutes nor <span class=SpellE><i>Heighington</i></span> support the existence
    of a duty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 30 of the current <i>Ontario Water Resources Act</i> replicates s. 27 in force in the 1960s,
    to which I referred earlier.  Under s. 30,
    a person who discharges material in any place that may impair the quality of
    the water is guilty of an offence under the Act.  Neither s. 30 nor its predecessor applies to
    this case because neither provision imposes a duty of removal or
    remediation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 14 of the <i>Environmental
    Protection Act</i> similarly prohibits a person from discharging a contaminant
    into the natural environment if the discharge may cause an adverse effect.  Section 17(a) is more germane: where a person
    causes a discharge of a contaminant into the natural environment, the director
    under the Act may order the person to repair the injury or damage.  Ontario is a “person” subject to the Act, but
    the power of the director to order repair is discretionary, not mandatory.  Although the waste material contained
    contaminants, the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ well water did not
    contain a single contaminant that exceeded Ontario’s allowable limits.  This was the reason Ontario chose not to take
    any further action on the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ farm.  I cannot see any legislative basis that would
    require it to do so or that would give rise to civil liability for failing to
    do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=SpellE><i>Heighington</i></span> case is easily distinguishable.  There, this court upheld a trial judge’s
    finding that Ontario was negligent for failing to remove radioactive material
    placed on a farm in 1940s.  There are two
    important differences between the facts in <span class=SpellE><i>Heighington</i></span> and the facts in this
    case.  First, in <span class=SpellE><i>Heighington</i></span>, at the time of
    trial, the level of radiation of the farm exceeded acceptable limits; the
    levels of chemicals in the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ well water did
    not exceed acceptable limits.  Second,
    the 1937 <i>Public Health Act</i> that
    governed the dispute in <span class=SpellE><i>Heighington</i></span> imposed a duty on the Department of Health to take necessary measures to abate
    conditions injurious or dangerous to health; neither the <i>Ontario Water Resources Act</i> nor the <i>Environmental Protection Act</i> imposed a duty to remove the waste
    material or improve the <span class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ well water.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, therefore, the trial judge erred in
    finding Ontario liable for failing to remove the waste material buried on the <span
class=SpellE>Berendsens</span>’ farm now over 40 years ago and for failing to
    remediate the contamination.  </p>

    would allow Ontario’s appeal, set aside the judgment at trial and dismiss the
    action.  In my view, Ontario was not

    reasonably foreseeable, Ontario did not breach the standard of care.</span></p>
