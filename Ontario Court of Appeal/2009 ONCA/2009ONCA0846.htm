lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario and four Americans states – Michigan, New York,
    Ohio and Pennsylvania – border Lake Erie.  Every year, government representatives from these five jurisdictions
    meet as a committee – the Lake Erie Committee – to discuss the management of
    the fish stocks in the Lake.  The
    Committee recommends an annual total allowable catch for the two economically
    most important fish, walleye and yellow perch, and then allocates each jurisdiction’s
    share of that catch based on a fixed formula.  Ontario’s Minister of Natural Resources typically accepts the
    Committee’s recommendations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister is authorized to issue commercial fishing
    licences, and to attach as conditions to those licences catch quotas for each
    species of fish.  These individual quotas
    for walleye and yellow perch are based on Ontario’s share of the total
    allowable catch.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants carry on commercial fishing operations
    in Lake Erie.  They have earned their
    livelihood from fishing for many years.  In 2007 and 2008, the Minister reduced their individual catch quotas for
    walleye and yellow perch.  The Minister
    did so because she had accepted the Lake Erie Committee’s recommendations for a
    reduction in Ontario’s share of the total allowable catch for each fish.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants then brought a judicial review
    application to challenge the regulatory regime by which the provincial Minister
    imposes catch quotas in commercial fishing licences for Lake Erie.  They sought a declaration that the federal <i>Ontario Fishery Regulations</i> for 1989 and
    2007 are <i>ultra <span class=SpellE>vires</span></i> to the extent that they authorize the provincial Minister to impose these
    quotas in their licences.  And they
    sought to set aside their walleye and yellow perch quotas for 2007 and 2008.  The Divisional Court dismissed their
    application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On their appeal, the appellants argue the same three
    points that were rejected by the Divisional Court: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1) Neither the federal <i>Fisheries Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, nor the regulations to this
    Act passed by the Governor in Council validly delegate to Ontario’s Minister of
    Natural Resources the authority to attach catch quotas to commercial fishing
    licences; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2) The Minister improperly fettered her discretion
    by accepting the Lake Erie Committee’s annual recommendations on the total
    allowable catch for walleye and yellow perch; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3) The Minister’s exercise of her discretion to
    allocate individual catch quotas was unreasonable because of her reliance on
    the Lake Erie Committee’s recommendations.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>What underlies all three arguments is the appellants’
    contention that instead of invariably accepting the Lake Erie Committee’s
    recommendations, the Minister should fix overall catch quotas independently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To put these arguments in context, I will review
    briefly the regulatory framework for managing the Lake Erie fishery.</p>

    2007, the OFR was again rewritten and even further streamlined.  However, the policy change reflected in OFR
    1989 was carried forward into OFR 2007.  An important part of the appellants’ argument on improper delegation
    rests on a comparison between what they describe as a comprehensive federally-enacted
    regulatory scheme governing commercial fishing in Ontario in OFR 1978, and what
    they allege is the absence of a comprehensive scheme in OFR 1989 and OFR

    1989 and OFR 2007 do, however, contain provisions concerning the licensing of
    commercial fishing.  For example, s. 3(1<span

    authorized under a licence, fish”.  The
    provincial aspect of the legislative scheme comes into play through the
    definition of licence.  Section 1(1) of
    OFR 2007 defines a licence to mean, among other things, “a licence or permit
    issued under the <i>Fish and Wildlife
    Conservation Act, 1997</i>”, S.O. 1997, c. 41.  </span></p>

    last link in the cooperative arrangements for managing Ontario’s fishery on
    Lake Erie is the Lake Erie Committee.  In
    1954, Canada and the United States entered into the Convention on Great Lakes
    Fisheries.  Article II of the Convention
    established the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission.  The Commission in turn established the Lake
    Erie Committee. </span></p>

    Lake Erie Committee operates under a joint strategic plan, which was agreed to
    by the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, Ontario, the eight Great Lakes states
    and the two federal governments.  This
    joint strategic plan mandates a coordinated approach to the management and
    allocation of fish stocks on the Great Lakes.  Specifically, the plan states that “protection of fish stock from
    overexploitation by any or all user groups is a paramount responsibility of all
    fishery agencies.  Fishery agencies need
    to make joint allocation decisions on stocks of common concerns.”  The Lake Erie Committee is charged with
    carrying out this mandate on Lake Erie.</span></p>

    a senior public servant in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Manager of the
    Ministry’s Lake Erie Management Unit.  On

    confined to Ontario’s part of the Lake.  The American side is dominated by sport fishing; walleye, in particular,
    is the mainstay of a large sport fishing community.  Consequently, the American representatives on
    the Committee tend to be unsympathetic to commercial fishing and press for more
    conservative total catch quotas than does Ontario.  As there is no weighted voting on the
    Committee, Ontario frequently finds itself in a minority position. </span></p>

    quotas for walleye and yellow perch allocated to the appellants and other
    commercial fishing operations in Lake Erie depend on three discretionary
    decisions by the Minister of Natural Resources or her delegate.  The Minister’s first discretionary decision
    concerns the total allowable catch for each species.  Usually – although, as I will discuss, not
    always – the Minister exercises her discretion to accept the Lake Erie
    Committee’s recommendations.  Ontario is
    then allocated a share of the total allowable catch for walleye and yellow
    perch based on a formula, which has been accepted by all jurisdictions.  Ontario receives 43 per cent of the total
    allowable catch for walleye and 49 per cent of the total allowable catch for
    yellow perch.  These percentages are
    based on a proportionate share of the functional habitat for walleye, and on
    the surface area of waters within Ontario’s jurisdiction for yellow perch.  The total allowable catch for each species of
    fish changes every year, but Ontario’s percentage of the overall allowable
    catch does not.  </span></p>

    per cent of Ontario’s share to commercial fishing.  </span></p>

    delegated is legislative power, not administrative power.   </span></p>

    court upheld its validity.  The
    appellants submit that the delegation in question in <i>Peralta</i> differs from the delegation in question on this appeal.  In OFR 1978, the appellants say, the federal
    government established detailed regulatory provisions for commercial fishing,
    and the provincial Minister allocated quotas within and consistent with those
    provisions.  Thus, the sub-delegation
    from the Governor in Council to the provincial Minister was valid.  By contrast, the appellants say, the absence

    the <i>Chemicals Reference</i>, the Supreme
    Court of Canada had to decide whether a broad delegation of powers to the
    Governor in Council under s. 3 of the <i>War
    Measures Act</i> authorized the Governor in Council to delegate its powers to
    subordinate agencies, though the statute did not contain any specific wording
    that it could do so.  Despite the absence
    of specific wording, the court held that the Governor in Council had authority
    to delegate to subordinate agencies.  Chief Justice Duff put the principle this way at 12:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    repeat<span class=GramE>,</span> there is nothing in the words of section 3
    that, when read according to their natural meaning, precludes the appointment

    plainly within the comprehensive language employed, and I know of no rule or
    principle of construction requiring or justifying a qualification that would
    exclude them.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>That

    is conceded that it was within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament so to
    do.  In fact, delegation to other

    under the Act, deem “advisable for the security, <span class=SpellE>defence</span>,
    peace, order and welfare of Canada” in the conduct of the war.</span></p>

    the absence of specific authority in the <i>Fisheries
    Act</i> is not fatal to the Governor in Council’s delegation of authority to
    the provincial Minister.  As is
    invariably the case, the issue becomes one of Parliamentary intent.  I agree with Ontario that several
    considerations show Parliament intended the Governor in Council, in making <span

    reflects Parliament’s intention that the Governor in Council have authority to

    that the Governor in Council can make regulations delegating its powers and
    duties.  At the same time, s. 43(l) does
    not limit the persons who may be prescribed powers and duties.  The choice of delegate is that of the
    Governor in Council.  And the Governor in

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>When

    delegated to her.</span></p>

    the appellants contend that the delegation to the provincial Minister is
    invalid because what has been delegated is legislative power, not

    appears to be that the Governor in Council can validly delegate only administrative
    powers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Respectfully,
    this contention is misconceived.  For the
    purpose of determining whether a delegation is valid, the distinction between
    legislative and administrative power is irrelevant.  The delegation of any kind of power,
    legislative or administrative, to Parliament or a provincial <span class=GramE>legislature,</span> is not permitted.  The delegation of any
    kind of power, even a legislative power, to an official or to a body other than
    Parliament or a legislature, is quite permissible: see e.g. <i>Chemicals Reference</i>; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Furtney</span></i> at para. 33; and Hogg, <i>Constitutional Law
    of Canada</i>, 5th ed. supplemented (Scarborough: Thomson Carswell, 2007) at
    14-22.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Admittedly,
    para. 63 of the judgment of this court in <i>Peralta</i> <span class=GramE>suggests</span> that legislative power cannot be
    delegated.  That suggestion is
    inconsistent with principles of delegation and with the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s jurisprudence.  Thus, it is
    unnecessary to characterize the delegation of the provincial Minister.  However characterized, the Governor in
    Council’s delegation of its powers to Ontario’s Minister of Natural Resources
    is valid.  </span></p>

  <h4><span

    discretion?</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fettering
    of discretion is a common basis for challenging administrative decision-making.  It is one of the appellants’ grounds of
    review on this appeal.  They contend that
    by accepting the Lake Erie Committee’s recommendations on the total allowable
    catch for walleye and yellow perch, and Ontario’s share of the catch, the
    Minister has fettered her discretion.  I
    do not accept this contention.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span

    makers fetter their discretion when they fail to genuinely exercise
    discretionary power in an individual case, and instead automatically apply an
    existing policy or guideline: see David J. Mullan, <i>Administrative Law</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law 2001) at 115-116.  The appellants argue that, year after year,
    in allocating quotas to commercial fishing <span class=SpellE>licences</span>,
    the Minister has automatically accepted the recommendations of an outside body,
    the Lake Erie Committee, instead of independently determining Ontario’s share
    of the total allowable catch for each species of fish.  In my view, the appellants’ argument fails
    for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    Ontario has accepted, as a matter of policy, joint decision-making on the
    management of fish stocks in Lake Erie.  It is surely not the court’s role to second guess this policy.  It is not for the court to say, as the
    appellants urge us to do, that the Minister should adopt a “<span class=GramE>go</span> it alone” policy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
    Ontario’s policy makes good sense.  Fish
    do not respect the 49<sup>th</sup> parallel; our ecosystem does not pay
    attention to international boundaries.  Cooperative decision making among the five jurisdictions with a stake in
    the Lake Erie fishery is undoubtedly the best way to manage and conserve a fragile
    yet shared resource.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the appellants’ argument does not take into account of the process by which the
    Lake Erie Committee arrives at its recommendations.  Ontario’s own experts and delegates
    participate in that process.  The
    delegate from Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources, along with the four other
    delegates, must agree on the recommendations.  It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the Minister finds the
    Committee’s recommendations persuasive, even compelling, and usually accepts
    them. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    although the Lake Erie Committee’s recommendations are persuasive, the Minister
    does not automatically rubber stamp them.  The record before us refers to two examples where the Minister did not
    accept the Committee’s recommendations: the 2004 arbitration and the 2005
    yellow perch error correction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    2004 arbitration arose because members of the Lake Erie Committee believed that
    the harvest of walleye should be reduced.  However, the members were at an impasse on how to achieve this
    reduction.  The American members insisted
    Ontario make a 40 per cent cut to its commercial fish harvest; Ontario proposed
    a 20 to 22 per cent cut.  Because of the
    impasse, the Committee appointed two experienced arbitrators to consider the
    issue.  Out of their consideration, the
    parties reached a negotiated settlement: Ontario accepted a 30 per cent cut in
    its commercial walleye harvest.  This
    example shows that Ontario did not simply accept the American position on the
    allowable catch for commercial walleye fishing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    2005, the Lake Erie Committee’s recommendation on yellow perch erroneously
    understated Ontario’s allocation.  Ontario did not accept the Committee’s recommendation; it
    complained.  And its complaint led to an
    error correcting adjustment to the allocation.  This example also shows that the Minister has not automatically
    surrendered her discretion to the Committee’s recommendations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    these reasons, I do not accept the appellants’ argument on fettering of
    discretion.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Has the Minister exercised her
    discretion unreasonably?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ related argument is that the Minister
    has exercised her discretion unreasonably because, in allocating quotas to
    commercial fishing licences, she has relied on the Lake Erie Committee’s
    recommendations on the total allowable catch.  In support of this argument, the appellants submit that the Lake Erie
    Committee relies on data of dubious reliability, and that a coordinated
    strategy for managing the Lake Erie fishery does not require Ontario to
    surrender its decision making to a joint international body.  The Divisional Court rejected these
    submissions, concluding that “it is not unreasonable for the Minister to
    heavily rely on the recommendations of the [Lake Erie Committee] when the
    Minister determines the fish quota for the applicants.”  I agree with the Divisional Court’s
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court specifically addressed the
    appellants’ attack on the reliability of the data used by the Committee:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Minister also acknowledges that the data used
    by the task groups may be uncertain or indefinite, but the evidence shows that
    the data used is the best data available.  Moreover, the [Lake Erie Committee] and the task groups are aware of the
    fact that the data is uncertain, and have an ongoing discussion as to how to
    improve the reliability of the data.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>I agree with the Divisional Court’s assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Minister’s reliance on the Lake Erie
    Committee’s recommendations is entirely reasonable.  These recommendations are the product of the
    collective wisdom, expertise and science of experts from the five jurisdictions
    that share the Lake Erie fishery.  Ontario’s own experts actively participate in the Committee’s
    deliberations. And the consensual decision-making that produces the catch
    quotas for walleye and yellow perch.  Viewed in this context, the Minister’s adoption of the Committee’s
    recommendations can only be considered reasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time, Ontario is not legally required to
    accept the Lake Erie Committee’s recommendations.  Although its recommendations ordinarily are
    compelling, the Minister occasionally has departed from them, reinforcing the
    reasonableness of her approach.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  </p>
