  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Gladys Alexis, appeals the motion
    judge’s order dismissing her motion to add the intervenor, Dr. Michael Heiber,
    as a defendant and granting summary judgment dismissing her action against the
    respondents P.C. Darnley and P.C. McParland, the Toronto Police Services Board,
    Scarborough General Hospital, and Jane Doe, a nurse at the hospital.  The appellant argues that the motion judge
    misinterpreted the <i>Limitations Act</i> and erred in applying it to an action brought as an individual for personal
    remedy under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 5, 2005, the appellant sent an email to the
    office of the Premier of Ontario in which she appeared to be contemplating
    suicide.  The police were notified and
    the next day the appellant was escorted by the respondent police officers to
    the Scarborough General Hospital where she was admitted as an involuntary
    patient for a psychiatric assessment pursuant to the <i>Mental Health Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7.  In conformity with the Act, she was given a
    Form 42 which informed her of the reason for her detention, the physician who
    had requested it, and her right to retain counsel.  The next day, she was assessed by a
    physician, found not to be a danger to herself and released.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after her release, the appellant became upset
    with the manner in which she had been treated by the police and hospital
    personnel.  Over the following weeks, she
    met several times with counsel who advised her that she had a strong case.  In July 2007, she terminated her relationship
    with counsel and retained her present counsel.  On March 12, 2008 the appellant issued her claim alleging that she was
    unlawfully detained by the respondents under the <i>Mental Health Act</i>.  The
    respondents then moved to strike the claim and the appellant sought to add Dr.
    Heiber as a defendant.  The motion judge dismissed
    the appellant’s motion and dismissed the claim in its entirety.  He found that the appellant had actual
    knowledge of the material facts on October 7, 2005, and that the claim was
    therefore issued outside of the applicable limitation period in the <i>Limitations Act,</i> S.O. 2002, <span
class=GramE>c</span>. 24, Sch. B (<i>Limitations
    Act</i>) and was statute barred.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two principal grounds for the
    appeal:</p>
  <p>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion judge misinterpreted s. 5 of the <i>Limitations Act;</i> and </p>
  <p>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>the</span> motion judge should have
    left the issue of whether the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> applies to claims made pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> to be dealt with at trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Discoverability Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the first issue, the appellant argues
    that the motion judge misinterpreted and misapplied s. 5 of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  Section 5 reads in relevant part as follows:</p>
  <p class=section-e style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt'>5.<span
style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)</span></span></b><span

    person with the claim first knew,</span></p>
  <p class=subclause-e style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt'>                (i)    <span class=GramE>that</span> the injury,

  <p class=subclause-e style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt'>                (ii)   <span class=GramE>that</span> the injury,

  <p class=subclause-e style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt'>                (iii) <span class=GramE>that</span> the act or
    omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and</span></p>
  <p class=subclause-e style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt'>                (iv)  <span class=GramE>that</span>, having regard
    to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an
    appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(b)       <span
class=GramE>the</span> day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and
    in the circumstances of the person with the claim first ought to have known of
    the matters referred to in clause (a).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not seriously dispute that, with
    respect to the respondents, the first three elements of discoverability listed
    in s. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) were known to her on October 7,
    2005.  She submits, however, that until
    she received her legal aid certificate in June 2006, less than two years before
    the claim was issued, the fourth element for discoverability was not
    satisfied.  With respect to the
    intervenor, Dr. Heiber, she argues that the claim was not discoverable under s.
    5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) and the limitation period did not begin to run
    until her counsel was advised in June 2007 that Dr. Heiber was the physician
    who had requested her psychiatric evaluation.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  In my
    view, the motion judge correctly determined that the<i> </i>limitation period began to run on or about October 7, 2005.  </p>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Knowledge that a proceeding was an appropriate means
    to seek a remedy</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the claim against the police and
    hospital, the appellant argues that there was a triable issue as to when she
    knew or ought reasonably to have known that a proceeding would be the
    appropriate means to seek to remedy her injury, loss or damage, as provided for
    by s. 5(1)(a)(iv).  In the appellant’s
    submission, until she had received clear legal advice, this element of the
    discoverability criteria was not satisfied.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this submission.  Assuming, without deciding, that legal advice
    was required to fulfil this requirement, I note that the appellant had obtained
    legal advice in December 2005 and re-attended the lawyer’s office in February
    2006 and several times thereafter.  This
    advice was received in excess of two years before the claim was issued.  The appellant’s evidence is that her counsel
    consistently expressed his opinion that she had a good case.  The fact that counsel advised her that he
    would have to review the various hospital and police records before being sure
    does not, in my view, delay the start of the running of the limitation period.</p>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Knowledge of the physician’s identity</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The substance of the appellant’s claim is that she was
    illegally detained in the psychiatric unit of the Scarborough General
    Hospital.  It is undisputed that on
    October 7, the appellant was given a Form 42.  Pursuant to s. 38.1 of the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i>, this form is given to patients who are the subject of an
    application for psychiatric assessment and advises them of the basis for their detention.  Section 15(1) of the <i>Mental Health Act </i>provides that the application for psychiatric
    assessment is made by a physician after examination of the person.  The physician’s name and the fact that he had
    examined the appellant on October 6, 2008 were set out on the form.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of being provided with the Form 42, the
    appellant knew or by due diligence could have ascertained the name of the
    physician who completed the form.  The
    fact that Dr. Heiber’s name as the physician who completed the form is
    difficult to read is no basis for suggesting that the appellant did not know
    the identity of the physician or could not have discovered it with reasonable
    diligence.  All that was required was for
    the appellant to re-attend at the hospital to confirm the physician’s name.<i></i></p>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Disposition of discoverability on motions for
    summary judgment</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because discoverability is a factual analysis, it will
    often be inappropriate to dispose of the issue on a motion for summary
    judgment.  This court has thus held that
    such motions should not be granted unless the material facts are not in
    dispute:  <i>Aguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc., </i>[1998] O.J. No. 459 at
    para. 31-32<span class=GramE>.  In</span> the present case, the facts noted above and relied on by the motion judge were
    not in dispute.  They clearly establish
    that, in excess of two years before the claim was issued, the appellant knew,
    or with reasonable diligence ought to have known, the injury, loss or damage
    suffered; the cause of the injury, loss or damage; the persons allegedly
    responsible; and, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, that
    a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy the injury, loss
    or damage she allegedly suffered.  Discoverability is thus not a genuine issue for trial and the motion
    judge correctly concluded that the claim was issued beyond the two year
    limitation period set out in the <i>Limitations
    Act.</i></p>
  <h3>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Application of <span class=SpellE><i>Limitions</i></span><i> Act</i> to
    s. 24(1) claims for personal remedies</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the appellant’s second ground, it is
    submitted that, until it is overruled, this court’s 1993 decision in <i>Prete v. Ontario,</i> [1993] O.J. No. 2794
    (C.A.) insulated claims made under s. 24 of the <i>Charter</i> from the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>.  Further, the appellant submits
    that this issue should not have been disposed of on a motion for summary
    judgment as the question is not sufficiently settled:  <i>Romano
    v. D’Onofrio,</i> [2005] O.J. No. 4969 (C.A.) para. 6-7.  </p>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Scope of the <i>Prete </i>decision</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Prete</i>, this
    court found that the Crown could not rely on the six month limitation period
    set out in s. 11(1) of the <i>Public
    Authorities Protection Act,</i> R.S.O. 1980, <span class=GramE>c</span>. 406 to
    shield it from s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> claims.  In the appellant’s view, the
    effect of this decision is that the new <i>Limitations
    Act</i> does not apply to her claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The <i>Prete </i>decision does contain language
    that could be read as suggesting that the question of whether <span
class=GramE>a</span> s. 24(1) claim is time-barred should be governed by the
    doctrine of laches and not by statutory limitation periods:  para. 13.  However, read in context, these comments express the court’s preference
    for the laches approach over the limitation period set out in the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>.  They do not support the far broader
    proposition that s. 24(1) <span class=GramE>claims</span>, brought by an
    individual and seeking personal remedies, cannot be subject to any statutory
    limitation period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted by the motion judge, <i>Prete</i> has been distinguished by courts of other jurisdictions on
    the basis that the six month limitation period being addressed was an exception
    to the six year limitation period of general application that was available only
    to the Crown.  This more favourable
    treatment of the government by the government was, with respect to <i>Charter</i> claims, found to be unfair.  Chief Justice Scott of the Manitoba Court of
    Appeal found in <i>Zadworny v. Manitoba
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2007] M.J. No. 413, at para. 13, that the court in <i>Prete</i> had <span class=GramE>proceeded</span> on the basis that in an action where <i>Charter</i> relief is claimed “it does not behoove government to immunize itself in a
    unique way from the application of the <i>Charter</i> through a provision which benefits only the government itself.”  Similar conclusions have been adopted by
    courts in several other jurisdictions:  <i>St-Onge v. Canada,</i> [1999] F.C.J. No.
    1842 (F.C.T.D.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. denied, [2002] 3 S.C.R. xi; <i>Garry v. Canada, </i>[2007] A.J. No. 761
    (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. denied, [2008] 1 S.C.R. viii; <i>Jourdain v. Ontario, </i>[2008] O.J. No.
    2788 (S.C.J.); <i>Ravndhal v. Saskatchewan</i>,
    [2007] S.J. No. 282 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant points out that the <i>Ravndhal</i> decision, raised by the respondents, has since been
    appealed to the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court made no mention of the
    Saskatchewan Court of Appeal’s treatment of <i>Prete</i>.  In my view, the Supreme Court’s reasons in <i>Ravandhal</i> (2009 SCC 7) are of no
    assistance to the appellant.  <i>Ravndhal </i>involved what, in essence, was <span
class=GramE>a</span> s. 24(1) claim coupled with relief sought pursuant to s.
    52, of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>.  At the Supreme Court, counsel for the
    appellant Ravndhal abandoned the argument made before us that limitation
    periods of general application do not apply to claims made under s. 24(1) of
    the <i>Charter</i>.  At para. 17 of her reasons, McLachlin C.J.C. described
    counsel’s decision as being consistent with the Supreme Court’s earlier
    decision in <i>Kingstreet Investments Ltd.
    v. New Brunswick (Finance), </i>[2007] 1 S.C.R. 3.  In my view, therefore, the Supreme Court’s
    reasons clearly signal that limitation periods of general application will
    apply to claims made under s. 24(1) of the Charter that are, “brought as an
    individual for personal remedy.”    </p>

style='font-weight:normal'>Disposition of the issue on a motion for summary
    judgment</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 20.04(4) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>provides that pure questions of law can be
    disposed of on a motion for summary judgment:  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  The
    appellant submits that the issues she has raised regarding the <i>Prete </i>decision have not been fully
    settled in the jurisprudence and should not have been disposed on a motion for
    summary judgment:  <i>Romano v. D’Onofrio</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue then is whether the appellant’s proposed
    interpretation of the <i>Prete </i>decision
    raises an issue that is unsettled or novel, such that it could not be disposed
    of on a motion for summary judgment.  In
    my view, a full trial was not necessary to dispose of this issue.  Although a very broad reading of the <i>Prete </i>decision would support the
    appellant’s argument, the issue of the applicability of limitations periods to
    s. 24(1) claims is sufficiently settled that it was within the motion judge’s
    discretion to read <i>Prete </i>as several
    other Canadian courts have – as standing for the proposition that the Crown cannot
    insulate itself from s. 24(1) claims through uniquely short limitation periods.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the adoption of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, the law of Ontario relating to limitation periods has
    now been substantially altered from that under consideration in <i>Prete</i>.  The new Act applies to everyone and the limitation provisions of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i> have
    been repealed.  As a result, public
    authorities in Ontario no longer benefit from a preferential position in
    relation to others and plaintiffs are no longer disadvantaged in bringing <i>Charter</i> claims against public
    authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A plain reading of the <i>Limitations Act</i> makes it apparent that, in adopting the new <i>Limitations Act</i>, the legislature
    intended that the 2 year limitation would apply to claims brought as an
    individual for personal remedy under s. 24(1).  Section 4 states that “Unless this Act<i> </i>provides otherwise, a proceeding shall not be commenced in respect
    of a claim after the second anniversary of the day on which the claim was
    discovered.”  The exclusions set out in
    the Act are listed in ss. 2 and 16.  Among
    the exceptions is a class of constitutional claims.  Section 2(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>e)
    excludes claims based on aboriginal and treaty rights recognized and affirmed
    in s. 35 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>.  There is however no exclusion for claims
    brought under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    and certainly none such as the one brought by the appellant as an individual
    claim for a personal remedy.  It is
    apparent in my view that, at a minimum, the Act was intended to apply to such claims.
     Nothing in the statute or in the
    legislative debates surrounding the adoption of the Act suggests otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, therefore, I agree <i>w</i>ith the motion judge that the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> applies to claims such as the one advanced by the appellant.  No challenge to the constitutionality of the <i>Limitations Act</i> was brought and I do not
    accede to the appellant’s submission that the <i>Prete</i> decision renders any statutory limitation period inapplicable
    to <i>Charter</i> claims brought as an
    individual for personal remedies until specifically overruled by this court.  Once the <i>Public
    Authorities Protection Act</i> limitation was repealed and the new <i>Limitations Act</i> was adopted, <i>Prete</i>, in my view, was overtaken.</p>
