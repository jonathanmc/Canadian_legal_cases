  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the judgment of Trafford J.
    dated June 20, 2007, granting the respondent’s application under s. 24(2) of
    the <i>Charter</i> to exclude intercepted
    private communications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that the evidence obtained pursuant
    to the interceptions violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> because judicial authorization for the interceptions was improperly obtained
    through a combination of improper police and prosecutorial behaviour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of
    the <i>Charter</i> because, in his view, the
    breaches of the respondent’s s. 8 rights were serious and the admission of the
    improperly obtained evidence “would undermine the reputation of the
    administration of justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the trial judge’s ruling, the Crown called no
    evidence at trial and the respondent was acquitted on charges of attempted
    murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and counselling to commit murder.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><span
lang=EN-US>(1) <u>The parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The events giving rise to the appeal took place during
    an eight-month-long chain of shootings in Toronto that left four young men
    dead.  The Crown’s theory was that the
    shootings were all gang-related.  However, it was only the last shooting that gave rise to the charges that
    led to this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 27, 2002, Jermaine and Kevin Ebanks were
    shot dead.  They were the brothers of the
    respondent, Nicholas Ebanks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 9, 2002, Ricardo Greenland (“Heavy D”), the
    Ebanks brothers’ alleged killer, was shot dead.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 2003, Matthew Osborne was shot dead as
    he was leaving a party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police investigating these crimes were of the view
    that the Greenland and Osborne murders were carried out by the respondent and
    other gang members in retaliation for the murder of the respondent’s brothers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 17, 2003, Kevin Walters was shot at but not
    hit.  Intercepted conversations between
    the respondent and the co-accused, Dwayne Campbell, appeared to show that the
    two of them had planned the shooting.  It
    is this incident that led to the three charges against the respondent.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intercepted communications that led to the charges
    against the respondent and Campbell arose not from the failed attempt to shoot
    Walters, but rather from the murder of Osborne four months earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During their investigation of the Osborne murder,
    police received a good deal of information suggesting that the respondent and
    Campbell were responsible for the murder.  In June 2003, the police applied for judicial authorization to intercept
    their private communications.  In support
    of the application, the police filed a 155-page affidavit and about 200 pages
    of appendices sworn by Detective Savas Kyriacou of the Toronto Police Service
    Homicide Squad.  The affidavit summarized
    in significant detail the Osborne murder investigation, including evidence of
    the co-accuseds’ alleged motive and opportunity to commit the murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 13, 2003, German J. issued the
    authorization.  Four days later, the
    attempt to shoot Walters took place.  The
    police intercepted conversations between the respondent and Campbell that led
    to their arrest for the attempted murder of Walters.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    ruling</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, a <i>voir
    dire</i> was held to determine whether the intercepted conversations should be
    admitted as evidence.  Part of the record
    on the <i>voir dire</i> was the seven-day cross-examination
    of Detective Kyriacou on his affidavit that had taken place during the
    preliminary inquiry in August 2005.  Detective Kyriacou did not testify at the trial <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a 317-paragraph ruling, the trial judge sharply
    criticized both Detective Kyriacou and the Crown agent, Philip Enright,
    appointed to supervise the <i>Criminal Code</i> Part VI wiretap authorizations.  He
    stated that “Detective Kyriacou’s preparation of this affidavit amounted to a
    reckless disregard for the truth and for the role of the judge on an <i>ex parte</i> application.”  He also found it unlikely that the Crown
    agent independently reviewed the police investigation and stated that this
    failure was “indicative of a breakdown of the system in this case.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, the trial judge chose to excise all
    information in the affidavit related to motive and opportunity – which he found
    contained certain misstatements or omissions – rather than to focus on the
    correct information.  The trial judge
    then held that the issuing judge could not have issued an authorization on what
    little information remained in the affidavit.  As a remedy, pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>, the trial judge excluded the evidence of the intercepted
    private communications.  There was
    virtually nothing left of the Crown case.  The Crown called no evidence and the trial judge acquitted the
    respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its factum and in its oral argument, the Crown
    contended that the trial judge committed eight reversible errors in his ruling.  In the view I take of this appeal, I would
    reduce the issues to two and frame them more broadly than the Crown:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1) Did the trial judge exceed his
    jurisdiction as a reviewing judge, in particular by </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(a) excising
    all information relating to motive and opportunity from the affidavit, instead
    of only erroneous information, and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(b) finding
    that there was insufficient information in the affidavit to support the
    authorization?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2) Did the trial judge make
    palpable and overriding errors of fact and errors of law in his treatment of the
    conduct of both the police affiant and the Crown agent?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D.        <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin by noting that there are two contexts within
    which standards of review are in play in this appeal, namely, the relationship
    between the trial or reviewing judge (Trafford J.) and the authorizing or
    issuing judge (German J.) and the relationship between this court and the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judges reviewing wiretap affidavits, or any materials
    in support of prior judicial authorizations, work within a narrow
    jurisdictional compass.  In <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, Sopinka
    J. summarized the standard of review at p. 1452:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her
    view for that of the authorizing judge.  If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as
    amplified on the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing
    judge could have granted the authorization, then he or she should not
    interfere.  In this process, the
    existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are
    all relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole
    impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision
    of the authorizing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole function of the reviewing court is to assess
    the record that was before the issuing judge, as amplified on review, and
    determine whether the authorization <i>could </i>have issued.  This review has nothing
    to do with whether the reviewing court <i>would </i>have issued the authorization, as a <i>Garofoli</i> application at trial must not become a hearing <i>de novo</i>: see <i>Garofoli</i> at
    p. 1452.  Nor is the review to take on
    the markings of a trial, where the truth of allegations is explored.  As noted by Charron J. in <i>R. v. Pires</i>; <i>R. v. Lising</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343, at para. 30, “the review is
    simply an evidentiary hearing to determine the <i>admissibility</i> of relevant evidence about the offence obtained
    pursuant to a presumptively valid court order” (emphasis in original).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a similar vein, the appeal court must demonstrate
    deference to the reviewing judge.  As
    explained by Charron J.A. in <i>R. v. Grant</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 531 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This court is also a reviewing court and the test
    in <i>Garofoli</i> is applicable on this
    appeal.  In addition, the usual deference
    is owed to the findings of the trial judge in her assessment of the record “as
    amplified on the review” and her disposition of the s. 8 application.  In the absence of an error of law, a
    misapprehension of the evidence or a failure to consider relevant evidence,
    this court should not interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against this backdrop, I turn to the issues raised by
    the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>Excess
    of jurisdiction</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown contends that the trial judge exceeded his
    jurisdiction in two fundamental respects: first, by excising all information
    relating to motive and opportunity from the affidavit; and second, by finding
    that there was insufficient information in the affidavit to support the
    authorization.  I agree with both of these
    submissions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (a) <u>Excision
    of information</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his ruling, the trial judge stated at para. 233:
    “Third, the affidavit, and its appendices, consist of about three hundred and
    fifty pages.  <i>Most of the evidence in the affidavit was correct</i>” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found, however, that the affiant had
    omitted and misstated some information relating to the respondent’s motive and
    opportunity to commit the murder of Osborne.  His remedy for this omission was “to delete from the affidavit the
    evidence relating to the motive of the crime and the opportunity of Nicholas
    Ebanks to commit it” (para. 212).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in excising all information relating to
    motive and opportunity from the affidavit, even the correct information, the
    trial judge exceeded his jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is settled law that a reviewing judge must exclude
    erroneous information from an affidavit supporting a wiretap authorization: see <i>R. v. Araujo</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992, at
    paras. 56-58.  However, there is no
    authority for a reviewing judge to exclude correct information.  Instead, the proper approach is for the
    reviewing judge, after excluding the erroneous information, to assess the
    affidavit as a whole to see whether there remains a basis for the authorization
    in the totality of the circumstances: see <i>Garofoli </i>at p. 1454, <i>Araujo</i> at paras.
    54-60, and <i>Pires and Lising</i> at para.
    30.  The trial judge did not conduct his
    review on this basis.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) <u>Sufficiency
    of information to support authorization</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the question of the sufficiency of information to
    support the authorization, the trial judge concluded, at para. 241: “In my
    view, the issuing judge could not have issued an authorization to intercept the
    private communications, given my deletions from the affidavit.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in so
    concluding.  I repeat what Sopinka J.
    said in <i>Garofoli</i> at p. 1452 about the
    standard of review to be applied by a reviewing judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her
    view for that of the authorizing judge.  If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified
    on the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could
    have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Araujo</i> at
    paras. 51 and 54, Lebel J. stated the test in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In looking for reliable information on which the
    authorizing judge could have granted the authorization, the question is simply
    whether there was <i>at least some evidence
    that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could
    have issued.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An approach based on looking for sufficient
    reliable information in the totality of the circumstances appropriately
    balances the need for judicial finality and the need to protect prior
    authorization systems.  Again, the test
    is whether there was reliable <i>evidence
    that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could
    have issued</i>, not whether in the opinion of the reviewing judge, the
    application should have been granted at all by the authorizing judge.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying this test to the authorization in this case, I
    am of the view that the affidavit, properly considered with the correct
    information intact, disclosed more than ample grounds to support a wiretap
    authorization.  The affidavit set out the
    following facts:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>three anonymous tips identified either the
    respondent or Campbell as being involved in Osborne’s murder;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>two witnesses told police that word on the
    street was that the respondent was involved in the murder;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there was evidence of motive, namely, that Campbell
    and the victim had had a falling out despite having been friends at some point,
    and that the Osborne murder was related to the murder of the respondent’s
    brothers four months earlier;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>two witnesses saw the respondent at the party
    where Osborne was shot; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there was substantial cell phone communication
    between the respondent and Campbell, with Campbell being very near the murder
    scene immediately before Osborne’s murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the evidence did not disclose
    sufficient grounds on which to charge the respondent with Osborne’s
    murder.  However, the test on a review of
    a wiretap authorization is not whether there were reasonable grounds to lay
    charges against the individual but rather whether there were reasonable grounds
    to believe that interception of his communications may assist in the
    investigation of the offence: see <i>R. v.
    Finlay and Grellette</i> (1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 632 (C.A.), at p. 656; <i>R. v. Schreinert</i> (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d)
    295 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 43.  In my
    view, the facts set out in the previous paragraph easily satisfy this test.  It was not necessary for the trial judge in
    effect to conduct a trial as to whether the reliability of the anonymous
    tipsters, the reliability and veracity of what the witnesses told the police,
    and the other evidence could be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       <u>The reviewing judge’s treatment of the
    police affiant and the Crown </u><u>agent</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made many critical comments about the
    conduct of the police affiant, Detective Kyriacou, and the Crown agent, Philip
    Enright.  Though they vary in their
    wording, several of the trial judge’s comments generally asserted some degree
    of bad faith or impropriety on the part of the police affiant.  Other comments criticized the role undertaken
    by the Crown agent in this case, as well as the role of Crown agents in
    Ontario’s criminal justice system generally.  In my view, these findings constitute either palpable and overriding
    errors of fact or legal errors.  These
    findings were central to the trial judge’s <i>Charter</i> analysis (both s. 8 and s. 24(2)) and are a cornerstone in his reasons for
    excluding the wiretap evidence.  As such,
    these errors constitute an independent ground on which the appeal must be
    allowed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (a) <u>The
    police affiant</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge asserted three times that the affiant
    “intentionally omitted ... material facts” pertaining to <a name="_Ref244493229">three
    main categories of evidence in the affidavit: opportunity, motive and cell
    phone records (paras. 235, 262, 285).</a> In a similar vein, the trial judge
    found that the affiant made “intentional mis-statements, errors or omissions of
    material facts” (para. 203).  In a
    particularly critical comment, the trial judge twice said that the affiant’s
    approach “was, in part, to disclose the information that supported the
    application and to omit information that detracted from it” (paras. 210, 280).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a different but related note, the trial judge
    questioned the affiant’s competence with respect to the overall wiretap
    application process, three times stating that: “[Detective Kyriacou] was either
    ignorant of, or failed to respect, the <i>ex parte</i> nature of the
    application and the role of the judge under Part VI of the <i>Code</i>” (paras.
    236, 262, 286).  In addition, the trial
    judge asserted four times that the affiant’s “preparation of the affidavit
    amounted to reckless disregard for the truth and for the role of the [issuing
    judge]” (paras. 237, 262, 287, 298).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In none of these instances did the trial judge support
    these findings directly with evidence of the affiant’s conduct, competence, or
    professionalism.  Some comments were made
    with simple reference to the trial judge’s several findings that the affiant
    omitted or misstated material information, while the trial judge provided no
    support in the evidence for other comments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, when the trial judge asserted that the
    affiant’s approach was to disclose information that supported the application
    and to omit information that detracted from it, he pointed merely to the
    affiant’s “several omissions on material issues” (<span lang=EN-US>paras. 210, 280).</span>  Also, for his assertions that the affiant
    intentionally omitted material facts, the trial judge noted only, and without
    explaining, that the affiant “knew of the materiality of the omitted
    information” (paras. 235, 262, 285).  The
    trial judge offered no explicit basis in the evidence for asserting that the
    affiant was “ignorant of, or failed to respect, the <i>ex parte</i> nature of the application and the role of the issuing
    judge” or that the affiant’s “preparation of the affidavit amounted to reckless
    disregard for the truth and for the role of the judge” (paras. 236, 237, 262,
    286, 287, 298).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, we are left to infer that the trial judge
    based his comments on the omissions and misstatements that he found through his
    analysis of the affidavit in Parts E.3-E.4 of his judgment.  For two reasons, however, his findings of
    omissions and misstatements are insufficient bases for his critical comments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, some of the trial judge’s findings on omissions
    were either incorrect themselves or overstated the materiality of the affiant’s
    omission.  For example:</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge determined that the affiant
    failed to disclose that Matthew Osborne’s sister, Angela Osborne, said that Osborne
    was “very close” to Nicholas Ebanks.  Instead,
    the affidavit disclosed that Ms. Osborne said that her brother and Ebanks were
    “friends”.  In fact, Ms. Osborne did not
    say that they were “very close”, but rather that they were “like brethren—like,
    friends”.  Perhaps for the trial judge
    “very close” is a better interpretation of what Ms. Osborne said than
    “friends”.  Still, it goes too far to
    decide that a different interpretation “was to mislead” the issuing judge (<span
lang=EN-US>para. 141).</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Part of the reason that the trial judge
    determined that Ms. Osborne’s comments regarding the relationship between Osborne
    and Ebanks were important was because “Ms. Osborne was the person closest to
    her brother” (<span lang=EN-US>para. 141).</span>  However, the evidence is not at all clear
    that Ms. Osborne was so close to her brother and in fact gives reason to
    believe otherwise.  In particular, Ms.
    Osborne did not know that her brother was dating Nicketa Simmonds for the seven
    months prior to his murder.  Indeed, she
    had not even seen her brother in the previous four months.</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge asserted that the affiant failed
    to disclose Ms. Osborne’s information that Osborne had a reason for not
    attending Ebanks’ brothers’ funeral (para. 141).  On this account, the trial judge misunderstood
    either the evidence or its materiality.  The affidavit mentions nothing about Osborne’s absence at the Ebanks
    funeral, so his excuse could not be relevant to the motive that the affidavit
    attempts to construct.</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the affidavit did not
    disclose that the three women who were in the car with Osborne when he was shot
    all told the police that Osborne made no remarks  to the effect that he knew who the shooter was
    (para. 150).  In fact, upon examination
    of the police interviews themselves, it is clear that the women would not have
    heard any such remarks because they were not near Mr. Osborne after the
    shooting.  This was clear in the
    affidavit, so it was open to the issuing judge to see that the women’s silence
    on Mr. Osborne’s remarks was immaterial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With each of these examples, the trial judge found that
    the omission “was to mislead the issuing judge” (paras. 141, 150-51).  This is not a comprehensive list of where the
    trial judge erred in finding that the affiant made omissions or misstatements
    in preparing the affidavit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge’s critical comments imported
    elements of intent or purposefulness or elements of incompetence or disrespect
    for the court to the affiant’s conduct.  However,
    the trial judge failed to point to any evidence for his contentions regarding
    the affiant’s state of mind in making certain errors.  I accept that a gross pattern of omissions,
    mischaracterizations, or other errors in an affidavit could be so egregious as
    to bolster a finding of intentionality or incompetence on the part of the
    affiant.  But the affidavit’s errors
    simply do not rise to that level.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In preparing an affidavit, an affiant should be not
    only full and frank but also “clear and concise”: see <i>Araujo</i> at para. 46.  While
    the trial judge acknowledged this requirement, he ignored its effect when
    inferring from the omissions that they were committed intentionally.  The affiant must exercise some judgment in
    deciding what should and should not be included in a good and effective
    affidavit.  This must admit of some
    discretion on the affiant’s part.  The
    affiant’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry actually revealed a proper
    understanding of the expectations, not wrongful intent or incompetence.  He noted that the only way to capture an
    entire interview is to “include the entire interview” and “I don’t think the
    courts, that’s what they’re looking for, they don’t want to see the entire case
    ..., otherwise, I would have 20 banker boxes full of information in front of
    the Justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering the complexity of this investigation, the
    alleged material errors in the affidavit are not indicative of malfeasance or
    incompetence.  Nor was the trial judge
    correct to find all of the material errors that he did.  In my view, the findings that commented
    critically on the affiant’s conduct were palpable and overriding errors that
    directly affected the trial judge’s <i>Charter</i> analysis.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) <u>The
    Crown agent</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also made serious critical findings
    with respect to the Crown agent’s role in this case and the general role of the
    Crown agent in the justice system.  In
    particular, the trial judge concluded that “[t]he failure of the special agent
    to independently review the investigation is indicative of systemic breakdown
    of the system in this case”<a name="_Ref244493238"> (paras. 263, 288).</a>  In support of this assertion, the trial judge
    pointed only to a lack of evidence that the Crown agent did anything more than
    read the affiant’s draft affidavit and discuss it with the affiant five days
    after receiving it (para. 288).  The
    trial judge thereby concluded that it was “unlikely that the [Crown agent]
    carefully and independently reviewed the material aspects of the investigation
    before determining that the affidavit ... met the standard of full, frank and
    fair disclosure” (paras. 263, 298).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge’s finding of “systemic breakdown”
    was based on a misunderstanding of the Crown agent’s role in law.  The trial judge stated that Crown agents have
    a duty to “carefully and independently review the material aspects of the
    investigation during, or in preparation for, the consultations with the
    affiant” (paras. 238, 288).  He then
    determined that “it was not feasible for the [Crown agent] to carefully and
    independently review the material parts of the investigation in the timeframe
    of about one week allotted to this case” (para. 288).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown agent does not, however, have a duty to
    undertake a thorough investigation into the investigative file.  Section 185(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires an affidavit from the “peace officer or
    public officer” and not from any other person.  Indeed, peace officers are accustomed to making full and complete
    disclosure in affidavits for a variety of <i>ex
    parte</i> applications under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and are trained for this purpose.  Parliament has thereby indicated its confidence in peace officers for
    such affidavits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the context of wiretap applications, Parliament
    added a Crown agent to undertake certain responsibilities, such as ensuring
    that the application makes out the reasonable grounds and investigative
    necessity requirements, ensuring that the application otherwise follows the
    limitations set out in s. 186 of the <i>Code</i>,
    and attending chambers to answer questions that the application judge may have.  However, none of these responsibilities
    indicates that Parliament requires an independent investigation of the
    investigative file or meticulous oversight to ensure that no material facts are
    omitted.  They indicate, instead, a
    gate-keeping function to ensure the procedural and legal compliance of the
    affidavit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Crown agent should help the affiant present
    the evidence in a clear and concise manner and point out any flaws,
    inconsistencies, or ambiguities in the affidavit, he or she should not become
    an investigator and engage in a wholesale review of the file.  This would blur the line between the mutually
    independent functions of the police and the Crown, each of whom properly
    maintains a distinct role in the criminal justice system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the evidence that there were five days during
    which the Crown agent had the affidavit before discussing the application with
    the affiant is insufficient for the trial judge to have found that the Crown
    agent failed to fulfill his duties.  This
    is particularly true given the actual responsibilities of the Crown agent,
    which do not involve a thorough review of the investigative file as the trial
    judge suggested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In summary, the trial judge’s comments relating to the
    failure of the Crown agent to fulfill his role were palpable and overriding
    errors of fact based on a misconception of the legal duties of the Crown agent.  Unfortunately, these findings were central to
    the trial judge’s <i>Charter</i> analysis
    and led directly to his decision to exclude the wiretap evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I make a final comment on this aspect of the appeal.  Near the end of his reasons, the trial judge
    made several suggestions, bordering on requirements, about the materials
    prepared for the wiretap authorization.  He clearly did this with a view to providing practical assistance to
    police affiants and Crown agents.  Among
    his suggestions were a table of contents (para. 308), cross-referencing of evidence
    (para. 309) and sworn appendices (para. 312) with respect to the affidavit in
    support of the wiretap authorization, and, in complex cases, a factum prepared
    by the Crown agent (para. 303).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>These suggestions go well beyond the practical advice provided
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Araujo</i>,
    where, in discussing “what kind of affidavit should the police submit in order
    to seek permission to use wiretapping” (para. 46), LeBel J. spoke in terms of
    full and frank disclosure, avoiding extra verbiage and tricking the reader, and
    providing affidavits from those with the best first-hand knowledge of the facts
    (paras. 46-48).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the courts should be wary about imposing detailed
    requirements on the form or content of the materials prepared for wiretap
    authorization applications.  It is best
    to leave these matters to the experience and discretion of the police officers,
    Crown agents and issuing judges involved in a particular application.  Sometimes the materials (sworn appendices,
    facta) and organizing aids (tables of contents, cross-referencing of evidence)
    suggested by the trial judge will be useful; other times the material will not
    be required or helpful.</span></p>
