style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before answering that question, however, this
    court wishes to address a serious matter arising from the reasons for judgment
    given by the trial judge.    </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE TREATMENT OF MR.
    JASKOT</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stanley Jaskot served as counsel for Julius
    Butty at the trial of this matter before Pazaratz J. in April of 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issues at trial included the value of Mr.
    Butty’s interest in a family farm at the date of marriage and date of
    separation, and the enforceability of a marriage contract entered into by the
    parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his written decision, the trial judge was
    extensively and highly critical of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jaskot</span>, based
    on his mistaken belief that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jaskot</span> had suppressed
    information in a purposeful attempt to mislead opposing counsel and the court.  The trial judge believed that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Jaskot</span> tried to hide the fact that the family farm consisted
    of two parcels of land by treating it as a single parcel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As we will explain, this belief is
    misguided.  It cannot stand, given the
    evidence at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the present litigation commenced in 2006,
    both parties and their counsel were under the mistaken impression that the family
    farm was a single property consisting of 151 acres of land.  In fact, the farm is not a single property
    but, rather, two adjacent properties (a 125 acre parcel and a 26 acre parcel)
    separated by a narrow strip of land that was sold to Ontario Hydro in 1953,
    long before Mr. Butty or his family acquired an interest in the farm.  For ease of reference, the properties will be
    referred to as the “farm property”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This misunderstanding was first brought to light
    in or about February 2007 by Eugene Catania, the property appraiser retained by
    Mr. Butty to appraise the then-believed-to-be-single farm property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon doing background work for his appraisal,
    Mr. Catania discovered that despite the farm property being described on one
    legal deed, and despite a single instrument being used to transfer and charge
    both parcels in the past, the farm property was actually two separate parcels,
    each with a distinct Parcel Identifier Number (PIN), separated by the thin
    strip of Hydro property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 3, 2007, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jaskot’s</span> associate, Ms. Hughes, hand-delivered a letter to Ms. Graham, counsel for Ms.
    Butty.  There were several attachments to
    the letter, including copies of the separate parcel registers for each parcel
    of land and the PIN diagram, which showed the two parcels separated by the
    Hydro land.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On May 9, 2007, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jaskot</span> sent Ms. Graham a signed authorization and direction allowing her to speak with
    Mr. Catania directly.  The cover letter
    states that the report would not be finalized until Ms. Graham had spoken with
    Mr. Catania.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As of May 24, 2007, Ms. Graham still had not
    spoken to Mr. Catania.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Jaskot’s</span> associate again asked that she speak with him so
    that the report could be completed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 1, 2007, Ms. Graham was provided with
    a copy of Mr. Catania’s preliminary summary.  That summary clearly shows a value for two separate properties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Catania appraised the properties as two
    separate parcels of land, and he delivered two separate appraisal reports.  The reports for the two properties were
    delivered to Ms. Graham on October 10 and 11, 2007.  On consent of both parties, the two separate
    appraisals were introduced as two separate exhibits at the outset of trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An actuarial report served on Ms. Graham on
    March 28, 2008 (for the purpose of valuing a remainder interest), also clearly
    references two separate properties.  This
    report was also entered into evidence at trial, on consent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After receiving Mr. Catania’s appraisals, Mr.
    Butty’s subsequent financial statements and net family property statements showed
    the farm property as two separate properties.  These statements were filed as evidence at the outset of the trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notably, Ms. Butty’s subsequent net family property
    statements <i>also</i> show the farm property
    as consisting of two separate properties.  Again, these were entered into evidence at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As we have mentioned, the trial judge believed
    that Mr. Jaskot tried to hide the fact that there were two separate
    properties.  In his reasons for decision,
    he describes Mr. Jaskot as having purposely suppressed information in an
    attempt to mislead opposing counsel and the court into believing that the farm property
    was a single parcel of land.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In light of the foregoing evidence, this
    characterization of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jaskot</span> is <span class=GramE>completely  unfounded</span>.  Opposing counsel and the court had documents
    clearly showing that the farm property consisted of two separate
    properties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result of the reasons for judgment, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Jaskot</span> has suffered unwarranted personal and professional
    embarrassment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This unfortunate situation could have been
    prevented in either of two ways.  First,
    when the trial judge realized at the end of the trial that there were two parcels
    of land rather than one, he should have used a procedural remedy to resolve his
    concern about the matter.  He could have
    – and should have – invited counsel to make submissions on the matter.  If necessary, the parties could have
    re-opened their cases, counsel for the respondent could have been given an
    adjournment to allow her an opportunity to deal with the matter or a mistrial
    could have been declared.  Second, when
    the trial judge expressed some concern about the matter at the end of trial, counsel
    for Ms. Butty should have made it clear to him that she was under no
    misapprehension that the farm property consisted of two parcels of land.  The suggestion that Mr. Jaskot’s theory that
    the two parcels could only, or would only, be sold as a single piece of
    farmland in no way explains away these failings.  That theory could have been tested and challenged
    in the normal fashion.  It does not amount
    to an attempt to deceive the court into believing there was a single property at
    issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court cannot truly repair the damage that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jaskot</span> has suffered.  Having said that, its comments are intended to serve as an unequivocal
    statement that there was nothing improper in his conduct in this matter.  We regret what appears, on this record, to be
    unwarranted judicial criticism levied against him.    </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Julius Butty, and the respondent, <span class=SpellE>Dusica</span> Butty, were married in 1996 and separated in
    2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Butty’s father died in November 1979.  He left the farm property to Mr. Butty and
    his sister, Paula.  Mr. Butty’s mother, Mary
    Butty, held the farm property in trust for the two children until December
    1992, at which time she transferred it to them.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As has been mentioned, the farm property is
    comprised of two parcels of land, separated by a thin strip of land belonging
    to Hydro.  The larger of the two lots –
    280 Golf Club Road – consists of approximately 125 acres of land.  Mary Butty built a house on this parcel of
    land and has lived in it ever since.  She
    does not own the house but does have the right to occupy it until she chooses
    to leave or the farm property is sold.  When the farm property is sold, Mary Butty is to be paid $400,000.  These arrangements are documented in an
    agreement that Mary Butty entered into with her two children in December 1992
    when she transferred the farm property to them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second parcel of land – 700 Highway 20 – is approximately
    26 acres in size.  The house that became
    the matrimonial home is situated on this parcel of land.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1993, Mr. Butty bought his sister’s interest
    in the farm property for $151,000.  The
    purchase price was based on an appraisal prepared by Mr. Grant <span
class=SpellE>Phinney</span>.  The
    appraisal excluded the value of the house which Mary Butty occupies.  Mr. Butty borrowed the $151,000 from his
    mother.  His indebtedness is secured by
    way of a promissory note.  He has consistently
    made monthly payments to his mother to reduce this debt.  At the date the marriage contract was signed,
    he had repaid his mother some $23,500.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before they were married, Mr. Butty told Ms.
    Butty that he wanted them to enter into a marriage contract so that he could
    protect certain of his assets from the statutory equalization scheme.  His chief concern was the farm property.  As has been explained, at that time, Mr.
    Butty (and all other witnesses) believed that the farm property was a single
    parcel of land.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the weeks that followed, both Mr. Butty and
    his mother repeatedly asked Ms. Butty to retain independent legal counsel before
    signing the marriage contract.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Initially, Ms. Butty retained Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Vujnovic</span>.  They met on
    May 9, 1996.  At that time, Ms. Butty gave
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Vujnovic</span> a draft agreement that had been prepared
    by Mr. Butty’s lawyer, Mr. von <span class=SpellE>Anrep</span>, and explained
    her understanding of Mr. Butty’s financial circumstances.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Vujnovic</span> advised Ms. Butty in no uncertain terms that she should not sign the contract.  She told Ms. Butty that she would pursue the
    matter further with Mr. von <span class=SpellE>Anrep</span>.   </p>

    land transfer documents that disclosed the $151,000 purchase price that Mr.

    to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement.  They exchanged letters and draft agreements.  Mr. von <span class=SpellE>Anrep</span> prepared four such drafts and Ms. <span class=SpellE>Vujnovic</span> prepared
    two.    While Ms. Butty periodically spoke with Ms.
    Vujnovic on the phone throughout this period, the trial judge found that Ms.
    Butty failed to take reasonable steps to participate in discussions regarding
    the terms of the proposed agreement.</p>

    a title search of the farm property and identified concerns about it in
    correspondence to Mr. von <span class=SpellE>Anrep</span>.  While it was understood by all that Mary
    Butty had a right to occupy the house on 280 Golf Club Road and to receive $400,000
    by way of compensation for the house when the farm property was sold, Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Vujnovic</span> wanted to clarify the nature and extent of Mary
    Butty’s interest in the house and farm property.  She also questioned the basis on which Mr.
    Butty’s interest in the farm property had been valued.  She expressed concerns to Ms. Butty that the
    draft agreement was overbroad in its application, given the parties’ stated
    intent, and suffered from a lack of clarity and inconsistencies.  </p>

    picked the name of a lawyer – Ms. Godwin – out of the telephone book.  Ms. Godwin was not retained to give Ms. Butty
    legal advice; her role was to simply “sign her up”.  Ms. Butty and Ms. Godwin met briefly on one
    or two occasions.  Ms. Butty testified
    that she did not believe that Ms. Godwin even reviewed the agreement, and that
    she probably told Ms. Godwin she was there “because the prenup needs to be
    signed.”  Ms. Godwin made a single change
    to the contract and the marriage contract (“the Contract”) was finalized in August
    1996.</p>

style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By the summer of 2006, the parties were
    experiencing serious marital problems.  On September 5, 2006, Ms. Butty was served with an application for
    divorce.  She filed an answer in which
    she sought to have the Contract set aside on the basis of duress or
    unconscionability.  She asked that the
    assets listed in Schedule “A” to the Contract be included for purposes of equalization.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following a nine-day trial, the trial judge ordered
    that the Contract be set aside and that the farm property be included for
    purposes of equalization.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found “clear” evidence that Ms.
    Butty knew from the outset what she was signing: an agreement to protect Mr. Butty’s
    interest in the farm property.  He also
    found that she entered into the Contract of her own free will.  He observed that both Mr. Butty and his
    mother repeatedly told Ms. Butty that she needed to obtain independent legal
    advice before signing the Contract.  He rejected
    Ms. Butty’s allegation that she was pressured or coerced into signing the
    Contract, finding there was no type of threat or evidence of negative
    consequence or deprivation if she failed to sign the Contract on Mr. Butty’s
    terms.  He also rejected Ms. Butty’s
    claim that she signed the Contract under duress.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the trial judge found that Mr. Butty
    failed to make proper disclosure at the time the Contract was entered into.  The failures in disclosure can be summarised
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The farm property consisted of two parcels of
    land, not one;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was confusion about the nature of Mary Butty’s
    interest in the farm property;    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The estimated value of Mr. Butty’s interest in
    the farm property was incorrect; and </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The estimated value of Mr. Butty’s liabilities
    in Schedule “A” was overstated because the amount owing by Mr. Butty on the promissory
    note was incorrect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge acknowledged that the first disclosure
    problem was the result of inadvertence because at the time that the Contract
    was entered into, <span class=GramE>neither Mr</span>. Butty nor his lawyer,
    Mr. von <span class=SpellE>Anrep</span>, knew that the farm property consisted
    of two parcels, rather than one.  Nonetheless, given the <span class=SpellE>misdescriptions</span> of Mr.
    Butty’s property in the Contract, which he stated were “material”, he concluded
    that Ms. Butty’s ability to assess her rights and options was compromised.  The trial judge was fortified in his
    conclusion based on the drafting of the Contract, which he found suffered from
    ambiguities and inconsistencies.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, the trial judge exercised his
    discretion under s. 56(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3. (<span
class=GramE>the</span> “<i>Act </i>”) and
    set aside the Contract.  </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the oral hearing of the appeal, the appellant
    abandoned his claim that the start date for support was incorrect.  Thus, a single issue remained for resolution
    on appeal: did the trial judge err in setting aside the Contract pursuant to s.
    56(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Act</i>?</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>SECTION 56(4) OF THE

style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 56(4) of the <i>Act</i> reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>56.(4) A court may,
  on application, set aside a domestic contract or a provision in it,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(<span
class=GramE>a</span>)  if a party failed
    to disclose to the other significant assets, or significant debts or other
    liabilities, existing when the domestic contract was made;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)  <span class=GramE>if</span> a party did
    not understand the nature of consequences of the domestic contract; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)  <span class=GramE>otherwise</span> in
    accordance with the law of contract.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>A PRELIMINARY
    OBSERVATION</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was some suggestion that the trial judge may
    have relied on s. 56(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the <i>Act</i> as an alternate basis for setting aside the Contract.  We do not see him as having done so and have dealt
    with the appeal accordingly.  We come to
    this view for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, as described above when summarizing the
    trial judge’s reasons, we see his discussion of inadequacies in the drafting of
    the Contract simply as further support for his view that inadequate disclosure was
    made in terms of s. 56(4)(a).  We do not see
    that discussion as providing a “stand alone” basis for setting the Contract
    aside on the basis of s. 56(4)(c) of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the respondent’s case was based on
    duress and unconscionability.  It is fundamental
    to the litigation process that lawsuits be decided within the boundaries of the
    pleadings and the case as developed by the parties.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;Times New Roman&quot;;

    court on its own motion is unfair and raises concerns about the reliability of
    the decision.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

    judge acted in such a fashion.  </p>

style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge set aside the Contract pursuant
    to s. 56(4<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Act</i>.  Accordingly, he must
    have concluded that Mr. Butty failed to disclose significant assets or debts as
    the time the Contract was made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, he erred in reaching this
    conclusion and in exercising his discretion to set aside the Contract. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the purposes of the following analysis, it
    is important to keep in mind that courts should respect private arrangements
    that spouses make for the division of their property on the breakdown of their
    relationship, particularly where the agreement in question was negotiated with
    independent legal advice:  see <i>Hartshorne v. Hartshorne</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
    550 at para. 9. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next, we note that: (1) the primary purpose of
    the Contract was to exclude the property that Mr. Butty held on the date of
    marriage from any equalization obligations that might arise <span class=GramE>as  a</span> result of marriage; and (2) Ms.
    Butty fully appreciated this when she entered into the Contract.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We turn now to the shortcomings in disclosure as
    found by the trial judge.  Those, it will
    be recalled, can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The farm property consisted of two parcels of
    land, not one;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was confusion about the nature of Mary
    Butty’s interest in the farm property;    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The estimated value of Mr. Butty’s interest in
    the farm property was incorrect; and </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;Times New Roman&quot;'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The estimated value of Mr. Butty’s liabilities
    in Schedule “A” was overstated because the amount owing by Mr. Butty on the
    promissory note was incorrect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Item #1 – the fact that the farm property
    consisted of two parcels of land rather than one.  The description of the farm property as a
    single parcel was an error made through inadvertence.  At the time the Contract was entered into,
    all those who testified believed that the farm property was a 151 acre farm
    with two houses on it and a Hydro easement across it.  The mistake was innocent and common between
    the parties.  This mistake does not
    detract from the fact that Ms. Butty knew that she was giving up all claims
    against the whole of the farm property.  Moreover,
    Ms. Butty’s lawyer had concerns about the value and ownership of the farm
    property, which were not pursued because of Ms. Butty’s actions.  In these circumstances, the mistake cannot be
    laid at the feet of Mr. Butty as a breach of his statutory disclosure
    obligation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Apart from item #1, Ms. Butty was aware of the shortcomings
    in disclosure listed as items #2 through #4 above, at the time she entered into
    the Contract.  Ms. Butty’s first lawyer raised
    these very concerns and advised Ms. Butty not to enter into the Contact.    When efforts were made by her lawyer to investigate
    these matters, Ms. Butty chose to fire her and hire a new lawyer to complete
    the transaction without further investigation.  In our view, a party to a marriage contract cannot enter into it knowing
    of shortcomings in disclosure and then rely on those shortcomings as the basis
    to have the contract set aside: see <span class=SpellE><i>Raaymakers</i></span><i> v. Green </i>(2006),
    25 R.F.L. (6<sup>th</sup>) 54 (C.A.) at para. 40.         </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore, Ms. Butty did not misunderstand
    items #2 through #4.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In relation to item #2, the only confusion that
    existed was about the correct legal label to attach to Mary Butty’s interest in
    the farm property.  Ms. Butty knew that
    Mary Butty had the right to live in the house on 280 Golf Club Road.  She also knew that on sale of the farm
    property, Mr. Butty was obliged to pay Mary Butty $400,000 as compensation for
    having constructed the house on 280 Golf Club Road.  Mr. Butty disclosed these matters and his
    lawyer, Mr. von <span class=SpellE>Anrep</span>, gave copies of the relevant
    legal documents to Ms. Butty’s first lawyer.  Whether Mary Butty’s interest is best legally described as a conditional
    life interest, a determinable life interest or a licence coupled with an
    interest in land, does not change the fact that Ms. Butty understood how Mary
    Butty’s interest impacted on Mr. Butty’s interest as owner of the farm property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Item #3 relates to the value of Mr. Butty’s
    interest in the farm property as disclosed in the first line of Schedule “A”.  From that document, it appears that Mr.
    Butty’s interest in the farm property was valued at $302,000, after allowing
    for his obligation to pay his mother $400,000 when the farm property was
    sold.  On this view, the value of the
    property was $702,000, a figure considerably higher than the value of $600,000
    as found by the trial judge.  We do not
    see how this could have prejudiced Ms. Butty as it means she was willing to
    give up any claims she might have had to an asset with a higher value.  But, in any event, in the circumstances of
    this case, the confusion over the value of his interest cannot be viewed as a
    failure of disclosure within the meaning of s. 56(4)(a) because Ms. Butty: (1)
    knew she was giving up any claim to Mr. Butty’s interest in the farm property;
    (2) was aware of the uncertainty around the value of that interest because of
    Mary Butty’s interest and because the appraisal on which the value rested had
    been prepared for a different purpose; (3) had been given the information
    and/or documents that disclosed these uncertainties; and (4) chose not to
    pursue the matter.          </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Issue #4 – the value of Mr. Butty’s liabilities was
    overstated by approximately $23,500 because the full debt of $151,000 to his
    mother was shown as outstanding.  We
    query whether the difference is of a sufficient magnitude in the circumstances
    of this case to meet the statutory requirement that it is a failure to disclose
    a “significant” asset or debt.  Having
    said that, again, we are not persuaded that it amounts to a failure to
    disclose.  Ms. Butty was aware of the
    debt and of Mr. Butty’s obligation to repay the loan amount.  If not aware of the precise amounts that had
    been paid, Ms. Butty’s first lawyer knew that Mr. Butty was making regular
    payments and the debt was being reduced.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, this case is very different from <em>LeVan v. LeVan</em>, 2008 CarswellOnt 3713, in which this court recently affirmed a
    trial judge’s exercise of discretion pursuant to s. 56(4) of the <i>Act</i>.  In <span class=SpellE><i>LeVan</i></span>,
    the following factors led to the exercise of that discretion:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The husband failed to disclose his income tax
    returns and the value of his significant assets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    wife did not receive effective independent legal advice and some advice
    provided was wrong.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    wife did not understand the nature and consequence of the marriage contract.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    husband misrepresented the nature and terms of the marriage contract to the
    wife.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    husband’s failure to disclose his entire assets to his wife was deliberate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    husband interfered with the wife’s receipt of legal assistance from her first
    lawyer.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As we have explained, none of those factors is
    present in this case.  In the present
    case, Mr. Butty disclosed his assets and liabilities.  Ms. Butty received independent legal advice
    at Mr. Butty’s urging.  She understood
    the nature and consequences of the Contract.  Mr. Butty did not misrepresent the nature and terms of the Contract to
    Ms. Butty.  While there was a mistaken
    understanding in respect of the farm property, it was an innocent mistake and
    did not result in a misstatement of the size of the property in question or Mr.
    Butty’s interest in it.      </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='Times New Roman&quot;'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and paragraph
    17 of the Order is set aside.  Equalization of net family property, after taking into consideration the
    Contract, is $0.  The appellant is
    entitled to costs of the appeal which are fixed at $25,000, all inclusive.  As the trial dealt with custody and access
    matters as well as property issues, this court is not in a position to
    determine how, if at all, costs of the trial should be altered in light of the
    result on appeal.  If the parties are
    unable to resolve that matter between themselves, and if so advised, they are
    to return to the trial judge to have that matter resolved.</p>
