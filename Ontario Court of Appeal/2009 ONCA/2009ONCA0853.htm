  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge correctly observed that the validity
    of the order of Justice Ducharme could not be challenged in the contempt
    proceeding before her.  The contempt proceeding
    arose out of the appellant’s alleged non-compliance with three paragraphs of
    the order of Justice Ducharme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge did not, however, preclude counsel for
    the appellant from putting forwarding the position that the appellant did not
    have some of the property referred to in the order at the time the order was
    made and, therefore, was not in wilful breach of that order by not turning the
    property over to the respondent.  The
    appellant testified to that effect and offered some documentary support for his
    position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the trial judge held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am, however, satisfied that the Respondent has met
    the three-pronged test in respect of Mr. Bernardi’s failure to deliver the
    enumerated jewellery and specified works of art.  The order of Ducharme J. was clear and
    unequivocal.  A preservation order in
    respect of the artwork was continued to October 2003.  After that, there was an agreement in place
    between counsel that the artwork would not be disposed of, pending ongoing
    litigation.  Mr. Bernardi was a party to
    this agreement.  <u>I am satisfied that
    the non-delivery of the various pieces of jewellery and artwork was both
    deliberate and wilful.</u>  Accordingly,
    I find that the Respondent, Mrs. Bernardi, has proved Mr. Bernardi’s contempt,
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s conclusion constitutes an implicit
    rejection of the appellant’s evidence that he did not have some of the property
    referred to in the order and, therefore, could not be faulted for not turning
    it over to the respondent.  There was
    ample reason for the motion judge to disbelieve the appellant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also appeals the 75 day sentence imposed
    by the motion judge.  The motion judge
    split her sentence into two parts.  She
    imposed a sentence of 30 days for non-delivery of the jewellery referred to in
    the order of Justice Ducharme and a consecutive sentence of 45 days for
    non-delivery of some of the artwork referred to in his order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing first with the jewellery, although we are
    satisfied that the motion judge correctly held that the appellant was in breach
    of that term in that he was in possession of some of the listed jewellery and
    had not turned it over to the respondent, the extent of that breach is unclear
    on the record.  It is conceded that the
    respondent had some of the jewellery (at least three rings) in her possession
    at the time Justice Ducharme made his order.  Because the extent of the breach of this part of the order is unclear,
    we do not think that a jail term was warranted.  We would set aside the 30 day term of imprisonment ordered by the motion
    judge in connection with the non-delivery of the jewellery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The artwork is a different matter.  We are satisfied that a jail term was an
    appropriate sanction for the appellant’s failure to comply with this part of
    the order.  We, however, agree with
    counsel for the appellant’s submission that 45 days was beyond the range of
    sentence that is imposed for civil contempts of this kind.  The manner in which the sentence was imposed
    also deprived it of its potential coercive value in that there was no term of
    the sentencing that would encourage the appellant to return the property that
    was the subject of the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would impose the following penalty for
    non-compliance with the provision of the order of Justice Ducharme relating to
    the artwork.  The appellant shall be
    sentenced to 15 days incarceration to commence on December 3, 2009.  The term of imprisonment will be set aside if
    before December 3<sup>rd</sup>, he delivers to counsel for the respondent the
    Dzama drawings and the painting referred to as “Woman in Red”.  The sentence will commence on December 3<sup>rd</sup> if those two items are not returned to the respondent.  The appellant will, however, be released from
    custody before the 15 days has expired if during that time he delivers the two
    items described above to counsel for the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would note, however, and this is primarily for the
    benefit of the appellant himself, that should he serve the 15 days and not
    deliver the material, he could be subject to further contempt proceedings in
    relation to the order of Justice Ducharme both as it relates to jewellery and
    to the artwork.  The appellant should not
    mistakenly believe that if he serves this 15 day sentence, but does not comply
    with the order, this matter is necessarily over for him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed to the extent that the sentence
    is varied in accordance with the reasons above.  We agree that the appellant has had some success on the <span
class=GramE>appeal,</span> however, the respondent has still successfully
    defended the contempt order.  In our
    view, the respondent should have her costs on the appeal in the amount of
    $3,500, inclusive of GST and disbursements.  </p>
