  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his sentence of 24 months plus 2 years probation
    imposed by the sentencing judge on a guilty plea to the offence of break, enter
    and theft. In imposing the 24 month sentence, the sentencing judge rejected a
    joint submission of 9 months made by Crown and defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the sentencing judge erred in law in rejecting the joint
    submission. Although he adverted to the high threshold for rejecting a joint
    submission and to the public interest and the repute of the administration of
    justice, he appeared to rely on the appellant’s record for so doing without
    adverting to several factors, including the Crown’s stated concerns about its
    ability to prove the case without the plea.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    stolen computer containing important personal family letters from the recently
    deceased mother had at the time been irretrievably lost. The trial judge relied
    heavily on this believed fact as an aggravating factor and used it as part of
    the circumstances of the incident that militated in favour of rejecting the
    joint submission. In fact, by the time of the sentencing, the computer had been
    retrieved and returned to the victims with most of the data on it restored.
    Although it is unclear whether all the mother’s letters were recovered, it was
    an error to believe or act on the loss of this data as a basis to reject the
    joint submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has now served 10 months plus 10 days including pre-trial
    custody. As we would have restored the sentence suggested by the joint
    submission for the reasons it was suggested by the Crown and defence at the
    sentencing hearing, we would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence and
    impose a sentence of time served. We rely in particular on this court’s recent
    decision in <i>R. v. Downey</i>, [2006] O.J. 1289.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also requests a change in the conditions of probation in
    respect of the prohibition on consumption of drugs and alcohol. As the appellant is a
    recovering drug addict, this prohibition may be unrealistic. We would therefore
    accede to this request. The curfew condition will remain.</p>
