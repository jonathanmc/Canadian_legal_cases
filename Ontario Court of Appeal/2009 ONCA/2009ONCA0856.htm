  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, it was open to the motion judge to conclude that
    significant aspects of the complaint made by the father were outside the scope
    of the dispute resolution clauses. Accordingly, the motion judge did not err in
    proceeding with the hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was further open to the motion judge to proceed with the matter,
    despite the mother’s request that it be stayed by virtue of the father’s
    failure to comply with his financial commitments. The motion judge saw this as
    an urgent matter involving “high conflict between the parties” in which the
    daughter had allegedly been alienated from the father for a period of
    approximately eight months. Although the motion judge did not address the stay
    request specifically, it is implicit in her reasons that she considered and
    rejected it. In our view, she did not err in exercising her discretion as she
    did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the contempt finding, the mother did not seek to
    cross-examine on the affidavit material presented; nor did she seek to lead <i>viva
    voce</i> evidence. On the contrary, she was content to proceed on the material
    filed. It does not lie with her on appeal to challenge that decision. Nor, in
    our view, was it necessary in these circumstances to have a trial in order to justify
    a finding of contempt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the finding itself, in our view, there was ample non-hearsay
    evidence upon which the trial judge could base her finding of contempt,
    including the mother’s own evidence in which she admitted to doing nothing to
    encourage the child to have a relationship with the father. In addition, there
    was ample original evidence upon which the motion judge could find that the
    mother took active steps to discourage the child’s relationship with the father
    and his extended family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, there was ample evidence supporting the finding of contempt and
    in our view, the motion judge did not err in coming to the conclusion she did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, counsel for the appellant acknowledged that the
    contempt finding was the only part of the order with which the appellant took
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. In these circumstances, as we have
    been able to decide the appeal without consulting the fresh evidence, the
    motion in that regard is dismissed as moot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs to the respondent fixed at $10,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and
    disbursements.</p>
