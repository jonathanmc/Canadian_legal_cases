style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants sued the respondent doctor for
    damages for medical malpractice in his investigation and treatment of Roger
    Lawrence following his admission to the Welland Hospital on May 22, 2000, as a
    result of severe stomach pain.  The
    respondent, a general surgeon, after examining Mr. Lawrence the next day and
    reviewing test results, concluded that his patient was suffering from
    gallbladder colic.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On May 24, 2000, the respondent competently
    performed the appropriate operation - a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  As Mr. Lawrence was being taken from the
    operating room, he aspirated some of his own vomit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Over the next 12 days, Mr. Lawrence’s condition alternately
    improved and deteriorated.  However, on
    June 1, 2000, Mr. Lawrence started to show signs of distress.  He was air lifted to Mount Sinai Hospital in
    Toronto where necrotising pancreatitis was discovered.  On June 3, 2000, Mr. Lawrence died.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial and in this appeal, the appellants’
    negligence claim focused on their allegations that the respondent failed to
    respond appropriately to the changes in Mr. Lawrence’s symptoms on Friday, May
    26, 2000, when signs of jaundice were noted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At that point, for a number of reasons including
    the fact that Mr. Lawrence was still on a respirator as a result of the
    post-operative aspiration, the respondent decided to take a “wait and see
    approach” over the weekend.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This approach, described by the trial judge as
    the “focal point” of the trial, was the subject of much of the trial testimony
    given by the respondent and by the doctors called as experts by both sides.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants’ medical experts testified that
    on May 26, they would have immediately taken further investigative steps and
    ordered imaging, including a CT scan, an HIDA scan and possibly an ultrasound –
    possibly leading to a procedure known as an ERCP.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The opinion of the experts called on behalf of
    the respondent was that the respondent’s approach to the treatment of Mr.
    Lawrence was, in the words of the trial judge “reasonable”, in the sense that
    he had acted in accordance with the expected standard of practice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Preferring the conclusions of the respondent’s
    experts and noting the testimony of Dr. Mamazza, one of the appellants’
    experts, that the respondent’s decision to wait was merely an “error in
    judgment”<span class=GramE>,</span> the trial judge concluded that the
    respondent did not fall below the standard of care.  In so saying, it is clear that the trial
    judge did not consider it an error that the respondent waited before taking
    further investigative steps, but rather, that in hindsight, it turned out to be
    an error.  Even in that regard, it was
    not clear on the evidence that earlier investigation would have changed the
    outcome in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was therefore not persuaded that
    the appellants had established medical malpractice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge then went on to consider the
    issue of causation.  Again, with
    reference to the medical evidence to the effect that there is no known
    treatment for pancreatitis, he found that it was doubtful that anything could
    have been done for Mr. Lawrence at any relevant time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal challenges both the trial judge’s findings
    of fact against the appellants’ position and his conclusion of law based on the
    evidence he accepted and the findings he made.  A trial judge’s findings of fact and application of the law to the facts
    as found are, of course, entitled to deference.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the trial judge made no such error
    in finding not only that the respondent’s treatment of Mr. Lawrence did not fall
    below the standard of care but also that causation had not been established.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He correctly applied the law to facts supported
    by the evidence.  We see no reason to
    interfere with his characterization of the respondent’s management of Mr.
    Lawrence’s complex medical situation as an error in clinical judgment resulting
    in misadventure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the agreement of counsel, costs to the
    respondent, if demanded, are fixed in the amount of $25,000 including interest
    and GST.</p>
