style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Avelino Fernandes, appeals from
    the judgment of S. Chapnik J. of the Superior Court of Justice, dated July 8,
    2008, ruling that the long-term disability policy issued to the appellant by
    the respondent, RBC Life Insurance Company (“RBC”), is void on the basis of
    non-disclosure by Fernandes of facts material to the insurance in his insurance
    application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As argued before this court, Fernandes raises
    two main grounds of appeal.  He argues
    that the trial judge erred: (i) by finding that the questionnaire completed by Fernandes
    as part of his insurance application contained material misrepresentations
    regarding his medical history; and (ii) by holding that materiality was
    established even though the evidence indicated that coverage would have been
    provided by RBC subject to certain exclusions if the alleged misrepresentations
    had not been made.  In the alternative,
    Fernandes submits that the trial judge erred in her assessment of costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the able submissions of
    Fernandes’ counsel, which greatly assisted the court, we conclude that the
    appeal must be dismissed for the following reasons.</p>
  <h2>1.         Misrepresentations</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We did not call on RBC to respond to Fernandes’
    attack on the trial judge’s finding that he did not disclose and misrepresented
    certain facts bearing upon his insurability in his insurance application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fernandes completed and submitted his insurance
    application to RBC on November 9, 2000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is accepted that the application formed part
    of the policy ultimately issued by RBC.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ruled that the questions posed
    in the questionnaire that formed part of the application required Fernandes to
    disclose the identity of his attending physician, his consultation with that
    physician four or five months prior to the date of the insurance application
    regarding lumbar pain, the accurate date and purpose of his last consultation
    with a physician prior to the date of the insurance application, and his
    attendances with and the treatment received by him from an orthopaedic surgeon between
    1998 and 2000.  The trial judge held that
    Fernandes failed to disclose and, in some instances, misrepresented the facts
    relating to each of these matters. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We are satisfied that these findings were
    available to the trial judge on the evidence.  In particular, we agree that, properly construed, the insurance
    questionnaire required disclosure of the matters identified by the trial judge
    as described above, and that such disclosure was not made.  Fernandes’ failure to disclose this
    information was a breach of his obligation to disclose all material facts
    bearing upon his insurability for long-term disability benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, we observe that nothing in the
    insurance questionnaire grounds the appellant’s claim that he was obliged to
    disclose only “serious” or “major” medical complaints and treatments in his
    responses to the questions posed.  The
    language used in the relevant questions is not qualified in this fashion.  Nor do we agree with Fernandes’ suggested construction
    of the questionnaire, read as a whole.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, the trial judge implicitly rejected
    the <i>bona fides</i> of Fernandes’ claim
    that he read the questionnaire in this way.  She held that his answers to at least some of the questions in the
    questionnaire were knowingly misleading and that while he understood the
    questions asked, he “simply placed his own interpretation on them”.</p>
  <h2>2.         Materiality and the Issue
    of Exclusions</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fernandes does not challenge the trial judge’s
    holding that, as a matter of law, “There is … no need to relate the medical
    information not disclosed on the application for insurance to the subsequent
    disability claim” (citations omitted).  As this statement was not put in issue on this appeal, we assess the
    trial judge’s materiality findings on this basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is common ground that Fernandes became
    disabled in approximately January 2001 from acute meningitis and <span
class=GramE>that,</span> as a result, he has been unable to return to his work
    as a rough carpenter in the construction industry to date.  It was this condition that formed the basis
    of his long-term disability claim in March 2001.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is also common ground that the information
    that Fernandes failed to disclose in the insurance questionnaire included facts
    related to his past medical complaints regarding his back and hip areas.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fernandes was obliged under s. 308(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 to
    disclose to RBC in his insurance application every fact within his knowledge
    that was material to the insurance for which he was applying.  The insurance application clearly and
    unambiguously warned that the provision of “false or incomplete answers to any
    question will affect the coverage and benefits available under the policy, and
    may mean that there will be no coverage and may result in legal action”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, the insurance application signed by Fernandes
    contained an explicit acknowledgement by him that he was “responsible for the
    accuracy of the statements” contained in the application and that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Before signing, I have verified that all answers are
    correct and complete <span class=GramE>…  Inaccurate</span> answers to any questions may affect my eligibility for
    coverage and/or benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is unnecessary to recite in detail the
    specifics of the information not disclosed by Fernandes in response to the
    questions posed in the questionnaire.  It
    is sufficient to note that there was evidence at trial from an experienced RBC
    underwriter establishing that the information omitted by Fernandes, if
    disclosed, would have borne directly on the insurer’s assessment of risk and
    its willingness to issue standard long-term disability coverage, without
    exclusions, in Fernandes’ favour.  In
    particular, the evidence indicated that the non-disclosed medical information
    was significant from an underwriting perspective.  There was evidence before the trial judge
    that this information, together with the timing of the medical-related events
    and the nature of Fernandes’ occupation as a rough carpenter in the
    construction trade, would have altered RBC’s risk assessment and the scope of
    the insurance it was prepared to offer to Fernandes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was also evidence at trial from an
    independent underwriting expert that RBC’s approach to risk assessment and the
    claim, which would have resulted in exclusions to the coverage, conformed <span
class=GramE>with</span> industry underwriting standards.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge, as she was entitled to do,
    accepted this evidence.  Accordingly,
    there was a firm evidential foundation for her ruling that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he matters concealed or misrepresented in this
    case would, on a fair and reasonable consideration of the evidence, have been
    material to the risk and would have influenced [RBC] to decline to issue the
    standard policy it offered to [Fernandes].  In the circumstances, I find that, in treating [Fernandes’] untrue or
    incomplete answers as material, the defendant was acting as a reasonable
    insurer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the omitted or
    misrepresented information was not material as RBC would have extended cover in
    any event, albeit subject to one or more “waivers” or “riders”, that is,
    exclusions.  We disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>A coverage</span> exclusion is
    a critical and integral part of an insurance policy.  An exclusion functions as a limitation on the
    scope of the insuring agreement and the coverage offered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence here, accepted by the trial judge,
    established that but for the misrepresentations and non-disclosure at issue,
    the coverage offered would have been subject to full exclusions for back and
    hip-related ailments.  By virtue of
    Fernandes’ conduct, the exclusions were not issued and the insurer was deprived
    of the opportunity to narrow the ambit of the risk that it was prepared to
    assume and to adjust the premium charged accordingly.  We therefore agree with the trial judge that
    RBC “would have changed the policy offered to the plaintiff in a material and
    fundamental way, had [it] known the true facts”.</p>
  <h2>3.         Costs Award</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fernandes argues, in the alternative, that the
    trial judge erred in her costs assessment by failing to consider his reasonable
    expectations, as the eventual ‘losing’ party, concerning the costs of the
    litigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jurisdiction of this court to interfere with
    a trial judge’s discretionary costs award is limited.  Absent an error in principle or unless the
    award is plainly wrong, appellate intervention is precluded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, having given the matter careful
    consideration, we see no principled basis on which to disturb the trial judge’s
    costs award.  This case involved numerous
    pre-trial attendances and a five-day trial in which Fernandes advanced
    allegations of bad faith against the insurer.  As pleaded, he also sought punitive damages in the amount of $1
    million.  As noted by the trial judge, these
    claims were never withdrawn. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the record before us, there is no evidence as
    to the costs incurred by the appellant with his own trial counsel.  Accordingly, no comparison of the appellant’s
    incurred litigation costs with those of the insurer is possible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, we see no error in principle by the
    trial judge regarding costs.  We note
    that she did consider the appellant’s reasonable expectations concerning the
    cost of the litigation.  And we simply
    are unable to say that the costs award, which was lower than the full partial
    indemnity costs sought by the insurer, is plainly wrong.</p>
  <h2>4.         Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of
    the appeal, if sought.  In all the
    circumstances of this case, we fix those costs in the total amount of $10,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
