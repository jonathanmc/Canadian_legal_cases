style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case arises out of a motor vehicle
    accident, the consequences of which were tragic for all concerned.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During oral argument, the focus of the
    appellants’ attack on the trial judge’s decision narrowed considerably.  As argued, the appellants challenge the trial
    judge’s finding in negligence that Mr. Kurtz was partially liable for Mr.
    Greer’s injuries.  The appellants did not
    pursue their appeal from the trial judge’s apportionment of liability.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the trial judge’s finding of
    negligence against Mr. Kurtz was open to him on the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Greer vehicle entered Mr. Kurtz’s lane of
    travel on two occasions, the first time when the vehicles were separated by a
    distance of about 300 metres.  The trial
    judge held that while Mr. Kurtz slowed his vehicle after Mr. Greer first entered
    his lane, he did not do so sufficiently in all the circumstances and that, if
    Mr. Kurtz had done so, “it would have at least lowered the impact speed”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was ample evidence to support this
    finding.  First, Mr. Kurtz testified that,
    although he initially took his foot off the accelerator when he first saw the
    Greer vehicle, he again put his foot on the gas pedal and kept on driving after
    Mr. Greer went back into his own lane.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, throughout his testimony, Mr. Kurtz
    indicated that he believed the Greer vehicle came back under Mr. Greer’s
    control when it returned to Mr. Greer’s lane.  Under cross-examination however, he appears to have accepted his wife’s
    testimony on discovery that it was unclear whether the vehicle was back under
    control when Mr. Greer returned to his own lane.  The trial judge fairly held that Mr. Kurtz
    “may or may not have felt that the Greer vehicle was under control when it went
    back into its own lane”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this evidence, at the very least, Mr. Kurtz
    proceeded on the assumption, under icy and snow-windy conditions, that the
    Greer vehicle was under control and would remain so.  In these circumstances, the trial judge did
    not err in essentially concluding that Mr. Kurtz should have taken further
    precautionary action by continuing to slow his vehicle.  See <i>Gill
    Estate v. Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd.</i>, [1987] B.C.J. No. 2452.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants rely on <i>Dennis v. Gairdner</i>, [2002] B.C.J. No. 2017 to argue that since Mr.
    Kurtz took all necessary precautions in the circumstances, his actions were
    reasonable and not negligent.  But in <i>Dennis</i>, the trial judge specifically
    found that the defendant, having slowed down on seeing the first fish-tailing
    of the other vehicle, “kept her foot over the brake ready to take evasive
    action”.  The court held that she “had
    taken precautions which would allow her flexibility of further evasive action
    based on what she had observed of the movements of the [other vehicle]”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That is not this case.  In this case, in a decision that admittedly
    was made quickly and perhaps even instinctively, Mr. Kurtz put his foot back on
    the accelerator.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also do not agree that the trial judge’s
    findings are tantamount to a ruling that Mr. Kurtz should have applied his
    brakes.  The trial judge simply held that
    Mr. Kurtz should have slowed his vehicle more than he did and that his failure
    to do so <span class=GramE>meant</span> that the speed of impact was greater
    than it otherwise would have been.  The
    evidence before the trial judge, some of which we have alluded to above,
    supports this finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the trial judge’s impugned negligence
    finding is not related to avoidance of the accident.  As we have said, it is directed to Mr.
    Kurtz’s failure to slow his vehicle adequately, the result of which was to make
    the force of the collision greater than it otherwise would have been.  This is negligence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal, therefore, is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled to their costs
    of the appeal, fixed in the amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
