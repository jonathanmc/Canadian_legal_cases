  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a crown appeal against sentence.  The respondent, Robert Belanger, pleaded
    guilty to dangerous driving causing bodily harm.  On March 10, 2009 he was given a 60-day
    intermittent sentence, two years probation and a 3-year driving
    prohibition.  The Crown contends that the
    sentence is demonstrably unfit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her factum, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Nakelsky</span> has fairly and thoroughly set out the relevant facts.  Mr. Belanger was driving on Highway 401 near
    Port Union.  He had consumed a
    considerable amount of alcohol, though the evidence fell short of establishing
    that he was over the legal limit.  The
    victim, Kimberly <span class=SpellE>Maiolo</span>, and her husband had parked
    their van on the “bull nose” of the highway to change a flat tire.  Mr. Belanger was speeding when he cut across
    the main part of the highway to the collector lanes.  As he did so, he crashed into Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Maiolo</span> while she stood beside her van.  As a result of the collision, Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Maiolo’s</span> leg was completely severed from her body.  Although the police later recovered her leg,
    it could not be reattached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collision has had a devastating and permanent effect
    on Ms. <span class=SpellE>Maiolo</span>.  She was 41 years old at the time.  She sustained acute injuries, including the leg amputation, fractures to
    her pelvis, back and right wrist, and damage to the ligaments in her left
    knee.  She now has a prosthetic leg, pain
    in her back, and symptoms of arthritis.  Her physical injuries have been exacerbated by the psychological
    consequences of the collision she now endures.  She has feelings of depression, fury and hate.  In her words “my life is a mess.  Some days I can’t stand all the physical pain
    and agony in my heart”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was of the view that Mr. Belanger
    would likely have been a candidate for a conditional sentence.  However, he recognized that the recent
    amendments to s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> precluded a conditional sentence for a serious personal injury offence
    such as this one where the Crown had proceeded by way of indictment.  He, therefore, imposed a 60-day intermittent
    term of incarceration, to be served on weekends.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Crown that the sentence imposed by
    the sentencing judge was demonstrably unfit.  Although the sentencing judge recognized the importance of denunciation
    and general deterrence, the sentence he imposed did not adequately reflect these
    principles, or adequately recognize the profound harm to Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Maiolo</span> caused by Mr. Belanger’s dangerous driving.  In our view, a non-intermittent custodial
    sentence was warranted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, nine months have now passed since Mr. Belanger
    was sentenced.  He has served all 60 days
    of his intermittent sentence.  We do not
    consider it in the public interest to now re-incarcerate him.  He is in his late 60s; he had no previous
    criminal record; he is the sole support of his wife, who is 11 years older than
    he is, and their daughter; both he and his wife have serious health
    problems.  Nothing is to be gained by now
    putting Mr. Belanger in jail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where we do think it is appropriate to intervene is on
    the length of the driving prohibition.  The trial Crown asked for a prohibition of three to five years.  The sentencing judge imposed a three year
    prohibition.  We have decided to increase
    the driving prohibition to five years.  Although Mr. Belanger had no criminal record, he had 10 previous
    speeding convictions.  In the light of
    this record and the offence before the court, he should not be driving for a
    long time.  In a case such as this one, a
    lengthy driving prohibition, not incarceration, is a more meaningful way to
    promote general deterrence and denunciation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and
    the appeal is allowed in part by increasing the driving prohibition from three
    years to five years.  </p>
