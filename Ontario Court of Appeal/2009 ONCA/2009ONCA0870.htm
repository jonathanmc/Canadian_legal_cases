  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essential feature of a condominium corporation is
    its mix of private residential units and common space.  In the <i>Condominium
    Act</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 19, s. 1(1), the common space is called “common
    elements” which means “all the property except the units”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Typically, the common elements of a condominium
    corporation are divided into two categories – areas which can be used by all of
    the owners (for example, lobbies, driveways, garages and guest facilities) and
    areas reserved for the use of only one owner (for example, the patio or lawn
    area immediately contiguous to a unit).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 98(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i> requires that an owner obtain the approval of the
    condominium corporation’s board of directors if the owner seeks to “make an
    addition, alteration or improvement to the common elements” of the
    corporation.  The respondent, Jim McMahon
    (“McMahon”), the owner of a unit in the appellant condominium corporation,
    installed a hot tub on his backyard patio.  He did not obtain the approval of the appellant’s board.  The appellant brought an application seeking
    the removal of the hot tub.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge agreed with McMahon.  Justice Henderson concluded that a hot tub
    was not an addition, alteration or improvement within the meaning of s. 98(1)
    of the <i>Condominium Act.</i>  The correctness of this interpretation is the
    principal issue posed by this appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The
    parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Wentworth Condominium Corporation No.
    198, is a condominium corporation located in Waterdown and is comprised of 31
    town-house style residential condominium units.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Jim McMahon, is a 73-year-old retiree
    who has owned unit 27 since 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each unit in the condominium complex contains a back
    yard that forms part of the common elements of the corporation.  Each owner has exclusive use of their common
    element back yard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 2007, McMahon applied for approval from the
    board of directors to install a hot tub on his back patio.  The board did not grant the approval.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 7, 2007, McMahon installed a hot tub on the
    back patio.  The hot tub is six feet
    wide, seven feet long and four feet high.  It is a one-piece unit that weighs about 300 lbs. without any water in
    it.  It was installed by two delivery
    men.  It is filled by a garden hose and
    holds 1000 litres of water weighing 1000 kilograms.  The hot tub occupies about 25 per cent of the
    common element back yard of unit 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hot tub is hard-wired to unit 27.  A three-wire electrical cable was installed
    that runs from the electrical panel located in McMahon’s basement and outside
    to the hot tub, where it is connected to the hot tub with three screws.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    application</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The condominium corporation made an application
    seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, the permanent
    removal of the hot tub.  The application
    judge considered the matter in the context of s. 98(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>.  He reviewed relevant case law and dictionary
    definitions of “add”, “alter” and “improve”.  This led him to define the pivotal words of s. 98(1) in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, I find that the word “addition” means
    something that is joined or connected to a structure, and the word “alteration”
    means something that changes the structure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that the word “improvement” means the
    betterment of the property or enhancement of the value of the property.  I also accept that an “improvement” refers to
    an improvement or betterment <i>of the
    property</i>.  That is, to be an
    improvement there must be an increase in the value of the property.  If the item increases the enjoyment of the
    property, but does not increase the value of the property, I find that the item
    is not an improvement.  [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying these definitions to McMahon’s hot tub, the
    application judge reached these conclusions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The hot tub is not an addition as it is not
    something that sensibly can be seen as being joined to or connected to the
    structure.  It is connected by an
    electrical cable, but the purpose of the electrical cable is to supply power to
    the hot tub, not to fix the hot tub to the structure.  Furthermore, even though it may take a
    half-hour and two men to move, the hot tub is still designed to be removed from
    the property.  It is not a permanent
    fixture on the property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The hot tub is not an alteration as it does not
    change the structure of the property.  The hot tub may alter the landscape, but any such alteration does not
    cause any permanent change to the structure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The hot tub is not an improvement as it does not
    increase the value of the condominium unit.  It is not a fixture that is so attached to the property that it becomes
    a part of the property.  Thus, it cannot
    increase the value of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the application judge concluded that
    “McMahon does not require the approval of the board to place the hot tub in the
    exclusive use common element area on his patio.”  He dismissed the condominium corporation’s
    application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The condominium corporation appeals.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three issues:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    application judge err by not determining that the installation of the hot tub
    contravened ss. 116 and 117 of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i>?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>Section
    98(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i></u><i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the principal issue in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 98(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>98.(1) An owner may make an addition, alteration or
    improvement to the common elements that is not contrary to this Act or the
    declaration if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the board, by
    resolution, has approved the proposed addition, alteration or improvement;….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that the hot tub was
    not an addition, alteration or improvement within the meaning of this
    section.  The appellant contends that his
    interpretation is flawed for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant submits that the application judge
    did not apply the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words “addition”,
    “alteration” and “improvement”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The application
    judge’s starting point for determining the meaning of these words was the
    dictionary.  In my view, this is
    precisely where he should have started.  Indeed, this is where Cory J.A. started his analysis when he had to
    define the words “maintenance” and “repair” in a previous version of the <i>Condominium Act</i>: see <i>York Condominium Corp. No. 59 v. York
    Condominium Corp. No. 87</i> (1983), 42 O.R. (2d) 337 (C.A.), at p. 341.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant contends that the words
    “addition”, “alteration” and “improvement”, at least as they are used in s.
    98(1) of the <i>Act</i>, have a shared or
    common meaning – namely, a change of the original condition of some physical
    thing or matter.  As expressed in its factum:
    “If one adds some thing to another thing or matter, the pre-existing condition
    of the latter is changed.  If one alters
    some thing or matter, the pre-existing condition of the latter is changed.  If one improves some thing or matter, the
    pre-existing condition of the latter is changed.”  The application judge, says the appellant,
    should have concluded that the legislature likely intended by its use of the
    words “addition”, “alteration” and “improvement” to signal that any act of an
    owner that changes the pre-existing condition of the common elements of the
    condominium property requires the consent of the board of directors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected this submission, saying
    that “each of the three words has a separate and distinct meaning.”  I agree.  In my view, the differences are readily apparent from the dictionary
    definitions cited by the application judge.  An addition builds on or supplements what is already there.  An alteration can add to or subtract from
    what is already there.  And an improvement
    introduces a qualitative factor into the analysis, one not required by the
    words “addition” and “alteration”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is another and, in my view, crucial flaw in the
    appellant’s attempt to lump together the three words in s. 98(1) of the <i>Act.</i>  The equation of “addition”, “alteration” and “improvement” with “change”
    creates a result that is far too broad.  Barbecues, picnic tables, small inflatable swimming pools, children’s
    toys and thousands of other ordinary articles that are regularly found on backyard
    patios would constitute “changes” to the common elements of the condominium
    property under the appellant’s definition because they would “make different
    the pre-existing condition of the common elements”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed the barbecue analogy relied on by the respondent
    strikes me as particularly apt.  Both the
    barbecue and the hot tub are placed somewhere on the patio stones.  Both are connected in a limited sense to the
    condominium unit, the barbecue by a gas line and the hot tub by an electrical
    cable.  Yet, as the application judge
    observed, the condominium corporation has not required any owner to seek
    approval to install a barbecue on the patio common elements of the condominium
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s third submission is that the
    application judge did not examine the <i>Condominium
    Act</i> as a whole.  If he had done this,
    says the appellant, he would have recognized that the Act focuses on the
    integrity and condition of the common elements and that these have primacy over
    what the appellant calls “the whims of the individual owners to use them or
    change them as they might desire.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission.  The application judge did not limit his
    analysis to just the dictionary definitions of the words “addition”,
    “alteration” and “improvement”.  Rather,
    he stated that “I must expand on each definition because each of the three key
    words in s. 98 must be interpreted in the context of the condominium property.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the integrity of the common elements of
    a condominium complex is an important feature of the structure and content of
    the <i>Condominium Act</i>.  However, an equally important feature of the <i>Act</i> is the rights of the owners.  This twin focus of the <i>Act</i> was well-described by Finlayson J.A. of this court in <i>Re Carleton Condominium Corp. No. 279 and
    Rochon</i> <i>et al.</i> (1987), 59 O.R.
    (2d) 545 at 549-50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <i>Condominium
    Act</i> was passed to permit individuals to be owners of the freehold estate in
    residential units in a building as opposed to tenants in an apartment
    building.  This means that they have disposable
    real property which is an investment and not simply an expense.  Its purchase can be financed by mortgage or
    lien in the same manner as any piece of real estate.  The unit owners are tenants in common and
    have all the rights of any owner of land within the description of their unit
    (s. 1(1)(<i>q</i>) and (<i>z</i>)).  By the nature of the
    building, there are certain “common elements” which are defined by s. 1(1)(<i>g</i>) as “all the property except the
    units”.  It is therefore necessary that
    there be detailed agreements with respect to the maintenance, operation and
    occupation of these common elements so that the responsibilities and privileges
    of each unit owner are clearly established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge’s interpretation of
    s. 98(1) of the <i>Act</i> strikes an
    appropriate balance between the rights of individual owners and the rights of
    the owners collectively speaking through their board of directors.  The appellant’s definition of the three key
    words of s. 98(1), anchored in the shared thread of “change” is, as discussed
    above, both semantically unpersuasive and overly broad.  The application judge’s interpretation,
    linking “addition” and “alteration” to connections or changes to the structure
    of the condominium unit and linking “improvement” to bettering the value, not
    just the enjoyment, of the property, strikes me as a balanced interpretation of
    the provision consistent with this court’s description of the <i>Act</i> in <i>Rochon</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not to say that the application judge’s
    definition of “addition”, alteration” and “improvement” can resolve every case
    where a s. 98(1) issue arises.  Indeed,
    the application judge recognized this: “I note that it is possible for a large
    freestanding item to become an addition, alteration or improvement if it were
    so large and so difficult to move that it becomes a permanent part of the
    property, but that is not the case here.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge’s definitions of the
    three key words in s. 98(1) of the <i>Act</i> provide a valuable starting point that should focus the inquiry and resolve
    most cases.  It resolves this case – both
    visually and legally, the hot tub is similar to the barbecue and picnic
    table.  If the approval of the board of
    directors is not required for the barbecue and picnic table, then it should not
    be required for the hot tub.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, there will be cases where the application
    judge’s definition will not work.  The
    size and difficulty of moving an object, as mentioned by the application judge,
    might lead to a different result.  To
    this I would add the possibility that a qualitative assessment of an object an
    owner might want to place on the patio might also lead to a different result –
    for example, an owner could not hope to store scores of disused and ugly tires,
    or ugly rusting equipment or vehicles, or a giant ugly billboard of the New
    York Yankees World Series team on his patio without obtaining the approval of
    the board of directors of the condominium corporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, each case will have to be decided on its
    own facts.  For now, though, I would say
    that the application judge’s interpretation of the key words of s. 98(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i> is a good one.  It will resolve most, but not all,
    cases.  It resolves this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>Section
    8(d) of the condominium corporation’s Declaration</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the application judge erred
    in not finding that the installation of the hot tub was contrary to s. 8(d) of
    the corporation’s Declaration, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8(d)<i>     </i>No owner shall make any structural
    change or alteration in or to his unit including the removal and installation
    of toilet, bath tub, wash basin, sink, heating, air condition, plumbing or
    electrical installation contained in or part or his unit; or alter the exterior
    design or colour of part of his unit where such change, alteration, decoration
    or painting is normally visible from the exterior thereof or make any change to
    an installation upon the common elements, or maintain, decorate, alter or
    repair any part of the common elements, except for the maintenance of those
    parts of the common elements which he has the duty to maintain without the
    prior consent in writing of the Board, which may attach any reasonable
    condition to its consent or which may in its discretion withhold its consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the installation of the hot
    tub was contrary to s. 8(d) of the Declaration in two respects: first, it
    caused an alteration of an electrical installation contained in McMahon’s unit
    by hard-wiring the hot tub to the electrical panel in his basement; and second,
    it caused an alteration to his common element back yard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge did not discuss this issue in his
    reasons.  I suspect that is because the
    first argument was almost invisible at the hearing (it appears to have been
    mentioned only in a footnote in paragraph 71 of the appellant’s factum) and
    because the second issue, anchored in the word “alteration”, traversed the same
    ground as the <i>Condominium Act</i> s.
    98(1) issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I do not accept the appellant’s
    submissions on this issue.  There is
    insufficient evidence to determine whether the very minor electrical adjustment
    necessary to hook up the hot tub amounts to a “structural change or alteration”
    of the electrical system in the unit.  Moreover, the evidence was that barbecues are permitted, without the approval
    of the board of directors, in the condominium complex.  Some of the barbecues would require minor
    adjustments to the unit to connect the gas line.  I do not see a difference between this
    permitted alteration and the alteration required to hook up the hot tub.  Finally, with respect to the appellant’s
    second argument on this issue, I see no reason to interpret the phrase “alter
    …any part of the common elements” in s. 8(d) of the Declaration different from
    the phrase “alteration …to the common elements” in s. 98(1) of the <i>Condominium Act.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make one other comment on this issue.  There is, potentially, a different route open
    to a condominium corporation to make some of the difficult balancing choices in
    a condominium complex.  Section 58(1) of
    the <i>Condominium Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>58.(1) The board may make, amend or repeal rules
    respecting the use of common elements and units to,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) promote the safety,
    security or welfare of the owners and of the property and assets of the
    corporation; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) prevent unreasonable
    interference with the use and enjoyment of the common elements, the units or
    the assets of the corporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting pursuant to this provision, the appellant has
    promulgated <i>Rules and Regulations
    respecting the Units</i>.  These rules,
    in their current form, prohibit absolutely, or permit but only with the
    approval of the board of directors, the placement of a wide variety of items on
    the common elements of the condominium complex – debris, refuse or garbage;
    coal or any combustible or offensive goods; motor vehicles (other than a
    private passenger automobile or station wagon), camper vans, trailers, boats, snowmobiles,
    mechanical toboggans, machinery or equipment of any kind; buildings,
    structures, tents or trailers; bicycles, tricycles, barbecues and toys when not
    in use; animals, livestock, fowl, birds, insects, reptiles or pets of any kind;
    fencing or landscaping.  Without passing
    judgment on whether the prohibition of hot tubs from the common elements of a
    condominium complex would, if challenged, be held to come within s. 58(1) of
    the <i>Act</i>, I simply observe that s. 58(1)
    and a board of director’s rule-making power provide a potential route to strike
    the desired balance with respect to usage of the common elements of a
    condominium complex.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        (3) <u>Sections 116 and 117 of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i></u><i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the application judge erred
    by not concluding that the installation of the hot tub contravened ss. 116 and
    117 of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, which
    provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>116. An owner may make reasonable use of the common
    elements subject to this Act, the declaration, the by-laws and the rules.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>117. No person shall permit a condition to exist or
    carry on an activity in a unit or in the common elements if the condition or
    activity is likely to damage the property or cause injury to an individual.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the installation of
    McMahon’s hot tub was an unreasonable use of the common elements because there
    were no other hot tubs in the condominium complex.  The appellant also submits that the installation
    was a dangerous activity because the hot tub was hard-wired to McMahon’s
    electrical panel by a person who was not an electrician.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge did not discuss these submissions
    in his reasons.  Again, I suspect that is
    because the submissions were almost invisible at the hearing, being raised in a
    single paragraph with one footnote containing unsubstantiated factual
    assertions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I do not accept the appellant’s
    submissions on this issue.  If it is not
    unreasonable to have barbecues or patio furniture on owners’ exclusive use
    common elements, then there is no reason why a hot tub should be regarded as
    unreasonable.  There is also nothing in
    the record to support a contention that the installation of McMahon’s hot tub
    created a dangerous condition or activity.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E. DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed that the question of costs should be
    left until the result of the appeal was known.  The respondent shall file his costs submission within seven days of the
    release of these reasons.  The appellant
    shall file its response within a further seven days.</p>

    award of $3400 to the respondent.  The
    appellant, appropriately, did not pursue this issue at the appeal hearing.</p>
