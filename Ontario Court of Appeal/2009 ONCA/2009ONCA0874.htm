    offences in issue arose out of the same incident. The murder count related to
    the shooting death of Joines Connolly; the attempted murder count related to
    the non-fatal shooting of Andres Sotomayor. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At
    the time of the shootings, Connolly and Sotomayor were at a neighbourhood bar,
    seated around a table with their mutual friend Nikita Mazur. Mazur was not
    injured in the gun fire, and he and Sotomayor provided identification evidence
    implicating the appellant as the shooter. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sotomayor’s
    evidence was given in the normal course. Mazur’s evidence, however, took the
    form of an audio recording of his testimony from the appellant’s preliminary
    inquiry – the reason being that he had moved to the Ukraine and was not
    available to testify at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mazur’s
    evidence is central to the appellant’s appeal. It gives rise to the following
    two issues: </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO> <span
lang=EN-US>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>Was the audio recording of Mazur’s
    testimony at the preliminary inquiry admissible at trial? </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO> <span
lang=EN-US>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US> If so, should it have attracted a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning? </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge admitted Mazur’s evidence under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal Code</i></span>, R.S.C. 1985, <span class=GramE>c</span>.
    C-46.<span lang=EN-US> That provision provides
    that where evidence is given by a witness in the presence of the accused on the
    preliminary inquiry into the charge, and facts are proved on oath from which it
    can be inferred reasonably that the witness is absent from Canada, the previous
    testimony may be admitted as evidence at the accused’s trial unless the <i>accused proves that he or she did not have
    full opportunity to cross-examine the witness</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits that s. 715 was unavailable in respect of Mazur’s evidence
    because he did not have full opportunity to cross-examine Mazur. Alternatively,
    he submits that the trial judge should have exercised her residual discretion
    under s. 715 to exclude Mazur’s evidence because its admission, in the
    circumstances, rendered his trial unfair. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown disagrees with the appellant and submits that the trial judge made no
    error in her interpretation of s. 715 or in her reasons for admitting Mazur’s
    evidence under it. Alternatively, the Crown submits that if Mazur’s evidence
    was not admissible under s. 715, it was admissible under the principled
    approach to the admission of hearsay evidence – a proposition which the
    appellant refutes. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As
    for the <i>Vetrovec</i> issue, the appellant
    submits that if Mazur’s evidence was admissible, the trial judge should have
    given a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation
    to it because Mazur was an important Crown witness and his evidence suffered
    from many credibility problems. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown disagrees and submits that the appellant’s failure to ask for a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is fatal to the
    position he now advances for the first time on appeal. Regardless, the Crown maintains
    that the trial judge thoroughly instructed the jury on the frailties associated
    with Mazur’s evidence, along with the need to approach it with care and
    caution, and submits that nothing more was required in the circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For
    reasons that follow, I am satisfied that Mazur’s evidence from the preliminary
    inquiry was admissible and properly received. I am further of the view that the
    trial judge was not obliged to provide the jury with a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning in relation to it. The only other ground of appeal
    relates to an item of evidence that the trial judge left with the jury as potentially
    confirmatory of Sotomayor’s testimony. In oral argument, counsel for the
    appellant, Ms. McArthur, fairly conceded that there was much less to this
    ground of appeal than she had originally anticipated. I agree. Standing alone,
    it could not possibly result in a successful appeal, regardless of its merit. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal from conviction. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW OF FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Because
    the issues on appeal are narrow and focus essentially on Mazur’s evidence, I
    propose to limit my review of the facts to a brief overview, adding detail where
    necessary to flesh out a particular ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On
    August 30, 2005, at approximately 11:50 p.m., Andres Sotomayor, Joines Connolly
    and Nikita Mazur were seated in the patio area of D’Martini’s, a bar in Mississauga,
    awaiting the arrival of Tony Calvo. Sotomayor and Calvo had been long time
    friends and business associates in the drug trade. Earlier that day, however,
    they had come to blows over Sotomayor’s belief that Calvo was sleeping with
    Sotomayor’s ex-wife, Erica. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    altercation took place in Calvo’s apartment. It was observed by Mazur, who had
    met his friend Sotomayor and accompanied him to Calvo’s apartment. Mazur
    interceded and broke up the fight. In the course of the altercation, Sotomayor
    demanded the repayment of $4,000 in drug money that Calvo owed him and the
    return of $15,000 worth of cocaine and 800 ecstasy pills. Calvo gave him $200
    which was all the money he had on hand. Sotomayor also told Calvo that he could
    no longer sell drugs in the Peel area. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After
    Mazur had interceded, he suggested that Calvo and Sotomayor speak directly to Erica
    and the three men left Calvo’s apartment. When Sotomayor and Mazur entered the
    elevator, Calvo took flight and succeeded in escaping. As Sotomayor and Mazur
    came out of the building, they saw Erica. She denied seeing Calvo or knowing
    his whereabouts. Sotomayor threatened her for sleeping with Calvo and then
    proceeded to slash two tires on Calvo’s car. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Upon
    leaving the building, Sotomayor and Mazur drove around looking for Calvo,
    without success. While still in the car, Sotomayor called Kurt Downer, a friend
    and drug-dealing associate, who was also a close friend of Calvo. Sotomayor
    told Downer about his falling out with Calvo but assured Downer that this had
    nothing to do with him. He also reached Calvo on the phone and he and Calvo
    traded threats. Mazur, who was seated beside Sotomayor in the car, described
    how Calvo and Sotomayor were yelling and screaming at each other and he
    overheard Sotomayor say: “if you want to <span class=GramE>fucking</span> bring
    it, bring it hard.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As
    the evening progressed, Sotomayor spoke again with Downer and arrangements were
    made for Sotomayor and Calvo to meet later that night to resolve their differences.
    Calvo was to pay back the money he owed to Sotomayor. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To
    that end, Sotomayor and Mazur drove to the Mississauga area. They met with
    their friend Joines Connolly and at about 10:00 p.m., they went to the parking
    lot of an apartment building where the rendezvous with Calvo was supposed to
    occur. When Calvo did not show up at the prearranged time, Sotomayor called
    Downer and was told that Calvo was having a hard time getting the money
    together. Sotomayor replied that he would wait for Calvo at D’Martini’s Bar.
    Sotomayor, Connolly and Mazur arrived at D’Martini’s at around 11:00 p.m. and
    took a table on the patio. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Shortly
    after their arrival, Sotomayor and Mazur noticed the appellant. He had parked
    his white Land Rover down the street and was walking up the wheel chair ramp
    leading into the bar. As he passed the Sotomayor group, who were seated beside
    the ramp, the appellant touched fists with them and then joined their table. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sotomayor
    knew the appellant. He had met him on about five prior occasions in the company
    of Downer. According to Sotomayor, the appellant and Downer were very close.
    The appellant’s white Land Rover was regularly parked at Downer’s residence and
    from what Sotomayor could make out, the appellant appeared to be Downer’s
    lackey. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mazur
    also recognized the appellant. He had seen him the previous night in the
    company of Downer and others. He and Sotomayor had met the Downer group on the
    street and they ended up giving Downer a ride home to his apartment at Kipling
    and Dundas. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>According
    to Sotomayor and Mazur, the appellant knew about the proposed meeting with
    Calvo and he made several phone calls and assured Sotomayor that Calvo would be
    there shortly. In the brief timeframe leading up to the shooting, the appellant
    got up from the table several times and was seen speaking on his cell phone. On
    two occasions, he returned to his white Land Rover. On the second occasion, he
    appeared to take something from the rear seat just before he started to walk
    back to the bar. At that time, another car pulled up. Sotomayor felt that
    something was wrong. Mazur heard him say “what the fuck is Snipes [Downer]
    doing here?<span class=GramE>”.</span> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sotomayor
    and Mazur then saw a man, believed to be Shimmiha Duhaney, a friend of Downer
    and Calvo, get out of the second car and run to the appellant’s white Land
    Rover. As Duhaney was entering the driver’s door, the appellant was proceeding
    up the wheel chair ramp. As he got close to the Sotomayor group, he pulled a
    gun from underneath the waistband of his pants and opened fire. In an effort to
    grab the gun from the appellant’s hand, Sotomayor pushed Mazur to the ground
    and leaped towards the appellant. It was then that he was struck by a bullet. Connolly
    was also shot and he eventually succumbed to his wounds after crawling inside
    the restaurant from the patio. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sotomayor,
    though wounded, went after the appellant, but could not see him. Mazur crawled
    inside the restaurant. He did not see the actual shooting or the shooter
    because Sotomayor had pushed him to the ground. He only saw the appellant
    coming towards them just before the shooting and heard a gun go off right
    behind his head. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A
    number of civilian witnesses saw a black man, dressed in black clothing, on the
    patio and inside portion of D’Martini’s around the time of the shooting. Some
    noticed he was constantly talking on a cell phone; others saw him shooting a
    gun from the wheel chair ramp. Their description of the shooter fit the
    description of the appellant given by Sotomayor and Mazur. Civilian witnesses
    also observed a white Land Rover speeding away from the scene moments after the
    shooting. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Cell
    phone records from the phones used by Sotomayor, Mazur, Downer, Duhaney and
    Calvo confirmed extensive contact between Sotomayor, Calvo and Downer in the
    aftermath of the afternoon confrontation between Sotomayor and Calvo at Calvo’s
    apartment. They also confirmed later contact between Downer, the appellant and
    Duhaney. In particular, between 10:00 and 11:49 p.m., there were 17 calls
    between Downer’s phone and the appellant’s phone, and 5 calls between the
    appellant’s phone and Duhaney’s phone. In the same timeframe, there were
    numerous calls between Sotomayor’s phone and Downer’s phone, and Sotomayor’s
    phone and Calvo’s phone. Importantly, in the immediate timeframe leading up to
    the shooting, all of the calls made from the phones associated with the
    appellant, Sotomayor, Downer and Duhaney registered on the cell towers closest
    to D’Martini’s. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It
    will be apparent from this summary that Mazur’s evidence, though not essential
    to the Crown’s case, was certainly of assistance. Mazur effectively shadowed
    Sotomayor on the day of the shooting and his evidence largely confirmed Sotomayor’s
    evidence as to the salient events. </span></p>

    August 31, 2005, the day following the shootings, Mazur was interviewed by the
    police. He claimed he had no involvement in the shootings and denied knowing
    the victims or the shooter. As he was leaving the police station, Mazur was
    apprehended and returned to the station. The police had learned that he and
    Sotomayor were friends and they wanted to know why he had denied knowing
    Sotomayor. Once again, Mazur claimed no involvement in, or knowledge of, the
    shootings. </span></p>

    September 9, 2005, the police took a third statement from Mazur in which he was
    somewhat more forthcoming but continued to minimize his involvement. By this
    time, the police had arrested and charged the appellant and Downer with the
    murder of Connolly, and the attempted murder of Sotomayor. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Thereafter,
    based on their continuing investigation, the police charged Mazur with robbery, <span class=GramE>arising</span> out of the altercation between Sotomayor and
    Calvo at Calvo’s apartment on the day of the shootings. Mazur received bail on
    the robbery charge and remained at large until March&nbsp;17, 2006, when he was
    arrested for breaching a condition of his release order. </span></p>

    his arrest on the breach charge, Mazur was detained at the Maplehurst
    Correctional Institute. He retained Mr. Dhaman Kissoon to represent him. One
    week later, on March 26, when Mr. Kissoon appeared for Mazur in bail court,
    Crown counsel advised that she would be opposing Mazur’s release on the breach
    charge and would be seeking to revoke and estreat his bail on the robbery charge. </span></p>

    is how matters stood when Mazur, on his own, without Mr. Kissoon’s knowledge or
    approval, contacted the officer in charge of the Connolly murder investigation
    and asked to see him at the Maplehurst Correctional Institute. At their meeting,
    which occurred on April 4, 2006, Mazur provided an audio-recorded statement in
    which he identified the appellant as the “trigger man” and recounted the events
    of August 29 and 30, 2005, beginning with his brief encounter with the
    appellant on the night of the 29th, and culminating in his description of the
    shootings at D’Martini’s on the night of the 30th. </span></p>

    weeks later, on May 3 and 4, 2006, Mazur testified at the appellant’s
    preliminary inquiry.  His evidence mirrored
    the contents of his April 4 statement. Additionally, for the first time, he
    selected the appellant as the person he believed had fired the shots. Prior to
    that, Mazur had not physically identified the appellant in a photo lineup or
    otherwise, even though on August 31, 2005, when he was first interviewed by the
    police, Mazur was shown a series of photographs that included the appellant.  He said nothing at the time because he wanted
    no involvement in the matter. On April 4, 2006, when he provided the police
    with an accurate account of the events, the police did not bring any
    photographs of the appellant with them. </span></p>

    April 26, some three weeks after Mazur had provided his April 4 <span
class=GramE>statement,</span> Mr. Kissoon appeared yet again in bail court and
    tried to persuade the Crown, Mr.&nbsp;Raftery, to agree to Mazur’s release on
    the breach charge. Mr. Raftery told Mr.&nbsp;Kissoon that he was aware of
    Mazur’s potential involvement as a witness in the Connolly murder. He said he
    wanted to speak to the investigating officer on that matter and would “consider
    bail depending on [that] discussion.” Mazur’s bail hearing was adjourned to the
    next day, at which time Mr. Raftery told Mr. Kissoon that he would “consider
    agreeing to bail for Mazur if Mazur testified at the appellant’s preliminary
    inquiry.” The bail hearing was accordingly adjourned to May 12, 2006 and in the
    interim, Mazur testified at the appellant’s preliminary inquiry. On May 12, the
    Crown consented to Mazur’s release on the breach charge. </span></p>

    to the commencement of the appellant’s preliminary inquiry, his counsel, Mr.
    Hinkson, had, with one exception, received disclosure of all of the pertinent
    information relating to Mazur. The disclosure included his various statements
    to the police, his criminal record, <span class=GramE>his</span> previous
    involvement with drugs, his outstanding robbery charge, for which he had received
    bail, and his outstanding breach charge, for which he was in custody, with the

    the possibility of Mazur’s release on the breach charge should he testify at
    the appellant’s preliminary inquiry. That information slipped through the
    cracks, in part it seems, because Mr. Raftery was not the Crown assigned to the
    appellant’s case and he did not conduct the preliminary inquiry. Be that as it

    is the background upon which the appellant rests his central submission that
    Mazur’s evidence should not have been received under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. In short, he submits that
    the Crown’s failure to disclose the pertinent discussions about the possibility
    of bail for Mazur’s testimony deprived him of information upon which he would
    have cross-examined Mazur had the Crown met its disclosure obligations. It
    follows, he submits, that he “did not have full opportunity to cross-examine”
    Mazur – a prerequisite to admissibility under s. 715. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Alternatively,
    the appellant submits that because he was denied the opportunity, through lack
    of disclosure, to cross-examine Mazur on a matter that went directly to Mazur’s
    credibility and provided him with a “powerful motive to lie”, the admission of
    Mazur’s evidence deprived him of a fair trial. As such, the trial judge should
    have exercised her residual discretion in his favour and ruled Mazur’s evidence
    inadmissible: see <i>R. v. Potvin</i>,

    the so-called “deal” could be brought to the attention of the jury through the
    evidence of Mr. Kissoon and possibly the officer in charge or the Crown in
    charge. She went on to state that it would be for the jury to decide the impact

    (3d) 185 (B.C.C.A.), the accused was charged with sexual assault and unlawful

    the morning of the preliminary inquiry, the complainant showed up in court, but
    left the building before the case was called. The investigating office located
    her and returned her to the Crown’s office, where she engaged in bizarre and threatening
    behaviour and had to be restrained in handcuffs. She was very distraught and made
    it known that she did not want to testify.  Her primary concern related to the length of
    time she would be on the stand. She did not want to stay long and it was
    self-evident that she was intent on obtaining some form of drug. </span></p>

    this, the Crown convinced the complainant to testify and she was cross-examined
    at length. In particular, she was questioned about her use of drugs and
    repeatedly confronted with the suggestion that her involvement with the accused
    on the day of the alleged offence was motivated by her need for drugs. Defence
    counsel, however, was unaware of the events that had transpired that morning in
    the Crown’s office.  He learned of them

    Crown counsel sought to have the complainant’s evidence from the preliminary
    inquiry introduced under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. The trial judge acceded to the Crown’s request. In doing so, he
    rejected defence counsel’s submission that, in the circumstances, the admission

    was convicted. On appeal, Hollinrake J.A., for the court, first observed that
    counsel on appeal (who was also defence counsel at trial) was not faulting the
    Crown for having failed to disclose the morning’s events before he began his
    cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry. No <i>malefides</i> on the part of the Crown was suggested. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Having
    made that observation, Hollinrake J.A. commenced his analysis by noting, at
    para. 18, that he did “not view this as a failure to disclose case.”  He then went on to find that in the
    circumstances, “the death of the complainant … left the appellant in the
    position, through no fault on the part of anyone, of not being able to exercise
    his constitutional right to full answer and defence.”  As such, he felt that it was incumbent on the
    trial judge, as a matter of principle, “<i>to
    exercise his discretion</i> under s. 715 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> against the admissibility of this evidence” (emphasis
    added). By way of explanation, he continued at paras. 18 and 19 as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    reach this conclusion because in my opinion this conduct of the <span
class=GramE>complainant  immediately</span> before giving her evidence was such as could have led to telling
    cross-examination of her on the issue of credibility which was the primary
    issue before the court. That was denied the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my opinion it is not enough to say that defence counsel conducted a thorough
    cross-examination of the complainant when the facts I have outlined above on
    the issue of credibility were unknown to him. <i>I have no hesitation in concluding that the absence of this knowledge
    on the part of defence counsel in this case amounted to a denial of the
    appellant’s right to full answer and defence rendering the trial an unfair one</i>.

    not determinative, Hollinrake J.A.’s analysis tends, in my view, to support the
    Crown’s position that the “full opportunity” requirement in s. 715 was not
    meant to apply to questions the defence would have asked had it been aware of
    information it should have received by way of disclosure. Were it otherwise, the
    court in <i>Barembruch</i> could have
    arrived at the conclusion it did by simply noting the non-disclosure, and finding
    that by reason of it, the accused did not have “full opportunity to
    cross-examine” the complainant. </span></p>

    said, I acknowledge that the argument in <i>Barembruch</i> was framed in terms of trial fairness and it may be reading too much into the

    am however, of the view, that the “trial fairness” approach used by the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal is the correct one. The single qualification I would
    make is that the Crown’s failure to disclose could, in my respectful view, be a
    factor for the trial judge to consider in assessing whether the proposed
    evidence should be excluded under s. 715 on grounds of trial fairness. On a
    close call, for example, the Crown’s failure to disclose might well tip the
    balance in favour of exclusion. Certainly, a flagrant and deliberate breach involving
    highly relevant information would be more serious than <span class=GramE>an
    inadvertent</span> one involving information of marginal relevance. </span></p>

    readily acknowledge that the “missing” information in Michaud had nothing to do
    with the Crown’s failure to disclose. It was discovered by the defence <i>after</i> the evidence, which the Crown

    and Michaud had gained entry into the victim’s home and while Albert did other

    he did not have “full opportunity to cross-examine” Albert because he was
    unaware of the recently discovered information that he could have used to
    impugn Albert’s credibility. Second, he claimed that, in the circumstances, having
    regard to the newly discovered evidence, the admission of Albert’s testimony
    rendered his trial unfair and, as such, the trial judge should have rejected it
    in the exercise of his residual discretion. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On
    that issue – whether Michaud did not have full opportunity to cross-examine
    Albert – Drapeau J.A. said the following at paras. 20 and 21 of his reasons: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    is settled law that s. 715 is not concerned with the fact of cross-examination
    but with the opportunity to cross-examine. See the annotation by Professor
    Delisle at (1986), 50 C.R. (3d) 193, and <i>R.
    v. Potvin</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 543. I venture to say that no
    cross-examination ever takes place in circumstances where counsel is fully
    aware of all the information that might prove useful in challenging the
    credibility of the witness. In my view, if this court were to adopt the
    restricted interpretation championed by Mr.&nbsp;Michaud, it would strip s.
    715(1) of any meaningful application; it is a result that is mandated neither
    by the terms <span class=GramE>employed by</span> Parliament nor by any binding
    authority. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As
    a general rule, an accused can successfully claim not to have had “full
    opportunity to cross-examine” within the meaning of s. 715 when the presiding
    judge deprived him or her of the right to counsel or curtailed
    cross-examination by the imposition of improper limitations or restrictions.
    See <i>R. v. Davidson</i> (1988), 42 C.C.C.
    (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), per Martin J.A. Now that <i>R. v. Potvin</i> has imported into s. 715(1) a residual discretion to
    exclude otherwise admissible prior testimony, there is no need to deform the
    expression “opportunity to cross-examine” by giving it a meaning that it cannot
    reasonably bear. As Justice Wilson explained in <i>Potvin</i>, at p. 547, “a denial or restriction [of cross-examination]
    can only have taken place if the intention or desire to pursue certain
    questions was present and was frustrated.” <i>In
    my view, an accused person’s ignorance of potentially useful information does
    not deprive him or her of “full opportunity to cross-examine” within the
    meaning of section 715(1).</i> [Emphasis added.] </span></p>

    identified the governing principles, Drapeau J.A. observed, at para. 23, that
    Michaud’s counsel had cross-examined Albert at length, both at the preliminary
    inquiry and the first trial, and there was no suggestion that his right of
    cross-examination had been “improperly restricted or limited”. It followed,
    according to Drapeau J.A. that: “… there is no merit to Mr. Michaud’s complaint
    that he did not have full opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Albert in the
    previous proceedings. Indeed, I am satisfied that Mr.&nbsp;Michaud was allowed
    to fully exercise his right of cross-examination ‘in the broad and generous
    manner befitting its constitutional status’”:  see <i>Potvin</i> at p. 544. </span></p>

    agree with Drapeau J.A.’s analysis and conclusion and find it apposite to the

    of the missing information and the Crown’s failure in the present case to meet
    its disclosure obligations. </span></p>

    both <i>Michaud </i>and the case at hand,
    defence counsel lacked information that might have proved useful in attacking
    the credibility of a witness whose evidence the Crown wished to introduce under
    s. 715. What differs is not “the fact” that relevant information was missing, but
    the reason for it. With that in mind, where the task at hand is to determine
    the meaning of the words “full opportunity” in s. 715, I find it incongruous to
    suggest that counsel for the appellant in the instant case did not have full
    opportunity to cross-examine Mazur, whereas counsel in Michaud did have full
    opportunity to cross-examine Albert. </span></p>

    better approach, in my view, is to limit consideration of the “full
    opportunity” requirement to cases where, for example, a witness refuses to
    answer questions in cross-examination, a witness dies or disappears in the
    midst of cross-examination, or where the presiding judge curtails
    cross-examination by imposing improper limitations or restrictions. It should <i>not</i> apply where the failure to cross-examination
    stems from an accused person’s ignorance of potentially useful information, no
    matter the cause or reason. Those situations, in my view, are best dealt with
    under trial fairness, where, as I have indicated, the reason for the missing information
    can properly be taken into account as a factor. </span></p>

    regardless of its degree of relevance or probity. Thus, for example, in Mazur’s
    case, failure to disclose an old conviction for impaired driving or common
    assault would, on the appellant’s thesis, be fatal to the admission of his
    evidence under s. 715.  I refuse to

    was extensively questioned over the course of two days. His cross-examination,
    which filled 138 pages of transcript, included everything from his criminal
    background and history, to his use of drugs, his purported ability to identify

    overnight to research the point before resuming his cross-examination of Mazur
    the following day. Second, he did not raise the so-called “restriction” before
    the trial judge as a basis for resisting the Crown’s application to have
    Mazur’s evidence from the preliminary inquiry introduced under s. 715. </span></p>

    “full opportunity” requirement in a way that would effectively emasculate
    s.&nbsp;715 in any case of non-disclosure, no matter the reason or the trivial
    nature of the missing information, so too, I reject an interpretation that
    would effectively stultify it in cases where erroneous evidentiary rulings of a
    non-jurisdictional nature have prevented cross-examination on isolated matters.
    This is to be contrasted with evidentiary rulings that, for example, place a

    were brought to the jury’s attention and it was for the jury to decide how, if
    at all, Mazur’s apparent disdain for authority and lack of trustworthiness
    impacted on his credibility. What the jury was missing was Mazur’s explanation
    for having committed the breach. That could only have inured to the appellant’s

    for the “bail for testimony” inducement, once again, the jury was made aware of
    all of the circumstances surrounding it, including its lack of formality and amorphous
    nature. While I do not doubt that it could have been the subject of
    cross-examination, it must be remembered that Mazur was cross-examined about
    his motivation for implicating the appellant as the shooter. The jury heard his
    explanations, which it could weigh against the backdrop of the “bail for
    testimony” inducement and Mazur’s failure to mention it. As with the
    circumstances surrounding the breach charge, what the jury lacked was Mazur’s
    explanation for not referring to it in his testimony. This too, could only have
    inured to the appellant’s benefit, especially since Mazur’s testimony tracked
    what he told the police on April 4, several weeks before the issue of “bail for
    testimony” had even been broached.  And
    while it is true that Mazur only physically identified the appellant for the
    first time at the preliminary inquiry, according to the investigating officer,
    he did so verbally in his April 4 statement. </span></p>

    that Mazur falsely identified the appellant at the preliminary hearing so that
    he could be released on bail and regain his freedom. The trial judge, in her

    following excerpts from defence counsel’s closing address are, in my view,
    instructive. They show how fully and effectively he was able to use the “bail
    for testimony” inducement as a basis for impugning Mazur’s testimony: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>August
    31st up to September 9th he never saw – didn’t know who the shooter is.  April 4th, 2006 he has a revelation. But we
    know from the testimony of his lawyer, Mr. Kissoon, that on March 16th, 2006,
    Nikita Mazur is arrested for fail to comply. So when he speaks to the police on
    April 4th, 2006, Nikita Mazur is in custody. He’d been there since March 16th of
    that same year. So beforehand he’s out of custody, last statement he’s in
    custody. We know from his lawyer, Mr. Kissoon, that Nikita Mazur had a problem
    with bail. He couldn’t get bailed out because the Crown was opposed to his
    release on fail to comply charges. His mother was not acceptable as a surety.
    The Crown wanted to take away, forfeit the money posted for bail and they
    wanted to cancel the bail for the robbery charge. In other words, Nikita Mazur
    was not going anywhere in terms of bail as of March 16th, 2006. He was stuck in
    custody. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>So
    what did Mr. Mazur do? He then makes contact with the police. He says he wants
    to clear his conscience. A conscience which didn’t need to be cleared before
    when he was out of custody, all of a sudden it needed to be cleared now when in
    custody. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A
    statement was taken April 4, 2006, and doesn’t result in Mr.&nbsp;Mazur being
    released from custody though. And you can understand that because prior to [that]
    he had given three different statements to the police where he lies. So as of
    April&nbsp;4th he gives a new statement to the police, he’s not released from
    custody. But that changes though, however, when he has – his lawyer has a
    discussion with the Crown Attorney, Mr. Rafferty, from my friend’s office here. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Rafferty had a discussion with Mr. Kissoon and a discussion about what could
    happen if Mr. Mazur testifies at the preliminary enquiry of Mr. Lewis. Mr.
    Rafferty would communicate with the officer in charge of the case and see what
    could be possibly, no guarantees, about bail for Mr.&nbsp;Mazur if he
    testified. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    bail hearing of Mr. Mazur is adjourned until after the preliminary enquiry of
    Mr. Lewis. Mr. Mazur comes to court and testifies against Mr. Lewis. Subsequent
    to him testifying he goes back to court and low and behold, he’s granted bail. <span
class=GramE>More than just a coincidence.</span> So what is it that was so
    significant with the testimony of Mr. Mazur at the preliminary enquiry of Imo Lewis
    that awards him being released from custody? What testimony that was given on
    April 4th or statement that was given on April 4th that’s so different? </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Well,
    according to Mr. Mazur, who is now freeing his conscience, he now knew who that
    person was that did the shooting at D’Martini’s on April (sic) 30th that night.
    He indicates that the person that did the shooting was Mr. Lewis. He indicates
    that he lied beforehand, didn’t want to get involved, and then he goes further
    and says, yes, I, he did the shooting and I met him the night before, August 29th.
    The shooting takes place on the 30th. I met this guy the night before. I’ve
    only met him once, never met him before. How convenient. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Nikita
    Mazur throughout the whole process lies, lies, lies. In fact, he states he is

    these reasons, I reject the appellant’s argument that the trial judge should
    have exercised her residual discretion under s. 715 and refused to admit
    Mazur’s testimony on grounds of trial fairness.  Indeed, I do not see this case as a close call,
    and certainly not one in which the Crown’s failure to disclose should tip the
    scales in favour of exclusion. The admission of Mazur’s evidence did not, in my

    issue arises here about the necessity component.  Mazur returned to the Ukraine after the
    preliminary inquiry and he was unavailable to testify at trial. The admission
    of his evidence therefore turns on the reliability component, which in this

    At para. 79, the court observed that “the surrounding circumstances of such
    testimony, particularly the presence of an oath or affirmation and the
    opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination, more than adequately

    case in the sense that G., the witness whose testimony the Crown wished to
    tender, was Hawkins’ girlfriend at the time of the preliminary inquiry and his
    wife at the time of trial. Hence, given the nature of the charges against
    Hawkins (police corruption)<span class=GramE>,</span> G. could not be called by

    the Supreme Court, in holding that her evidence from the preliminary inquiry

    that Hawkins could call G. as his witness at trial, presumably in the

    him but not the Crown. There was little prospect that Mazur would have recanted
    or given evidence helpful to the appellant and if the purpose of calling him
    was to explore the alleged “bail for testimony” inducement, that would have
    been a risky business indeed. Mazur’s testimony, it will be recalled, tracked
    the substance of his April 4 statement – a statement that he had given to the
    police voluntarily, without counsel’s knowledge, and more importantly, without
    there being a hint of bail in return. Cross-examination designed to show that
    to secure his release, Mazur had come to court and falsely implicated the
    appellant as the shooter would have proved difficult, given that Mazur’s
    testimony mirrored what he had said in his April 4 statement when the matter of

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE TWO: WAS A <i>VETROVEC</i> WARNING ESSENTIAL IN RELATION
    TO MAZUR’S EVIDENCE?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits that a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was essential in Mazur’s case and that the trial judge’s failure to
    give it constituted reversible error. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I
    disagree. Mazur was an important Crown witness, but his evidence was not
    critical to the Crown’s case. Sotomayor’s evidence bore that burden and the
    trial judge quite properly gave the jury a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation to it, as requested by defence counsel. Mazur’s evidence
    played a supportive role. Defence counsel, after considering the matter, did
    not ask the trial judge to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation to Mazur. In this regard, while the trial judge may have
    expressed her personal view against such an instruction, she left the matter
    entirely in defence counsel’s hands.  Given the fair and balanced manner in which the trial judge conducted
    the trial as a whole, I strongly expect that she would have acceded to defence
    counsel’s request had he made it clear that he wanted a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning in relation to Mazur. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>But defence counsel made no such
    request. Presumably, he did not see a need for a <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction. He was obviously content with the cautionary
    instructions the trial judge was prepared to give in relation to Mazur, short
    of a full blown <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. The
    trial judge did not second guess defence counsel’s decision; nor would I. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge carefully reviewed
    the various frailties associated with Mazur’s evidence, including his prior
    convictions, his involvement with drugs, and his prior inconsistent statements.
    She made special note of the fact that the jury had not seen him testify and she
    devoted a full page and a half to his outstanding charges of robbery and breach
    of bail, as well as the incentive he may have had, because of those charges, to
    testify “favourably” for the Crown.  In
    that regard, she specifically warned the jury of the need to approach his
    evidence “with care and caution.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>In the circumstances, it is apparent
    that defence counsel made a conscious, and in my view, reasonable decision not
    to ask for a <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction. He
    effectively got the best of both worlds. The jury was alerted to the pitfalls
    in Mazur’s evidence and warned of the need to proceed with care and caution.
    They were not alerted to the many items of evidence that were capable of
    confirming Mazur’s evidence, which would have been the case had a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning been given. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>In sum, defence counsel was in the
    best position to gage the need for a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning and he chose not to ask for one. The trial judge gave effect to his
    decision and made no error in doing so. Her charge was a model of fairness and
    it provided the jury with the tools it needed to properly assess the worth of
    Mazur’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>I would accordingly reject this
    ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE THREE: DID THE TRIAL
    JUDGE IMPROPERLY LEAVE A PORTION OF MAZUR’S EVIDENCE AS POTENTIALLY
    CONFIRMATORY OF SOTOMAYOR’S TESTIMONY?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>The appellant submits the trial
    judge erroneously instructed the jury that Mazur’s evidence about a number of
    phone calls between Sotomayor and Downer, in which the two men were trying to
    arrange for Calvo to deliver money to Sotomayor, was evidence capable of
    confirming Sotomayor’s testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>To the extent that Mazur was not
    privy to these calls and was only reporting what Sotomayor told him, the
    appellant’s point is valid. That said, the error in my view was harmless and
    could not possibly have altered the verdict. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>Apart from this one item of
    evidence, the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the wide body of
    evidence that was capable of confirming Sotomayor’s testimony. There was a
    wealth of such evidence in this case, including the evidence linking the
    appellant to the white Land Rover that was seen fleeing from the scene. The
    trial judge did not mention that evidence to the jury. She could have, and it
    would have been a powerful substitute for the evidence about which the
    appellant complains. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>In the end, the impugned instruction
    resulted in no significant prejudice to the appellant, especially here, where
    the evidence implicating him as the shooter was very powerful. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span

    to this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>The appellant had a fair trial. The
    trial judge correctly received Mazur’s testimony from the preliminary inquiry
    and she was not required to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation to it. The one error relating to confirmatory evidence was
    harmless and could not possibly have affected the result. I would accordingly
    dismiss the appellant’s appeal from conviction. </span></p>
