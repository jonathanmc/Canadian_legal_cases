style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent pled guilty to conspiracy to traffic
    in cocaine.  He received a sentence of
    two years less one day to be followed by 30 months probation.  The trial judge also gave the respondent
    12-months’ credit for the six months he spent in pre-trial custody.  In effect, the respondent received a jail
    sentence of three years less one day.  The
    Crown seeks leave to appeal from that sentence and submits that a sentence of
    five to seven years should have been imposed in the circumstances of the
    case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent’s arrest came as a result of a
    lengthy joint task force operation involving the Ottawa Police Department and
    the Ontario Provincial Police.  That
    investigation uncovered a cocaine distribution network operating within
    Ottawa.  Large quantities of cocaine were
    brought into Ottawa from Montreal and Toronto by two different distributing
    arms of the illegal operation.  The
    respondent and three others formed one of those distribution arms.  The distributors brought cocaine in at the
    kilogram level and distributed it within Ottawa at the multi-ounce level.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Private communications were intercepted in the
    course of the investigation.  According
    to the agreed statement of facts filed on the respondent’s guilty plea, the
    intercepted communications, “demonstrate that the conspiracy group with which
    Mr. Majnoon [the respondent] is a part was a highly commercialized and
    organized group which was bringing multiple kilos of cocaine [per] month to Ottawa
    and distributing the same.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was acknowledged in the agreed statement of
    facts that the respondent travelled to Montreal on at least two occasions and returned
    to Ottawa with kilogram-level shipments of cocaine.  It was also agreed that he continued to work
    for the distribution arm even after certain drugs were seized from him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wiretaps provided evidence that the
    respondent discussed and negotiated pricing with others within the distribution
    arm.  There was also evidence that he
    quoted a price of $30,000 per kilogram to a prospective buyer.  The buyer responded about four minutes later
    indicating that the price was “not <span class=GramE>bad”,</span> and inquiring
    whether the respondent had the cocaine.  The respondent replied that he was getting more tomorrow and referred to
    the significant police presence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In fixing the respondent’s role in the
    substantial drug trafficking operation revealed in the agreed statement of
    facts, the trial judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Most
    significantly in my view, the conduct in which he was involved was as a courier
    of drugs.</i>  And that is to say, he was
    operating at a low level and I think that’s evidenced by the agreed statement
    of facts and all of the wiretaps which were submitted in this case.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>He was
    transporting cocaine at the kilo level.</i>  That is to say, he was in terms of the gravity of his conduct, he was
    sort of right in the middle, not at the lowest, not at the highest, but he was
    transporting at the kilo level.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The limited circumstances in which this court
    can interfere with sentences imposed at trial are well known and need not be
    repeated here.  I would not interfere
    with the sentence imposed by the trial judge if he was correct in describing
    the respondent’s role in this operation as that of a “courier” or
    “transporter”.  I must, however, agree
    with the Crown’s submission that the respondent played a more significant role
    than that of a mere courier.  In addition
    to transporting large amounts of cocaine between Montreal and Ottawa, the
    respondent was involved in negotiating prices at the multi-kilo level and on at
    least one occasion offered to sell cocaine at the multi-kilo level.  He had an interest in the operation that went
    beyond whatever compensation he received for carrying the drugs from one place
    to another.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was not at or near the top of the
    hierarchy of this drug operation.  He was
    not, however, simply a “courier” who moved narcotics from Montreal to Ottawa.  Having regard to the role played by the
    respondent in the operation, I think he is more properly seen as a person
    involved not only in the transportation of kilograms of cocaine, but in the distribution
    of the drug at that level.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having regard to the actual role played by the
    respondent in the conspiracy and taking into account the aggravating and
    mitigating factors identified by the trial judge, a sentence in the range
    suggested by the Crown at trial (five to seven years) would have been appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We were told that the respondent was released on
    parole in early October.  This appeal was
    originally scheduled to be heard in the summer, but was adjourned at the
    respondent’s request.  Obviously, had it
    proceeded as scheduled, the problem of re-incarcerating the respondent if the
    appeal was allowed would not have arisen.  In my view, the court must be very careful about treating
    re-incarceration as a significant factor in its assessment of a Crown appeal
    when it is clear that but for the respondent’s request for an adjournment, the
    appeal would have been heard and determined before the respondent was
    released.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I think five years would have been the
    appropriate sentence at trial.  Like the
    trial judge, I would give the appellant 12 months’ credit for his pre-trial
    custody, yielding an actual sentence of four years.  I would vary the sentence to four years.  To avoid any uncertainty,  I wish to make it clear that the respondent
    should receive credit against that four years for the time spent in custody
    between the imposition of sentence in February of this year and his release on
    parole in October of this year.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would grant leave to appeal the sentence
    imposed, allow the appeal and vary the sentence in accordance with these
    reasons.  If necessary, a warrant may
    issue for the respondent’s arrest.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a Crown appeal against sentence following a
    guilty plea. The basis for the appeal is that the sentencing judge
    misapprehended the facts of the offence and therefore imposed a sentence that
    was outside the range for the offence. I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A sentencing judge is entitled to significant deference
    not only with respect to the sentence imposed, but also the findings of fact
    regarding the offence: <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i>,
    [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 91; <i>R.
    v.  R.E.M</i>., [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3. In <i>R. v. Grant</i>, [2009] S.C.J. No. 32, at
    para. 129, the Supreme Court reiterated that “the trial judge’s underlying
    factual findings must be respected, absent palpable and overriding error.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the guilty plea was based on an agreed
    statement of facts that included transcriptions of a number of wiretapped
    conversations among the conspirators. Crown and defence counsel at trial
    diverged significantly on the range of sentence and on <span class=GramE>the  importance</span> of the respondent’s role in
    the context of the relevant case law. The evaluation of that role was open to
    interpretation, and it was the function of the sentencing judge to consider the
    record and make his finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the reasons for sentence that the
    sentencing judge was fully familiar with the record and did not misapprehend
    the evidence. He stated on page 1 of his oral reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An agreed statement of fact has been filed as
    exhibit number 1 in this case. I have heard very lengthy submissions from both
    sides, the submissions, indeed, which took the better part of a day. And I have
    reviewed voluminous material and case law which was presented to me. This
    necessitated my reserving on the matter overnight to refresh my memory with
    regard to the notes I had taken of the submissions and to review some of the
    case law to which I have been referred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And later on page 4, when addressing the role of the
    respondent, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear upon reviewing the statement of fact in
    this case, which I had an opportunity again to do last <span class=GramE>night,
    that</span> the accused was, shall we say, knowledgeable and plugged into the
    system. He knew the lingo, he knew the code talk, probably suspected that they
    were being wiretapped or that their calls were being intercepted – this was all
    on cell phone. And I think that does contribute to the position expressed by
    the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge found that the respondent’s role
    was as a courier at the mid-level. In so finding, he understood that the
    respondent was not a mere “mule” who delivered drugs and followed instructions.
    He collected money and dealt with the principals; he knew the lingo; he was
    trusted with over a kilo of cocaine. Although he was involved in the
    distribution, he was not the head of the group. That was another man identified
    in the agreed statement, named James Kongkhaw. The sentencing judge
    characterized the respondent as transporting at the kilo level and that “in
    terms of the gravity of his conduct, he was sort of right in the middle, not at
    the lowest, not at the highest”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in characterizing the respondent as a
    courier and a transporter at the kilo level, the sentencing judge fully
    understood that he played an active role in the drug distribution but not a
    leadership role. As a result, the sentencing judge’s evaluation of the
    respondent as operating at a middle level was not unfair and was open to him as
    the basis for imposing sentence in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was alive to all of the
    aggravating and mitigating factors, which he discussed. He had determined that
    the respondent’s prospects for rehabilitation were good in this case and should
    be featured as an important factor in the sentence of this relatively young
    first offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this is the very type of case where an
    appeal court is to give deference to the sentencing judge, who has dealt
    directly with the parties and knows the record, the community and the law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
