  </span> The appellants challenge the accounting in the sum of $364,266.92 and 
  the punitive damages award in the sum of $50,000 ordered against them by the 
  trial judge.  </p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Among other matters, they assert that on a proper construction of the 
  evidence, no amounts are owed by the appellants to the respondent, that there 
  is no basis in this case for an award of punitive damages and that, on the case 
  as pleaded, the individual appellant cannot be held liable for any debt found 
  to be owing by the corporate appellant to the respondent.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We do not accept these arguments.  We conclude that the appeal must 
  be dismissed.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent, a creditor of Omnisales Inc. (“Omnisales”), had received 
  permission to continue an action against the appellants that had been instituted 
  by Omnisales in May 2003 before its bankruptcy in 2004.  The action sought an 
  accounting from both of the appellants of monies received and disbursed by them 
  on account of Omnisales, for the repayment of monies owed, for general damages 
  in the alternative and for punitive damages.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge held that both the corporate and individual appellants 
  had an obligation to provide the respondent with a complete and reliable accounting, 
  an obligation that they failed to discharge.  He further held that the appellants 
  made no effort to preserve the documents necessary to provide an accounting, 
  although they were obliged to do so.  Both of these critical findings were amply 
  supported by the evidential record, including the testimony of Mr. Armstrong 
  himself and that of the appellants’ accountant, Mr. Lowe.  For this reason alone, 
  there is no basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s findings about 
  the accounting.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nor are we persuaded that the trial judge erred by awarding punitive 
  damages in this case.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this record, it was open to the trial judge to hold that the appellants 
  stayed in possession of and continued to conduct Omnisales’ business without 
  authority to do so, particularly after October 30, 2002 when the debt owed to 
  the appellants had been paid in full.  This occurred against the backdrop of 
  the appellants charging Omnisales interest at rates that offended s. 347(1) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Pursuant to s. 347(2), “interest” includes the 
  aggregate of all charges and expenses and fees.  Although there is a dispute 
  as to whether the appellants ever sought to collect the interest charges, the 
  charges were imposed as a condition of the loans advanced.  This is sufficient 
  to support the trial judge’s holding on a civil standard that criminal rates 
  of interest were charged.  Together with other findings of the trial judge of 
  high-handed conduct, this was more than enough to ground the award of punitive 
  damages.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the counterclaim advanced by the appellants included claims 
  by Mr. Armstrong in his own interest as a creditor and shareholder of Omnisales.  
  There was also evidence before the trial judge indicating that Mr. Armstrong 
  had received funds in his personal capacity for the credit of Omnisales for 
  which he did not account and in respect of which he failed to maintain proper 
  records. </p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition, Mr. Armstrong is the admitted principal of the corporate 
  appellant.  His own conduct was called into question in this litigation and 
  it does not appear to have been denied that he directed the actions of the appellants, 
  at all material times.  Nor does it appear to have been argued at trial that 
  Mr. Armstrong was immune from personal liability on the ground that it was not 
  open to the trial judge to pierce the corporate veil of the corporate appellant 
  on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal is dismissed.  The costs of the appeal are awarded to the 
  respondent in the total amount of $23,669.93, inclusive of disbursements and 
  G.S.T.</p>
