<p class=HeadingNumber> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By reasons dated August 21, 2009, we allowed the appeals in this matter 
  in part, by setting aside the order of Wilton-Siegel J. of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated July 9, 2008, that had granted “<i>Norwich</i>” relief to 
  the respondent, GEA Group AG (“GEA”), based on the principles articulated in 
  <i>Norwich Pharmacal Co. v. Comrs. of Customs and Excise</i>, [1974] A.C. 133 
  (H.L.) (the “<i>Norwich</i> Order”).  In our reasons, we also: (1) awarded the 
  appellant, Flex-N-Gate Corporation (“FNG”), the costs of its appeal and of an 
  earlier stay motion before this court, in the total amount of $35,000, and (2) 
  awarded the appellants, Ventra Group Co. (“Ventra”) and Timothy Graham (“Graham”), 
  the costs of their appeal and of the stay motion, in the total amount of $22,000.</p>
<h2>1)        The December Order</h2>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our reasons, through inadvertence, we failed to confirm our decision 
  to set aside the order of P.A. Cumming J. of the Superior Court of Justice (the 
  “motion judge”), dated December 9, 2008 (the “December Order”) – the order from 
  which the appeals formally were launched.  As detailed in our reasons, we concluded 
  that GEA had failed to establish that <i>Norwich</i> relief is required in this 
  case.  It follows that neither the <i>Norwich</i> Order nor the December Order 
  can stand.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is appropriate, therefore, to amend paragraph 117 of our August 2009 
  reasons to indicate explicitly that, in addition to the <i>Norwich</i> Order, 
  the December Order is set aside and we so order.</p>
<h2>2)        Costs of Proceedings Below</h2>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following the release of our reasons, counsel for the parties wrote 
  to the court regarding the issue of the costs of the proceedings below that 
  eventually led to the December Order.  As a result of that correspondence, we 
  invited the parties’ written submissions concerning those costs.  We have now 
  received and reviewed those submissions.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The general rule is that costs follow the event on appeal.  However, 
  in our view, the unusual circumstances of this case justify a departure from 
  this rule.  We conclude that it is appropriate that no costs of the proceedings 
  in the Superior Court leading to the December Order be awarded to any party.  
  We reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, as GEA points out, <i>Norwich</i> orders are generally confidential, 
  of necessity.  But in this case, GEA consented to the disclosure of the <i>Norwich</i> 
  Order and of the <i>Norwich</i> proceeding to FNG, at Ventra’s and Graham’s 
  request.  On the record before us, this request and GEA’s associated consent 
  were forthcoming, at least in part, because Graham failed to answer certain 
  questions on his cross-examination on the affidavit he swore in support of Ventra’s 
  and Graham’s motion to set aside the <i>Norwich</i> Order on the ground that 
  the information sought had to be obtained from or on inquiry of FNG.  Ultimately, 
  an order was obtained from C. Colin Campbell J. of the Superior Court of Justice, 
  dated September 3, 2008, permitting disclosure to FNG on certain terms.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Not surprisingly, FNG thereafter became actively involved in the litigation.  
  It brought its own motion to set aside the <i>Norwich</i> Order, filed affidavit 
  and other materials for use on that motion and participated in the argument 
  of the motion.  While FNG was entitled to take these steps, its decision to 
  do so – rather than, for example, assisting Ventra and Graham with their pending 
  similar motion – necessarily delayed and prolonged the already complex pending 
  proceedings.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, although it is not entirely clear from this record, it is 
  not apparent to us that Ventra and Graham used any information obtained from 
  FNG after the September 2008 disclosure order to respond to the refusals on 
  Graham’s cross-examination.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the appellants’ argument before this court focused on the claim 
  that the information sought by GEA was not necessary to enable it to plead its 
  case.  This was not the appellants’ position before the motion judge.  On the 
  contrary, before the motion judge, FNG argued that GEA had no reasonable and 
  <i>bona fide</i> claim against it at all.  It did not assert, as it did in this 
  court, that GEA was already positioned to plead.  Ventra and Graham supported 
  FNG’s argument before the motion judge, as they did in this court.  They also 
  claimed before the motion judge that GEA had no substantial evidence of any 
  fraud.  This claim was not central to the appeals.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The matters raised on the appeals thus marked a significant shift in 
  the appellants’ positions and in the focus of their attacks on the <i>Norwich</i> 
  Order.  One consequence of this was that much of the evidential record from 
  the proceeding before the motion judge was not relied on by the appellants and 
  became essentially irrelevant for the purpose of the appeals.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is a third significant consideration.  The key issue raised by 
  the appellants on the appeals – the role of the necessity to plead as a criterion 
  under the test for a <i>Norwich</i> order – not only bore little, if any, relation 
  to the issues in play before the motion judge, it also involved questions of 
  unsettled law in Ontario.  The guidance which this court ultimately sought to 
  provide on the test for obtaining a <i>Norwich</i> order was not available previously 
  under existing jurisprudence.  Nor was it considered or developed before the 
  motion judge.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, with respect to FNG, it must be remembered that FNG has been 
  found by a final ruling of a German arbitral tribunal to have breached its contractual 
  obligations to GEA, for which FNG is liable in damages.  The entire litigation, 
  in Germany and in Ontario, arose from FNG’s conduct and that of its representatives.  
  Further, it appears that FNG remains indebted to GEA for an unsatisfied costs 
  order made in Germany in the amount of <span style='"Times New Roman"'>€</span>228,760.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In combination, all these factors militate against awarding any of the 
  appellants their costs of the proceedings below.  That said, the effect of our 
  decision is that the <i>Norwich</i> Order was unnecessary and should not have 
  been granted.  The latter factor compels the conclusion that no costs should 
  be awarded to GEA in respect of the proceedings below.</p>
<p class=HeadingNumber> [14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According, while our costs awards set out in our August 2009 reasons 
  regarding the appeals stand, there shall be no order in favour of any party 
  concerning the costs of the proceedings below.  To the extent that it may be 
  necessary to give effect to these reasons, we direct that the costs award made 
  by the motion judge be set aside.</p>
