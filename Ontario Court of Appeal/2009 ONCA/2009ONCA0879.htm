<h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario (The Ministry 
  of Transportation) (the “Crown”), appeals the decision of the Divisional Court 
  dated August 28, 2009 that granted an application brought by the respondents 
  (collectively, “Bot”) to quash the Ministry of Transportation’s (the “MTO”) 
  decision dated April 27, 2009 to award a major highway construction project 
  near Arnprior to Thomas Cavanagh Construction Ltd. (“Cavanagh”).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown appeals on four grounds: (1) the Divisional Court erred by 
  concluding that it had jurisdiction to judicially review the Crown’s procurement 
  decision; (2) the Divisional Court erred by concluding that Bot had a legitimate 
  expectation that was enforceable on an application under the <i>Judicial Review 
  Procedure Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. J. 1; (3) the Divisional Court erred by concluding 
  that the MTO’s decision declaring that Cavanagh’s bid was compliant with the 
  rules of the tendering process was unreasonable; and (4) the Divisional Court 
  erred by quashing the MTO’s procurement decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the appeal can and should be resolved solely on the basis 
  of the third ground of appeal, without expressing any view as to the other grounds.  
  We conclude, with respect, that the Divisional Court erred by holding that the 
  core of the MTO’s procurement decision – that Cavanagh’s bid was compliant – 
  was unreasonable.</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The MTO issued a Request for Tender for work to widen Highway 417 east 
  of Arnprior from two to four lanes of traffic, including the construction of 
  two bridges.  To comply with the MTO’s Steel Policy, the Tender required that 
  each bidder complete a Declaration of Declared Value of Imported Steel form 
  and a statement of the value of Canadian structural steel products supplied, 
  so that the MTO could apply a 10% preference for Canadian steel content to arrive 
  at each bidder’s “Adjusted Total Tender”.  The Tender did not require the Statement 
  of Canadian Steel Content form, which states that any steel statement that is 
  found to be incorrect will automatically disqualify the bid.  However, Stephen 
  Bot’s affidavit states that Bot’s prior experience with MTO suggests that this 
  is their practice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Cavanagh’s bid declared nil value for imported steel, so all of its 
  steel would be subject to the 10% price preference.  After bids closed on April 
  1, 2009, Cavanagh bid the lowest Total Tender and Adjusted Total Tender ($63,000,000 
  and $56,700,000) and Bot was the second lowest ($65,459,000 and $58,930,100).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before the MTO actually awarded the Contract, Bot submitted to the MTO 
  in two letters on April 2 and 7, 2009 that Cavanagh’s bid failed to declare 
  a value of imported steel, so its tender must be rejected as non-compliant because 
  the MTO’s design documents for the bridges called for steel that was only available 
  outside Canada.  After the MTO investigated and determined that Cavanagh’s bid 
  was compliant, Bot clarified its complaint in a letter, stating that the MTO 
  specified the use of “rolled steel beams”, which are not available in Canada, 
  for the “W” and “WT” dimensions of beam sections of the two bridges.  The MTO 
  investigated again and Cavanagh replied by stating that it intended to use only 
  Canadian steel and that Canadian steel welded to the same specified dimensions 
  as rolled steel would better meet the drawing specifications.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The MTO’s structural engineer was satisfied that welded beams would 
  meet the MTO’s requirements.  The MTO found Cavanagh’s bid to be compliant and 
  awarded the Contract to Cavanagh on April 27, 2009.  </p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before the Divisional Court and before this court, the parties agreed 
  that, if judicial review is available, the standard of review of the MTO’s decision 
  was reasonableness.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court understood the contents and implications of the 
  reasonableness standard of review.  Under the heading <i>Standard of Review</i>, 
  the court said:</p>
<p class=Doubleindent-quote>A reasonableness inquiry is concerned mostly with 
  the existence of justification, transparency, and intelligibility within the 
  decision-making process; it is also concerned with whether the decision falls 
  within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect 
  of the facts and law (<i>Dunsmuir</i>, para. 47).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court concluded that “[t]he MTO is entitled to considerable 
  deference in the determination of tender issues and its decision to award the 
  Contract.”  It also said that “[t]here is no suggestion that the MTO acted in 
  bad faith or for improper purposes.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the reasonableness inquiry before the Divisional Court 
  necessarily involved a determination of whether the MTO’s decision “falls within 
  a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the 
  facts and law” (<i>Dunsmuir</i>).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this issue, the crucial question was whether Cavanagh’s failure to 
  declare any imported steel content in its bid made its bid non-compliant because 
  the design drawings indicated that for parts of two bridges a relatively small 
  amount of rolled steel that could only be manufactured in the United States 
  was required.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court concluded that this posed an insurmountable problem 
  for Cavanagh’s bid:</p>
<p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he fact remains that rolled steel beams were specified 
  in the design drawings and the only evidence before us is that rolled steel 
  beams are not available in Canada.</p>
<p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, it is clear on the evidence that Cavanagh’s 
  bid could not possibly comply with a mandatory requirement as specified by the 
  MTO drawings.</p>
<p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the factual record before us, the MTO’s Decision 
  that the Cavanagh’s bid was compliant with the mandatory requirements and the 
  design specifications was not reasonable.  It could not possibly comply with 
  the specifications in view of Cavanagh’s declaration that it would be using 
  only Canadian-sourced steel.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, we do not accept this analysis.  Once the MTO was advised 
  by Bot about the potential non-compliance of Cavanagh’s bid, the MTO conducted 
  an investigation before awarding the Contract.  The MTO’s investigation established 
  several important facts.  Cavanagh said that the contents of its bid were honest 
  and accurate – it intended to use only Canadian steel in the project.  For the 
  beams on the two bridges, both American rolled steel and Canadian welded steel, 
  which Cavanagh intended to use, would meet MTO standards for structural strength 
  and performance.  The amount of steel required for the bridge beams was small 
  (1.14 per cent of the total steel required for bridges by the Contract) and 
  minor (0.26 per cent of the value of the Contract).  Cavanagh’s proposal to 
  use Canadian welded steel better accorded with an explicit Crown policy to use 
  Canadian steel.  Even if the use of Canadian steel required a change in the 
  project specifications, this change would be a minor one and would be readily 
  approved.  Finally, even if Cavanagh had declared imported steel for use on 
  the bridge beams, it would not have affected the order of bidders because of 
  the large gap ($2,259,000 in the total bids, $2,230,000 in the adjusted bids) 
  between Cavanagh, the lowest bidder, and Bot, the second lowest bidder.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following its investigation, the MTO declared Cavanagh’s bid compliant 
  and awarded it the Contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the investigative steps taken by the MTO after it received 
  Bot’s complaint satisfied any duty of fairness owed by the MTO to Bot and the 
  facts it discovered through the investigation provide a sufficient basis to 
  support a reasonable conclusion by the MTO that Cavanagh’s bid was compliant.  
  The MTO obviously took Bot’s complaint seriously and investigated it in a genuine 
  and diligent fashion.  And the constellation of facts it discovered removes 
  its ultimate decision from the realm of unreasonableness as defined in the case 
  law.  The decision that Cavanagh was compliant with the tender process fell 
  within “a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect 
  of the facts and law.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We make one final observation.  Before turning to its assessment of 
  the MTO’s decision in this case, the Divisional Court said this about the MTO 
  decision-makers:</p>
<p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he ministry personnel who select bids are highly 
  experienced in the road construction specification and in the public tender 
  process.  They support the Minister in fulfilling the broad mandate for road 
  construction under the <i>Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act</i>.  
  They operate a public tendering system expending millions, if not billions, 
  of dollars.  They pre-qualify vendors.  They are charged with complying with 
  the Directive for all tendering for Ontario’s road construction and maintenance.  
  They have considerable experience in the application of the administrative Directive 
  and the application of the Steel Policy.  The ministry determination of the 
  bid process or of bid compliance is inextricably intertwined with the facts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We agree with this description.  In our view, it must anchor a court’s 
  review of an MTO decision under the reasonableness standard of review.  In this 
  case, when one combines this description of the MTO decision-makers, the investigative 
  process followed by the MTO after it received Bot’s complaint, and the facts 
  elicited by the investigation, the judicial decision that must follow is that 
  the MTO’s decision that Cavanagh’s bid was compliant is reasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We emphasize that we come to this conclusion without expressing any 
  view as to the availability of judicial review as a remedy with respect to the 
  tendering process for government procurement contracts.</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal is allowed and the application for judicial review is dismissed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant is entitled to costs in the Divisional Court and this 
  court fixed at $35,000 in total, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  On a similar 
  basis, the respondent Cavanagh is entitled to costs fixed at $15,000.</p>
