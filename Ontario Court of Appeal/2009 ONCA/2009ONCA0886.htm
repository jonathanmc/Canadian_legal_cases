style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the Crown’s position that the fresh evidence should be
    admitted, the appeal allowed and an acquittal entered, we intend to provide
    only brief reasons.  This appeal originates in the reinvestigation of cases in
    which Dr. Charles Smith had provided opinions and evidence as to the cause of
    death of children.  In 1996, the appellant was charged with the first degree
    murder of her four month-old-son, Joshua.  At the same time, child protection
    officials took custody of her older son.  In 1999, she reached an agreement
    with the Crown that led to her conviction for infanticide.  Mr. Justice Byers
    sentenced the appellant to one year imprisonment.  She has long ago served that
    sentence.  Just prior to the sentencing, the appellant agreed to the adoption
    of her other son by the foster parents with whom the child had been living.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Smith performed the autopsy on Joshua and testified at the
    appellant’s preliminary inquiry.  He testified that Joshua died from asphyxia,
    probably as a result of suffocation or smothering by a third party. 
    Significantly, he also testified about other injuries to the infant that
    supported a finding of intentional killing, namely, haemorrhages in the neck
    tissues, a skull fracture and a healing fracture of the left ankle.  Based on
    this evidence, the appellant was committed for trial on the charge of first
    degree murder, later reduced to second degree murder as a result of a <i>certiorari</i> application</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just prior to trial, Crown counsel, not Mr. Shandler, agreed to withdraw
    the murder charge and lay a charge of infanticide.  In return, although she
    pleaded not guilty to the infanticide charge, the appellant agreed not to
    contest a set of facts that included an allegation that she smothered her
    child.  The facts also set out a summary of the evidence that Dr. Smith gave at
    the preliminary inquiry, including reference to the skull fracture and the
    fracture to the child’s ankle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has always maintained that she did not harm her child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, the Chief Coroner began a review of 45 cases in which Dr. Smith
    had provided an opinion or testified.  One of the cases to be reviewed was
    Joshua’s case.  As is well known, this review eventually led to the Inquiry
    into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in Ontario conducted by Justice Goudge of
    this court.  The findings by eminent pathologists and other experts
    demonstrated serious errors by Dr. Smith in many cases.  In Joshua’s case, the
    findings demonstrate that Dr. Smith’s opinion was wrong in several important
    respects.  The skull fracture was, in fact, a normal developing cranial
    suture.  The haemorrhages to the neck were, in fact, dissection-related
    artefacts from the autopsy itself.  As for the injury to the left ankle, the
    experts could say only that it could have been caused deliberately or accidentally. 
    The experts also state that other findings relied upon by Dr. Smith , the petechial
    haemorrhages and congestion of the lungs, are common findings in infant deaths
    and not diagnostic of an intentional act. Dr. Smith also found swelling of the
    brain. The new expert evidence shows that there was no evidence of swelling of
    the brain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the cause of death, the experts could find no positive evidence to
    support a finding of suffocation or smothering by a third party.  At the time
    of his death, the child was not sleeping in a regular crib, but rather in a
    playpen that contained blankets and quilts.  The autopsy findings and the
    findings at the scene suggest that death probably occurred by an accidental
    asphyxial means in an unsafe sleeping environment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant applies to have the material gathered as part of the
    coroner’s investigation and the Goudge Inquiry admitted as fresh evidence.  The
    Crown fairly concedes that this material meets the test for fresh evidence. 
    The Crown also agrees that the affidavit of the appellant and her trial lawyer
    should be admitted.  These affidavits explain how it was that the appellant
    agreed to the procedure that led to her conviction for infanticide.  The
    police, the Crown and the defence all relied upon Dr. Smith’s expert opinion
    and, given his stature at the time, the appellant and her counsel did not
    believe that they could successfully contest his opinion.  As Crown counsel
    says in his factum, the fresh expert opinion now conclusively refutes critical
    aspects of Dr. Smith’s opinion.  His opinion was a central underpinning of the
    Crown’s case at trial and without that evidence there was no reasonable
    prospect of conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the cogency and reliability of the fresh expert opinion evidence,
    the Crown concedes that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed
    and an acquittal entered.  We agree.  The fresh evidence is compelling and
    while it can never be conclusively established how the appellant’s child died,
    it is likely that he died accidentally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase what this court said in R<i>. v. Mullins-Johnson</i> (2007),
    87 O.R. (3d) 125, the death of a child is always tragic. In this case, the
    tragedy of four-month-old Joshua's death is compounded by the fact her mother
    was wrongfully convicted of infanticide, served a one-year jail sentence and
    lost the custody of her other child. It is now clear that the evidence cannot
    support a finding that the appellant killed her child.  Indeed, Mr. Shandler
    concedes that had the fresh evidence been available back in 1996, the Crown
    would never have proceeded with any prosecution of the appellant. The fresh
    evidence shows that the appellant's conviction was wrong and that she was the
    subject of a miscarriage of justice. It is profoundly regrettable that, as a
    result of what has been shown to be flawed pathological evidence, the appellant
    was wrongly convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the fresh evidence is admitted, the appeal is allowed, the
    conviction for infanticide is set aside and an acquittal entered.</p>
