  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three grounds of appeal from this wrongful
    dismissal decision awarding 24 months severance plus <i>Wallace</i> damages of
    two months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first ground is that the trial judge erred in treating the
    respondent as a 23-year employee even though there was a two-year gap in her
    employment after 6 years when she left to have her second child. We would not
    give effect to this ground of appeal. The respondent was invited back after two
    years even though she was not on official maternity leave. She left the employment
    for family reasons and not for another job. The gap is only two years and the
    respondent, having been invited back, was reintegrated into the employer’s
    employment as if she had never left.  For example, she was given 2 weeks
    vacation within the first year without first working for 12 months as a new
    employee would have to.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue is whether the two months award for <i>Wallace</i> damages ($8,826.56) can survive the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Honda
    Canada Inc. v. Keays</i>, 2008 SCC 39, which was released following argument
    but before the reasons in this case were released by the trial judge. In our
    view, the appeal must be allowed on this ground. Although the appellant’s
    conduct in wrongfully alleging misconduct against the respondent was improper, any
    claim for punitive damages based on that conduct was abandoned before the trial.
    While the respondent’s misconduct in this respect could have led to a proper award
    of mental distress damages as defined in <i>Keays</i>, the mental distress that
    the respondent suffered upon her termination and the manner of that termination
    was not of the nature and scope to qualify for compensatory damages in
    accordance with that decision, as the respondent did not seek any medical attention,
    professional assistance or undergo any therapy for her mental distress. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third ground of appeal is based on the double counting of the <i>Employment
    Standards Act</i> severance payment of $20,240.  By agreement of counsel, that
    amount will be removed from the total damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is allowed in part, and the damages calculation
    (before the imposition of the $140,000 cap) will be reduced by $8,826.56 plus
    $20,240 with costs to the respondent of $8,000 inclusive of disbursements and
    G.S.T.</p>
