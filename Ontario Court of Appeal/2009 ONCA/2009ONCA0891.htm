  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At nine o’clock one October morning in 2003, the appellant, Guy Young,
    disguised in a UPS uniform and carrying a UPS box, went into a jewellery store
    in the Sherway Mall with an accomplice.  Once inside the store, Mr. Young
    produced a loaded shot gun.  He ordered the store owner and an employee to lie
    on the ground and open the store safe.  Although terrified, the owner managed
    to push the alarm button.  When Mr. Young and his accomplice realized what had
    happened, they fled.  However, before leaving the mall, Mr. Young turned back
    and shot the store owner, shattering his shin bone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Young was tried before Molloy J. and a jury on a 9-count indictment,
    which included robbery, use of a firearm and attempted murder.  The Crown’s
    case was compelling: Mr. Young’s fingerprint was found on the UPS box; the
    store owner identified Mr. Young from a photo array; and Mr. Young made a
    series of inculpatory statements to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury found Mr. Young guilty on all counts, except for reducing the
    attempt murder charge to a conviction for aggravated assault.  Molloy J.
    sentenced him to a global sentence of 11 years in prison, after giving four
    years credit for pre-trial custody.  She also ordered that Mr. Young not be
    eligible for parole until he has served at least one half of his sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Young appeals both his conviction and his sentence.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call on the Crown on either the conviction or the sentence
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his conviction appeal, Mr. Young, in his factum, submitted that the
    trial judge erred in admitting his statements to the police, principally
    because they were not videotaped.  In oral argument, Mr. Young abandoned his
    challenge to the admissibility of his statements.  Instead he argued that the
    trial judge did not instruct the jury strongly enough on why the police’s
    failure to videotape the statements might affect their reliability and weight.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Young also argued that the trial judge erred in admitting the
    identification evidence because the photo array was not conducted in accordance
    with the recommendations of Justice Cory in the Sophonow Report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We saw no merit in these arguments.  Mr. Young did not testify on the <i>voir
    dire</i> into the admissibility of the statements.  Molloy J. gave a thorough
    and well-reasoned ruling on why the statements were admissible.  She also
    adequately instructed the jurors on the reliability and weight they might give
    to the statements because they were not videotaped.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of her ruling on the admissibility of the statements,
    Molloy J. adverted to what appears to an ongoing misperception among some
    police officers on the right to videotape (or tape record) the taking of a
    statement from an accused.  At paras. 25 to 26 of her ruling she wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree that the taking of a formal statement from
    a suspect is different from filming the routine matters that occur at arrival
    and booking.  However, there is nothing about the taking of a formal statement
    that precludes it being tape recorded right from the start.  It is appropriate
    to explain to a suspect that the interview is being videotaped and why, and
    there is nothing wrong with discontinuing the videotaping if the suspect does
    not wish to be recorded.  However, there is absolutely no legal requirement to
    start the interview without taping and to only turn on the recording device
    upon obtaining consent.  Quite to the contrary, the norm should be that a
    suspect is spoken to from the outset with the videotape in operation: <i>R. v.
    Backhouse</i> at para. 118.  It should only be discontinued if the suspect
    objects.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not clear to me where these officers got the
    idea that it was unlawful to start the recording before getting permission. 
    However, this is not the first time that I have heard police officers speak of
    it.  It appears to be a commonly held view.  Crown counsel in this case was
    unaware why police officers had this understanding, but agreed that there was
    no legal basis for it.  I felt it important to comment on this formally in the
    hope that steps would be taken within the police force to educate officers on
    the importance of recording interviews from the outset.  Otherwise, the
    important principles underlying cases such as <i>Moore-McFarlane</i> will be
    seriously undermined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We affirm these comments.  They hearken back to the words of Rosenberg J.A.
    in <i>R. v. Backhouse</i> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 118:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That said, I should not be taken as holding that it
    will always be an answer to the failure to videotape the statement that the
    suspect has refused to participate.  It could become all too easy for the
    authorities to attempt to avoid the impact of this court’s decision in <i>Moore-McFarlane</i> by attributing to the suspect a refusal to have his statements videotaped.  It
    would still be open to the police to tape record the statement, or at the very
    least electronically record the suspect’s wishes, to avoid any later dispute. 
    Depending on the context, the trial judge might well view with concern a bare
    assertion by police officers that the suspect refused to be videotaped or even
    tape-recorded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the police are entitled to begin to videotape or tape record an
    accused’s statement.  If the accused then objects or refuses to be videotaped,
    at least there will be a record of the accused’s refusal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The identification evidence was admissible although the photo array did
    not meet the Sophonow requirements.  Its deficiencies were a matter of weight
    for the jury, and Molloy J. outlined in detail all the ways the photo
    identification in this case fell short of Justice Cory’s recommendations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molloy J. gave lengthy reasons for the sentence she imposed.  We see no
    error in her reasons.  The sentence of 11 years after credit for pre-trial
    custody and a parole ineligibility order are entirely fit, given the nature of
    the offence, Mr. Young’s gratuitous and callous shooting of the store owner,
    and his lengthy criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
