style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment, in addition to
    six months pre-sentence custody, for breaching the alcohol abstention condition
    of his long-term supervision order.  The appellant submits that</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)    the sentence is demonstrably
      unfit; </p>
    <p>(2)    the sentencing judge
      misapprehended the evidence relating to breaches that led to suspension of the
      appellant’s release; </p>
    <p>(3)    the appellant should have

  </blockquote>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a 37-year-old Inuit with a tragic background.  He has a
    very long and very serious criminal record that includes three convictions for
    violent assaults, one for sexual assault, and one for sexual assault causing
    bodily harm, the predicate offence to his designation as a long-term offender. 
    This latter offence was a vicious sexual assault on a vulnerable 50-year-old
    homeless woman committed shortly after the appellant’s release from a prison
    sentence following conviction for another sexual assault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Intoxication played a major role in the appellant’s violent offences. 
    The evidence led on the long-term offender proceeding indicated that the
    appellant suffers from anti-social personality disorder and alcohol abuse
    disorder and that alcohol consumption is directly linked to the violent
    offences he has committed and is a major risk factor for re-offending.  A
    forensic psychiatrist from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Heath stated in
    his report that “[a]ny breaches in his alcohol abstention conditions would have
    to be seriously and immediately dealt with, as this, I believe, is the major
    risk factor for serious violent or sexual re-[offence] with this individual.” 
    The trial judge in the long-term offender proceeding found a consistent pattern
    of “Mr. Ipeelee administering gratuitous violence against vulnerable, helpless
    people while is in a state of intoxication.”  He determined that the risk of
    re-offending was substantial: “Indeed, if he has access to alcohol, it is as
    certain as night follows day.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After serving the full six-year custodial sentence imposed for the
    predicate offence in the Kingston Penitentiary, the appellant was released to a
    community correctional centre in Kingston.  His release was suspended a number
    of times for short periods but then reinstated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offence in question here was committed 17 months after the date of
    his initial release.  The appellant was found in possession of alcohol and in a
    severely intoxicated state riding a bicycle the wrong way on a one-way portion
    of a major downtown street.  The appellant pleaded guilty to this offence and had
    served six months pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF
    THE SENTENCING JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]his was a serious and not
    at all trivial breach of a very fundamental condition of the offender's long-term
    supervision order.  It is a very central and essential condition, because
    alcohol abuse was involved, not only in the predicate offence, but also in most
    of the offenses on the offender's criminal record.  On his history, Mr. Ipeelee
    becomes violent when he abuses alcohol, and he was assessed as posing a
    significant risk of re-offending sexually.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge held that in the case of a breach of a long-term
    offender condition, for which Parliament has set a maximum sentence of ten
    years, protection of the public is the paramount concern and rehabilitation has
    only a small role.  This distinguishes the offence from breach of a probation
    order and warrants the imposition of a more severe penalty. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>(1)       Is the sentence demonstrably unfit?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that an effective sentence of three years for this
    offence was demonstrably unfit.  This was not simply a case of public
    intoxication or cycling under the influence of alcohol.  I agree with the
    sentencing judge that as this case involves the breach of a vital condition of
    a long-term supervision order, and that given the appellant’s demonstrated
    propensity to commit violent offences under the influence of alcohol, the
    predominant concern is for public protection.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>(2)       Did the sentencing judge misapprehend the
    evidence relating to breaches that led to suspension of the appellant’s
    release?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge noted in his reasons that the appellant’s release
    on long-term supervision had been suspended four times and that these suspensions
    were mostly alcohol-related.  This was not accurate, although there were
    allegations of refused urinalysis and diluted urine samples.  However, I agree
    with the respondent’s submission that any misapprehension as to the reason for
    the prior suspensions did not affect the sentence imposed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>(3)       Did the sentencing judge err by refusing
    enhanced credit?</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge refused to give the appellant enhanced credit for
    the six months he spent in pre-sentence custody.  In the circumstance of this
    case, I see no error.  As the sentencing judge noted, the time under the
    long-term supervision order continues to run while the offender is in
    pre-sentence custody for breach of a condition of the order.  Moreover, the
    lack of credit for time served towards early release, a factor usually cited as
    a reason for enhanced credit, is less relevant here as the appellant is
    unlikely to be granted early release. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>(4)       Did the sentencing judge fail to give
    adequate consideration to the appellant’s aboriginal status?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge adverted to the appellant’s entitlement in
    sentencing to the consideration of his aboriginal status under <i>R. v. Gladue</i>,
    [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 and s.&nbsp;718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He
    noted, however, that the appellant had already received consideration for his
    aboriginal status on the sentence imposed for the predicate offence leading to
    the long-term supervision order and that at this point, when protection of the
    public is the dominant concern, his aboriginal status is of diminished importance.
    The sentencing judge held that imposing a sentence at the lower end of the
    three to five year range proposed by the Crown, with adequate credit for
    pre-sentence custody, would adequately reflect the appellant’s aboriginal
    status and the mitigating effect of his guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the role that the appellant’s disadvantaged background has
    played in his criminal behaviour is the most troubling aspect of this appeal.  While
    there may well be breaches of long-term offender orders that call for sentences
    of more than three years, I am not persuaded that this particular offence falls
    into that category.  Despite the sentencing judge’s comment, I do not think
    that, in the end, the appellant’s aboriginal status led to any reduction from
    the sentence that he would otherwise have been received. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not at all clear to me, however, that in the circumstances of this
    case, consideration of his aboriginal status should lead to a reduction in his
    sentence for breach of the long-term offender condition.  The appellant’s
    commission of violent offences and the risk he poses for re-offending when
    under the influence of alcohol make the principles of denunciation, deterrence
    and protection of the public paramount.  This is one of those cases where “the
    appropriate sentence will…not differ as between aboriginal and non-aboriginal
    offenders”: <i>R. v. Carri</i><i><span style='line-height:200%'>è</span>re</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 569 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 17.  As the appellant has been
    declared a long-term offender, “consideration of restorative justice and other
    features of aboriginal sentencing…play little or no role”: <i>R. v. H.P.W. </i>(2003),
    327 A.R. 170 (Alta. C.A.) at para. 50.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I feel compelled to add, however, that the appellant’s aboriginal
    background and the disadvantage he has suffered clearly provide insight into
    his sorry involvement with the criminal justice system.  He grew up in Nunavat.
     His alcoholic mother froze to death when he was a child.  He was raised by his
    grandparents, one of whom has died.  His involvement with alcohol and crime
    started at an early age.  He complains that an older person sexually abused him
    when he was nine. He lost many close relatives while serving his penitentiary
    term and at this point, he appears to lack links with his own community.  He
    was not released in his home community in Iqualuit because the Inuit-oriented
    facility there refused to accept him on the ground that he posed an undue risk
    of re-offending.  The community correctional facility in Kingston has
    relatively little to offer by way of aboriginal services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is to be commended for the progress he has made with
    traditional soapstone carving.  However, his psychiatric disorder and addiction
    clearly pose serious obstacles to his rehabilitation.  It is regrettable that
    he has not been afforded more access to services tailored to his background and
    heritage, although I recognize that his condition and the attitude of his own
    community present the correctional authorities with many challenges with
    respect to his management and treatment.  Still, I would feel remiss if I did
    not include in these reasons a plea that the correctional authorities make
    every effort to provide the appellant with appropriate aboriginal-oriented
    assistance.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal sentence but dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
