  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found guilty of two counts of sexual
    assault committed when he was thirteen years old.  The complainant on the first count was a nine-year-old
    girl who described four incidents.  The
    most important incident for this appeal involved a “shaker <span class=GramE>toy</span>”
    or mechanical vibrator.  The complainant
    on the second count was a young boy in grade five who gave evidence of two
    separate incidents.  The families of all
    three young people knew each other.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant gave evidence and denied all of the
    allegations.  In particular, he gave a
    long and detailed version of the “shaker toy” incident consistent with his own
    innocence and blaming the complainant for using the device on herself.  His response to the incidents described by
    the second complainant was essentially a bald denial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals the findings of guilt.  Three of the arguments he raises can easily
    be dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First he argues that in accepting the complainant’s
    evidence about the “shaker toy” the trial judge improperly took judicial notice
    of the lack of sexual knowledge of nine-year-old girls.  I do not agree.  The trial judge simply found that this
    evidence was beyond the girl’s ability to fabricate.  The trial judge was speaking of this
    complainant, not all nine-year-old girls.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant says the trial judge failed to
    give proper consideration to the possibility of collusion between the two
    complainants.  Again, I disagree.  The trial judge considered the evidence of
    the very limited contact between the two complainants about what happened and
    found as a fact that there was no collusion.  This finding is amply supported by the evidence and is one that was open
    to the trial judge to make.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant argues that the trial judge failed
    to apply sufficient scrutiny to the evidence of the complainants, particularly
    the young girl.  However, the reasons for
    judgment provide a complete answer to this.  The trial judge paid explicit and detailed attention to the weaknesses
    in her evidence, particularly inconsistencies about dates and the sequencing of
    events, and her statement at the end of her evidence that she did not know if
    all the things she described actually happened.  The trial judge carefully explained why, given her age, her bipolar
    disorder, her difficulty communicating, and her difficulty concentrating at the
    end of her testimony, the trial judge nonetheless accepted her detailed and compelling
    description of the acts alleged.  This
    was more than adequate scrutiny of her testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last ground of appeal is more troubling.  Because the appellant gave evidence, the
    trial judge was obliged to follow the direction provided in <i>R. v. W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i>, [1991]
    1 S.C.R. 742.  The trial judge correctly
    recited the three steps that this case requires be taken in assessing the
    evidence before finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, in applying those steps to the
    evidence here, the trial judge framed the second step using language different
    from that of <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i>.  Having first rejected the appellant’s
    evidence, the trial judge moved to the second step of the analysis, but instead
    of determining whether, nonetheless, the appellant’s evidence left her in
    reasonable doubt (as <i>W.(D.)</i> requires),
    the trial judge concluded that the appellant’s evidence “<i>could</i> not <i>reasonably </i>be
    true” (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has repeatedly said that a trial judge errs
    in using the “could reasonably be true” test at the second step in the <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> analysis.  That is equally true of its
    equivalents “might reasonably be true” and “can reasonably be true”: see <i>R. v. G.H. </i>(2002), 165 O.A.C. 56 (C.A.); <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rattray</span></i> (2007), 222 O.A.C. 28 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are good reasons why this test must not be
    used.  It is different from the proper approach
    to step two set out in <i>W. (D.)</i> (<span
class=GramE>namely</span>, whether, even if the accused’s evidence is
    disbelieved, the trial judge is left in reasonable doubt by it) in several
    respects.  First, it arguably risks
    reversing the burden of proof and undermining the presumption of innocence: see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rattray</span></i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 13.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it asks more of the accused’s evidence than
    step two requires.  It invites an
    objective assessment of the accused’s evidence against the standard of what
    could reasonably be true, rather than simply assessing that evidence to see if
    it leaves the trier with a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, as the jurisprudence in this court
    demonstrates, there are cases in which this error may not result in
    reversal.  In some, the trial judge has used
    inappropriate phraseology but otherwise made clear that he or she understands
    the proper approach to the burden of proof and proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  In such a case, while the
    phrasing is wrong, <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> is followed in substance: see for example <i>R.
    v. S.K.</i>, 2008 ONCA 285.  In others,
    the accused’s evidence has been completely rejected and the Crown’s case is
    overwhelming.  In essence, this is the
    application of the <i>proviso</i> in s.
    686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code:</i> see for example <i>R.
    v. G.H.</i> and <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rattray</span>.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge used the erroneous
    phrasing exclusively and repeatedly at step two of <i>W. (D.)</i>.  Moreover, there is
    nothing in the balance of the reasons to suggest that, despite this, the proper
    step two <span class=GramE>evaluation</span> is being followed in
    substance.  However, at least with
    respect to the first complainant, the trial judge categorically rejected the
    appellant’s evidence as entirely unreasonable and illogical.  There was more than ample basis for her to do
    so.  Having so concluded, it is
    inconceivable that the appellant’s evidence could have left her with a
    reasonable doubt.  The Crown’s case was
    overwhelming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the second complainant, the trial judge
    rejected the accused’s evidence which was little more than a bald denial.  In this circumstance, I do not think there is
    any chance that a mere bald denial, once rejected, could have left the trial
    judge with a reasonable doubt.  Coupled
    with the overwhelming case presented by the Crown, I cannot find that the trial
    judge’s error requires a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
