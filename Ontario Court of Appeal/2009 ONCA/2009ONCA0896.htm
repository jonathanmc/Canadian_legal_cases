  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Song pleaded guilty to a charge of production of
    marijuana.  He received a twelve-month
    conditional sentence<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> from which the Crown seeks to appeal, arguing that a period of incarceration
    was required in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those circumstances involved <span class=GramE>a large</span>-scale
    marijuana grow operation in a residential area.  Over 1,400 marijuana plants were seized.  The operation also involved a hydro bypass and the theft of electricity for
    which Mr. Song agreed to pay the sum of $14,866.66 to Hydro One Brampton as
    restitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the Crown, Mr. Wilson acknowledges that to
    succeed he must show both that the trial judge made an error, or errors, in
    principle and that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Errors in Principle</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge made at least three errors in
    principle, in our view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he ignored or failed to give effect to the
    jurisprudence emanating from this Court in cases such as <i>R. v. Jacobson</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 270, at para. 31, and <i>R. v. Nguyen</i> (2007), 227 C.C.C. (3d)
    262, at para. 46, to the effect that conditional sentences will be rare – even
    for first offenders – in cases involving large residential marijuana grow
    operations.  In this regard, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Well, the law as I understand it in this area is
    that the practice … perhaps rather than some of the utterances that have been
    made in different cases in the Court of Appeal is one largely of deference to
    the trial judge.  I <span class=GramE>have
    been</span> unable to find myself, nor have I been referred to a case where the
    Ontario Court of Appeal has substituted a term of real incarceration when a
    conditional sentence has been imposed in a case such as this.  And I have been doing these cases for a long
    time …It is a matter of local practice and it is a matter of deference by the
    appeal court, or certainly by our Court of Appeal, which is the one that
    matters to us, as to what happens to someone in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, as we shall explain, however, the sentencing
    judge turned the principle of deference on its head.  He treated it not as <span class=GramE>a
    recognition</span> of his front line connection to the community and of his
    proximity to the dynamics of the proceeding, but rather as leave to impose with
    impunity a sentence based on his personal views of national drug policy, about
    which more will be said shortly.  This
    was plainly wrong and constituted an unreasonable exercise of discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the sentencing judge refused to apply both
    the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and binding jurisprudence mandating that general and specific deterrence be
    taken into account in arriving at an appropriate sentence in cases of this
    nature:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 718(b).  See also <i>R. v. Chen</i> (2007),
    2007 ONCA 230, at para. 2; <i>Nguyen </i>at
    para. 47; <i>R. v. Dawson</i> (2004), 189
    O.A.C. 147 (C.A.); <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Koenders</span></i> (2007), 221 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (B.C.C.A.), at
    paras. 20-21.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet the sentencing judge discounted general deterrence,
    to the point of suggesting it would be “insane” to consider it.  For example, in the course of an exchange
    with Crown counsel and in his reasons he made the following comments:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>During Submissions</u>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown<span class=GramE>:           …</span> I think there will be a general deterrence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court:     What’s
    your basis for saying that?  <span
class=GramE>Because nobody has been deterred.</span>  People have been going to jail for <span
class=GramE>drug offences for – for a couple of generations now and the drug –
    the drug plague is worse than it ever was</span>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown:           Well,
    there’s – yes.  There’s no <span
class=GramE>statistical ..</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court:     If – if something doesn’t work, do I try doing it again and again to see if it
    does work?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown:           I would …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court:     I
    think there’s …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown:           There’s no way of knowing …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court:     Isn’t
    that the definition of insanity?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Reasons</u>:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And as I commented in submissions from counsel <span
class=GramE>…  I</span> do not understand
    the idea of deterrence in this area.  I
    do not know that there are, for example, fewer grow operations in Hamilton than
    there are in Brampton, even though you are likely to go to jail for real in
    Hamilton and less likely to do so here.  I do know that in the United States, which makes us look like we are all
    living in <span class=SpellE>Northwestern</span> Europe by comparison, a
    country which has huge numbers of people serving life without parole for
    growing marijuana or trafficking in moderate amounts of it, that drugs are as
    available there, or perhaps more available than they are in jurisdictions where
    the laws are more lenient.  I am given to
    understand the chances of <span class=GramE>a Dutch</span> teenager smoking
    marijuana are substantially lower than they are of an American teenager smoking
    marijuana.  And the Dutch teenager can
    walk down to the corner and get it at a coffee shop.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no evidence to support any of these
    observations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judges are entitled to hold personal and political
    opinions as much as anyone else.  But
    they are not free to permit those views to colour or frame their trial and
    sentencing decisions.  They are bound to
    apply the law as it stands.  And this is
    the final error we wish to underline. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge’s reasons make it clear – albeit
    in breezy and colourful fashion – that he personally has little use for a
    sentencing regime that seeks to cope with marijuana offences by relying upon
    principles of deterrence and by the imposition of “real” jail sentences.  This is reflected in the passage above, for
    example, and reinforced in the following excerpts:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The aggravating factors in a case like this are
    really the things that are incidental to the criminalization of the activity.  Sources as conservative as The Economist
    Magazine and the Fraser Institute think-tank in this country, which are very,
    very conservative organizations maintain that drug prohibition is an absolute
    failure and that we would do less damage to ourselves if the whole undertaking
    were dismantled.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is particularly appropriate in the case of
    marijuana, according to their arguments, because really what we’re doing by
    prohibiting the production and consumption of marijuana is giving the Hell’s
    Angels several billion dollars worth of income every year which is then turned
    into investments in what would otherwise be legitimate businesses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So I quite frankly, simply, do not buy into the
    idea that by treating individuals like this harshly notwithstanding their lack
    of a record and the nature of the substance that they were producing that I am
    going to improve things at all.  Likewise, the issue with home invasions, if this were not illegal then
    there would not be the home invasions.  So, it is not an intrinsic aspect of growing marijuana that people are
    going to bust in on you with guns and try and take it away from you, it is
    rather a function of the fact that it is illegal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, later in his reasons, he continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The really important factors in this case are that
    this is the least harmful drug covered by the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>.  The Supreme Court of Canada had to basically
    ignore the harm principle, the John Stewart Mill fundamental principle of
    criminal law in order to uphold these laws and then promptly readopted it again
    in a subsequent case involving Montreal sex clubs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether these views have merit is a debate for another
    forum – one in which judges do not participate.  Personal diatribes of the nature engaged in by the sentencing judge here
    are unhelpful, however, and demonstrate to us a lack of objectivity that
    undermines the deference generally afforded to judges.  The principle of deference is not a license
    for the sentencing judge to defy settled jurisprudence, ignore the principles
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, or use his or
    her dais as a political podium.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Fitness of the Sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These errors in principle re-open the fitness of the
    sentence for our consideration at large.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the authorities referred to above, and applying
    conventional principles of sentencing, we find it very difficult to conclude
    that this is one of those rare cases where a conditional sentence is
    appropriate.  Mr. Song was engaged in a
    large-scale commercial marijuana grow operation involving more than 1,400
    plants worth a considerable amount of money, on any estimation, in the
    market.  Even the trial judge
    acknowledged that the grow operation “might have yielded a fair amount of money
    eventually.”   The enterprise was carried
    on in a residential area and featured the theft of a considerable amount of
    electricity through a hydro bypass.  While Mr. Song did plead guilty and had no prior criminal record, there
    was little else of a mitigating nature, and much of an aggravating nature, in
    the circumstances.  Unlike in other
    cases, for example, there were no issues of ill-health, dire financial need or
    addiction to explain the operation.  It
    was a purely commercial venture.  Mr.
    Song was the person setting up and running the operation and held a significant
    degree of responsibility for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Nguyen </i>was a
    somewhat similar case on the facts.  There, this Court upheld a sentence of 15 months incarceration and a
    hydro restitution order of $10,000.  In
    doing so, LaForme J.A. wrote, at paras. 47-48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This was a large scale marijuana grow
    operation.  The warrant yielded 1,121
    plants and 18 pounds of harvested marijuana.  As well $10,000 of electricity was stolen during the operation.  The trial judge determined that these
    circumstances required the need for denunciation and general deterrence that
    could not be achieved through a conditional sentence.  She was entitled to do so.  <i>This is
    not one of the rare cases.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge, in my view, was also entitled to
    decline to impose a conditional sentence in light of the evidence of the
    increasing prevalence of this form of offence in the local community and the
    danger caused by the hydro by-pass: see <i>R.
    v. Nguyen, <span class=SpellE>Khuong</span> Van</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 2480 (QL)
    (C.J.); varied on other grounds, [2002] O.J. No. 5490 (QL) (C.A.).  It is important to note that trial courts
    have observed that there is <span class=GramE><i>an increase in large-scale marijuana grow</i></span><i> operations with accompanying violence and
    threats of violence that courts must respond to</i>.  For example, see <i>R. v. Nguyen, <span class=SpellE>Manh</span> Hung</i>, [2006] O.J. No.
    1607 (QL), 69 W.C.B. (2d) 396 (C.J.). [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with these observations and find them
    applicable to this case.  Not only did
    the trial judge fail to respect these and other jurisprudential guidelines, he
    acted on the very opposite principles.  This is not one of those rare marijuana grow operation cases where a
    conditional sentence would have been appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dilemma we face, however, is the practical reality
    that Mr. Song has completely served the sentence imposed on him.  This Court is reluctant to send people to, or
    back to, prison in such circumstances.  Had we been dealing with this matter <i>de
    novo</i> at trial, a period of incarceration would clearly have been
    warranted.  Indeed, had the matter come
    to us in a timely fashion before the conditional sentence had been served, we
    would have imposed a custodial term.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end – without taking away from any of our
    observations above – we are not persuaded that it would serve the interests of
    justice to send Mr. Song to prison at this point.  Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, the appeal as to sentence must be dismissed.</p>
