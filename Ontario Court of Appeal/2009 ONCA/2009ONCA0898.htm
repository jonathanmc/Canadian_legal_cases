  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 28, 1999, the appellant, then a healthy
    17-year-old boy, went swimming at Pinery Provincial Park (the “Pinery”) at Lake
    Huron.  Standing in three feet of water,
    he dove in.  His head hit either an
    underwater sand bar or the flat bottom of the lake.  Tragically, he broke his neck and was
    rendered a tetraplegic.  He sued the
    respondents, who are the owners and operators of the park.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Damages were agreed to, and a trial proceeded on
    liability alone.  The trial judge
    dismissed the action.  He concluded
    first, that the appellant’s injuries were caused by his own negligence; second,
    that the appellant failed to prove that he hit his head on a sandbar rather
    than the bottom of the lake; and third, that in any event the sandbars did not
    constitute a hazard to swimmers for which the respondents could be held liable
    under the <i>Occupiers’ Liability Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990 c. O.2. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I find that the trial
    judge erred in each of these three conclusions and none can stand.  Regrettably, there must be a new trial on
    liability.  </p>
  <h4>A.  <span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant began swimming at a very young age.  He was a strong swimmer, but had never been
    swimming in water where there were sandbars.  Nor had he ever been to the Pinery before.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was a great deal of evidence about the sandbars
    at the Pinery.  There was no dispute that
    they were numerous and were present from shallow to deep water.  They moved constantly from season to season.  On a wavy day (and August 28, 1999 was such a
    day), they are not visible from shore, and once in the water, a person cannot
    see the sandbars at all.  Beyond this, there
    was contested expert evidence on the maximum height of the sandbars, their shape
    and slope, and where they might have been located on August 28, 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only direct evidence about the way the appellant’s
    injuries occurred came from the appellant himself.  He testified that he was standing in three
    feet of water, did a shallow dive and struck his head on the sand almost
    immediately.  There is no doubt that the
    impact broke his neck.  He was face down
    in the water, but before he lost consciousness was able to see that he was
    floating over a large mound of sand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, there was a woman nearby who helped rescue
    him.  While she did not see the dive that
    led to the appellant’s injuries, she had observed the appellant in the few
    minutes that preceded it.  She described
    him as diving into the waves in a glide or belly flop.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were no signs at the Pinery warning swimmers of
    the danger posed by underwater sandbars.  However, a number of Pinery staff testified that they were unaware of
    any injuries having been caused by these sandbars in the past.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.  THE DECISION AT
    TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of factual causation was of fundamental
    importance in this trial.  What caused
    the appellant’s injuries on August 28, 1999?  As the trial judge repeatedly recognized throughout the trial, there
    were only two possibilities: the appellant hit his head either on a sandbar or
    on the bottom of the lake.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, rather than expressly addressing and resolving
    this question first, the trial judge began his analysis with the question of
    the appellant’s own negligence.  He found
    that the appellant was negligent, first, for not being sufficiently aware of
    the variations in the depth of the water caused by the presence of sandbars;
    and second, for choosing to dive from a standing position in water that was too
    shallow and when he could not see the bottom of the lake.  The trial judge then concluded that the cause
    of the appellant’s injuries was the appellant’s own negligence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to an express consideration
    of the factual causation issue and concluded that the appellant had not proven
    that he hit his head on a sandbar rather than the bottom of the lake.  The trial judge set out his reasoning as
    follows at para. 32-33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Taking
    into consideration that the plaintiff, prior to the accident said that he had
    not seen a sand bar or the bottom of the lake and, considering that whatever
    the plaintiff saw was with his eyes open under water when under water he
    normally closes his eyes, and considering that whatever he thinks he saw could
    have been only for a brief period of time since he lost consciousness, there is
    raised considerable doubt whether the plaintiff’s head hit a sand bar rather
    than the bottom of the lake.&nbsp; Furthermore, he had his hands out to break
    the water for his dive and although he says his head hit something immediately
    he does not remember his hands hitting a sand bar.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Considering
    all of the evidence as to what the plaintiff’s head hit, I find that the
    plaintiff has failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that he hit his
    head on a sand bar rather than the bottom of the lake.&nbsp; The plaintiff’s
    injuries are consistent with his head hitting a sand bar or the bottom of the
    lake.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the trial judge considered the question of the
    respondents’ liability under the <i>Occupiers’
    Liability Act</i>.  He concluded at
    paras. 37-39: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Tens of
    thousands of people have enjoyed swimming off the beaches of Pinery Park over
    the forty years prior to the plaintiff’s accident.&nbsp; Tens of thousands of
    people have been swimming in several other Ontario Parks where there are sand
    bars.&nbsp; There is no evidence that anyone, prior to the plaintiff’s
    accident, was injured as a result of the presence of sand bars in the
    water.&nbsp; In my view the fact of no previous or subsequent injuries speaks
    loudly and clearly that sand bars are not a hazard to swimmers.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>I find
    that it was not foreseeable that after forty years of no injuries caused by
    sand bars at Pinery Park, an experienced swimmer would attempt a dive from a
    standing position in shallow water when he could not see the bottom of the lake
    and did not determine whether he could make a safe dive.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>[I] find
    that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant is liable under <i>The
    Occupiers’ Liability Act.</i></span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.  ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges each of these conclusions.  I will address each in turn.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            <i>i) The appellant’s negligence</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the appellant’s injuries
    were caused by his own negligence.  He
    was found negligent in two respects.  First, the trial judge found that the appellant was insufficiently aware
    of the presence of sandbars.  This insufficient
    awareness, however, could have caused the appellant’s injuries only if the
    appellant struck his head on a sandbar.  Otherwise, his insufficient awareness of the presence of sandbars could not
    have contributed to the appellant’s injuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this basis for finding that the appellant’s
    negligence caused his own injuries is necessarily based on a finding by the
    trial judge of factual causation that is fundamentally inconsistent with his
    later express finding on the same issue, which was that the appellant did not
    prove that he hit his head on a sandbar rather than the bottom of the lake.  The trial judge must have found that the
    appellant hit a sandbar to conclude that his insufficient awareness of sandbars
    caused his injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same criticism applies, although perhaps not so
    starkly, to the second way in which the trial judge found the appellant
    negligent; namely, that he chose to dive from a standing position in water that
    was too shallow when he could not see the bottom of the lake.  The context for this finding is the
    appellant’s evidence (which the respondent did not challenge) that his dive was
    a shallow one and the evidence from the appellant’s expert (which the trial
    judge did not reject) that a shallow dive could be safely done in three feet of
    water if the bottom was flat.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As with the first basis for finding the appellant
    negligent, this finding can be made only if the trial judge concluded that the
    appellant hit a sandbar.  Diving into
    water that was too shallow could have caused the appellant’s injuries only if
    he hit a sandbar.  Standing in three feet
    of water, a shallow dive would not have caused the appellant to hit the flat
    bottom of the lake.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize, I conclude that the trial judge, in
    finding the appellant negligent, must have implicitly concluded that the
    appellant struck his head on a sandbar.  However, in dismissing the action, the trial judge also found that he
    could not decide whether the appellant hit his head on a sandbar rather than
    the bottom of the lake.  It was not open
    to the trial judge to make both findings.  To make such inconsistent findings on the central issue of factual
    causation is an error of law requiring appellate intervention: see <i>R. v. D.R.</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 291 at para.
    50.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>ii) Factual causation </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After he dealt with the appellant’s own negligence, the
    trial judge expressly addressed the question of factual causation and found
    that the appellant had failed to prove that he hit his head on a sandbar rather
    than the bottom of the lake.  Apart from the
    fundamental inconsistency between this and the implicit finding on the same
    issue that necessarily underpins the trial judge’s conclusion of the
    appellant’s own negligence, it constitutes a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, none of the considerations that, in the trial
    judge’s view, “raised considerable doubt” whether the appellant’s head hit a
    sandbar rather than the bottom of the lake, in fact lead to that
    conclusion.  They neither make it less
    likely that he hit a sandbar nor more likely that he hit the bottom of the
    lake.  The trial judge recites these
    considerations in para. 32 of his reasons, reproduced above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the appellant said he did not see either
    a sandbar or the bottom of the lake prior to the accident says nothing about which
    one he hit, particularly since the sandbars were not visible from the
    water.  Nor is the trial judge’s doubt
    supported by what the appellant saw underwater after impact.  If anything, that tends to show that he hit a
    sandbar.  The same is true of the fact
    that the appellant could have seen the pile of sand only for a brief period of
    time before losing consciousness.  Finally, the trial judge considered the appellant’s evidence that he
    does not remember his hands hitting a sandbar on his dive.  But what the appellant does not remember is
    of no help in determining whether he hit a sandbar or the bottom.  The trial judge used these neutral considerations
    to draw an unwarranted conclusion that the evidence cannot sustain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More significantly, the trial judge appears to have
    disregarded important relevant evidence in concluding that the appellant had
    not proven that he hit a sandbar.  In
    particular, the appellant’s evidence was that he did a shallow dive and that
    his head hit the sand almost immediately.  Even the defence expert acknowledged that, in that event, it is more
    likely than not that the appellant hit a sandbar.  Apart from reciting the appellant’s evidence,
    the trial judge made reference to it only in apparent juxtaposition to the
    evidence of the nearby woman who described the appellant’s dives just before
    the accident as a sort of belly flop and therefore likely parallel to the
    surface of the water.  In my view, this
    would make it even more improbable that he hit the bottom.  Nowhere does the trial judge address whether
    he accepts or rejects this evidence of the appellant, yet it is crucial in
    determining factual causation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does the trial judge address the substantial expert
    evidence about the prevalence, height, shape and location of the sandbars at
    the Pinery.  This evidence was also
    important in answering the central factual question; namely, whether it is more
    likely than not that the appellant hit his head on a sandbar.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am therefore of the view that, in reaching his
    conclusion about the central question of factual causation, the trial judge not
    only relied on irrelevant considerations but disregarded important relevant
    evidence that could have been determinative.  For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellant did not prove his head hit a sandbar represents palpable and
    overriding error and must be set aside. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>iii) The respondent’s liability</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After deciding the issue of factual causation against
    the appellant, the trial judge turned to the last issue: the respondents’
    liability under the <i>Occupiers’ Liability
    Act</i>.  He concluded that sandbars are
    not a hazard to swimmers at the Pinery, and therefore imposed no duty on the
    respondents.  He based this conclusion on
    his finding that these sandbars had never previously caused injury to anyone at
    the Pinery.  However, as the respondents
    acknowledge, there was no evidence to support this finding.  The most that could be said is that none of
    the Pinery employees who testified knew of any such injuries.  Thus, here too, the trial judge’s conclusion
    rests on a misapprehension of the evidence and must be set aside.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D.  CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the appropriate remedy in
    light of these errors is to set aside the judgment below and grant judgment for
    the amount of the agreed damages.  While
    the errors of the trial judge require that the judgment below be set aside, I
    would not take the second step sought by the appellant.  None of the three issues I have dealt with would
    be entirely free from doubt at a new trial.  While there is considerable evidence to support the appellant’s position
    that he hit his head on a sandbar, it would be open to a trial judge to find
    against the appellant on a proper consideration of the record.  Equally, the issues of the respondents’
    liability under the <i>Occupiers’ Liability
    Act</i> and the appellant’s contributory negligence are open to more than one
    conclusion.  Therefore, regrettably,
    there must be a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.  Costs of the appeal to the appellant fixed in
    the total amount of $50,000.  Costs of
    the first trial are best left to the trial judge at the conclusion of the new
    trial. </p>
