  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties appeal from the judgment of Himel J.
    awarding the respondent RF Real Estate Inc. (&#8220;RF&#8221;), a real estate
    broker, $800,000 in commission for work it performed on a prospective real
    estate transaction before the appellant Rogers group of companies
    (&#8220;Rogers&#8221;) terminated its services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship between the parties was governed by a
    contract consisting of a Letter of Representation and a Letter of Termination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the appeal, the Rogers companies contend that the
    trial judge misinterpreted the contract in several respects and that the
    respondent was entitled to no commission or, at most, a $70,000 commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its cross-appeal, the respondent submits that the
    trial judge erred by accepting the appellant&#8217;s expert evidence relating
    to how much work the respondent had performed before it was terminated.&nbsp; The respondent seeks to increase the
    award of commission to $1,600,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) <u>The parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a) <u>Call-Net and RF enter contract</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, Call-Net and its subsidiary, Sprint Canada,
    were struggling financially and were positioning themselves for acquisition by
    a larger competitor.&nbsp; Their leases
    for three of their four office locations in Toronto were expiring on December
    31, 2006, and they were looking to either relocate or consolidate office
    locations. Because of the <span class=GramE>financial</span> circumstances,
    Call-Net was unlikely to enter a long-term lease, but it did consider
    consolidating facilities into one building for a long-term lease, for which it
    would need approximately 250,000 square feet.&nbsp; Call-Net sought proposals for
    representation from real estate brokers.&nbsp; Call-Net selected RF&#8217;s proposal in November 2004 and negotiated a
    contract with RF in December 2004, which consisted of the Letter of
    Representation and the Letter of Termination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Letter of Representation, dated December 10, 2004,
    provided that RF would be Call-Net&#8217;s exclusive broker for its
    &#8220;office space and real estate requirements in the Greater Toronto
    Area&#8221; until December 31, 2006.&nbsp; It further provided that RF would perform the steps outlined in its
    proposal document, which detailed an initial 19-step real estate process
    (&#8220;FLOW Process&#8221;) followed by a 23-step process for project
    management services.&nbsp; It also
    provided that Call-Net agreed to compensate RF with:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>a</span> normal brokerage
    commission for their services by our existing landlords(s) in the case of a
    renewal/extension/ expansion or the third party landlord in the case of a
    relocation, payable in the manner consistent with the real estate brokerage
    practices in the Toronto office leasing community.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In consideration of this appointment, RF will
    perform all the steps outlined in the proposal document presented to Sprint,
    &#8220;Real Estate FLOW Process &#8230;&#8221;, attached as Schedule
    &#8220;A&#8221;.&nbsp; RF will complete
    all project management services as outlined in the proposal document,
    &#8216;Project Management FLOW Process &#8230;<span class=GramE>&#8221;,</span> attached as Schedule &#8220;B&#8221;.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties did not commit to any particular
    transaction.&nbsp; RF&#8217;s President
    admitted that Call-Net would pay RF based on &#8220;whatever deal Call-Net
    ultimately did.&#8221;&nbsp; However, RF
    claims that the only mandate seriously discussed before executing the Letter of
    Representation was a 10-year, 250,000-square-foot lease in the GTA and that Call-Net
    later confirmed this mandate as the option RF would pursue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Letter of Termination, dated December 9, 2004,
    governed the main issue that the parties negotiated, the termination of the
    relationship.&nbsp; Initially, RF drafted
    a letter providing that RF could only be terminated &#8220;with cause, acting
    reasonably&#8221;.&nbsp; Call-Net wanted
    to broaden the grounds and told RF that it would not limit itself to
    traditional legal cause, as it was concerned about &#8220;a significant change
    in the major players, either on your side or ours&#8221;.&nbsp; Call-Net informed RF: &#8220;We&#8217;d
    need to have the flexibility to make further changes while still recognizing
    that you should be compensated for the level of work that has already been
    completed.&#8221;&nbsp; RF&#8217;s
    representative in the negotiation and agreement, Stan <span class=SpellE>Krawitz</span>,
    replied that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We&nbsp;consider&nbsp;all&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;concerns&nbsp;valid&nbsp;reasons&nbsp;for&nbsp;termination.&nbsp; The authentic motivation for having a
    &#8216;cause&#8217; clause in our agreement simply is to prevent new personnel
    on the client&#8217;s side from introducing a relative or friend to replace us,
    based purely on their personal relationship vs. our demonstrated performance
    ability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final letter provided that Call-Net could terminate
    RF in the event of &#8220;unsolvable personality conflicts existing between RF
    and Sprint that would seriously jeopardize the successful completion of the
    Project.&#8221;&nbsp; It also provided
    that &#8220;Sprint may not cancel this agreement arbitrarily.&nbsp; In the event that Sprint terminates RF,
    Sprint will pay RF a percentage payment based on work completed at the date of
    termination.&#8221;</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(b) RF works
    on its mandate &amp; Rogers acquires Call-Net and terminates RF&#8217;s services</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the next several months, RF reviewed
    Call-Net&#8217;s facilities and proposed a plan to consolidate its operations
    into one of its locations, the Atria.&nbsp; As part of its proposed negotiating strategy, RF suggested sending a request
    for proposal (RFP) to Atria&#8217;s owner, Oxford, in May 2005.&nbsp; In the interim, Rogers announced that it
    was acquiring Call-Net on May 11, 2005, a transaction to be effective July 1,
    2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because RF was making proposals to Oxford during this
    time, it attempted to discuss the project with its contact at Call-Net,
    Margaret Perrier, Sprint&#8217;s Director of Real Estate Operations.&nbsp; She did not know about the Rogers acquisition
    at that time.&nbsp; She told RF to
    proceed with obtaining the RFP response, saying that she had clear instructions
    from Roy <span class=SpellE>Graydon</span>, a Call-Net executive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2005, Oxford delivered its proposal and RF
    submitted a report to Rogers outlining that it had completed 13 of the 19 steps
    in the FLOW Process discussed under the contract, though it was not yet
    negotiating the lease with Oxford.&nbsp; Rogers did not instruct RF to proceed.&nbsp; Rogers took Perrier off of the file and
    left RF without direction.&nbsp; Rogers
    told <span class=SpellE>Graydon</span> to stop dealing with RF.&nbsp; Rogers also felt that it had sufficient
    capacity in its existing facilities to accommodate Call-Net employees.&nbsp; Rogers told RF to stop working on the
    project on September 7, 2005, though it also said that it was not terminating
    the project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RF later attempted to arrange a meeting and felt that
    its phone calls were being avoided.&nbsp; Rogers informed RF that its services were no longer required in late
    September.&nbsp; Rogers&#8217; counsel
    sent a letter dated October 6, 2005, informing RF that its services were
    terminated and invited RF to propose an amount as fair compensation based upon
    its expenses and the work completed.&nbsp; RF submitted a claim for $1,300,000 on October 12, 2005, but Rogers
    refused to pay the amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the end of 2006, Rogers extended Call-Net&#8217;s
    three expiring leases for six months because its process for integrating
    Call-Net&#8217;s employees into Rogers&#8217; facilities took longer than
    expected.&nbsp; In 2007, after the
    expiration of RF&#8217;s exclusive broker status in the Letter of
    Representation, Rogers entered a 10-year lease for 62,000 square feet at
    Atria.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RF sued Rogers seeking $2,000,000 for the normal
    commission for brokerage services for a 10-year lease for 250,000 square feet
    (at $8/square foot), which it had worked toward completing with Oxford for
    Atria.&nbsp; In the alternative, RF asked
    for $1,600,000 as 80% of the value because it had completed 15 of the 19 steps
    outlined in the Letter of Representation.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The trial judgment</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge set out the starting point for her
    analysis in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>In the
    case before me, the essential terms of the agreement between the parties are
    set out in two items of correspondence: a Letter of Representation signed on
    December 10, 2004 and a letter concerning the termination provision signed on
    December 9, 2004. However, a number of important terms are not contained in the
    correspondence or are unclear. They include: the mandate of the project, the
    termination provision between the parties and the question of compensation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed evidence relating to
    surrounding circumstances and the intention of the parties and concluded that
    the Letter of Representation outlined a mandate of engaging RF to represent
    Sprint on a 10-year lease for 250,000 square feet of office space.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the termination issue, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>In my
    view, the question of termination is not relevant to the question of whether RF
    is entitled to compensation.&nbsp; The termination provision outlined in the
    Letter of Representation did not address the issue of compensation being linked
    to whether RF was terminated for cause or without cause.&nbsp; According to the
    written correspondence and the testimony of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Krawitz</span>,
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Beagan</span> and Ms. Perrier, compensation was to be
    paid in either event.&nbsp; The compensation issue was linked to the services
    performed under the contract agreed upon by the parties.&nbsp; Janice Spencer
    testified on behalf of Rogers that her understanding was that payment would
    only be owed to RF if termination occurred for reasons other than those listed
    as enumerated grounds by the parties. &nbsp;However, that is not what the
    written words of the contract stipulated. Furthermore, it was never suggested
    by Rogers that RF was terminated for the reasons enumerated in the agreement
    which would have constituted cause.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, on the question of compensation, the trial
    judge held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Given
    the evidence on what services were provided and those which were not provided
    or were deemed unnecessary, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that
    RF is entitled to be compensated for performing 40% of the services outlined in
    the proposal at schedule &#8220;A&#8221; of their agreement.&nbsp; RF should be
    paid $800,000 under the contract and Rogers is ordered to pay that amount as
    compensation arising from the termination of the agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals on the basis that the trial judge
    erred in her interpretation of the mandate, termination and compensation
    components of the contract.&nbsp; The
    result of a successful appeal would be either no compensation or, at most,
    $70,000 compensation payable by Rogers to RF for the short lease extensions
    that Rogers negotiated during RF&#8217;s mandate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent cross-appeals on the compensation
    issue.&nbsp; If successful, the result
    would be $1,600,000 payable by Rogers to RF.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three issues on the appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    trial judge err by concluding that cause was irrelevant in interpreting the Letter
    of Termination?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    trial judge err in relying on the subjective intentions of personnel involved
    in negotiating the contract as a basis for interpreting the contract?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    trial judge err by calculating compensation in terms of the work performed
    under the contract?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The respondent raises one issue on
    the cross-appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(4) Did the
    trial judge err in calculating that RF had performed only 40% of the work contemplated
    by the contract?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The appeal</span></u></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1) <u>Cause and the Letter of Termination</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rogers contends that the trial judge erred by
    concluding that &#8220;the question of termination is not relevant to the
    question of whether RF is entitled to compensation&#8221; and that &#8220;it
    was never suggested by Rogers that RF was terminated for &#8230; cause.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Letter of Termination identified several reasons
    that &#8220;could be construed as sufficient cause for termination&#8221;,
    including &#8220;[u]<span class=SpellE>nsolvable</span> personality conflicts
    existing between RF and Sprint that would seriously jeopardize the successful
    completion of the Project&#8221;.&nbsp; Rogers contends that the testimony on cross-examination of Stan <span
class=SpellE>Krawitz</span>, RF&#8217;s principal, establishes that this ground
    for termination was made out at the trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsolvable
    personality conflicts existing between RF and Sprint that would seriously
    jeopardize the successful completion of a project.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s
    an interesting one, because, uh, up until, um, Rogers&#8217; involvement, the
    answer would absolutely have been there was &#8211; there were no personality
    conflicts whatsoever.&nbsp; Um, even in
    the original stages of the acquisition there were no personality conflicts
    whatsoever.&nbsp; Um, but clearly Rogers
    didn&#8217;t want to deal with us for whatever reason, and so it wasn&#8217;t a
    personality issue but it was we just couldn&#8217;t get <span class=SpellE>ahold</span> of them.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,
    are you saying there was cause under this fourth ground?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m
    not a lawyer; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    - - I don&#8217;t think it requires a lawyer to answer the question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m asking you as a matter of
    fact: do you think this fourth ground was satisfied?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,
    in my opinion, if you can&#8217;t talk to the client because the client&#8217;s
    not responding to you, then it seriously jeopardizes the success of a project,
    but that was brought upon by Rogers, not brought upon by us.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So
    there was - - there was cause, then under the fourth.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    - - they created a cause.&nbsp; Again,
    I&#8217;m not a lawyer, so I don&#8217;t know what the implications of the word
    &#8216;cause&#8217; is, but my concern here was that, um, it certainly was
    never intended this way, and there was a good - - there was good communication
    and no personality conflicts, um, but you can&#8217;t, uh - - you can&#8217;t
    complete a deal with a client who&#8217;s not - - who&#8217;s not
    communicative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission.&nbsp; In my view, it cannot be that
    Rogers&#8217; own failure to communicate with RF and to provide instructions to
    RF about the steps RF should take to fulfil its contractual mandate can
    bootstrap an argument that Rogers could terminate RF because of
    &#8220;personality conflicts&#8221;.&nbsp; This would turn the notion of cause, which is typically quite difficult
    to establish in employment law cases, on its head.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in its termination letter dated October 6,
    2005, Rogers did not assert that it was terminating RF for cause; it simply
    said that &#8220;RF is incapable of fulfilling the mandate of the Agreement
    &#8230; for various reasons&#8221;.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Rogers&#8217; termination of RF was not
    termination for cause.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US> (2) <u>Subjective intentions</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rogers contends that the trial judge erred by
    considering the subjective intentions of the parties in interpreting the
    contract, especially its mandate.&nbsp; Rogers particularly challenges this sentence in the trial judge&#8217;s
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the evidence led concerning surrounding
    circumstances and the intention of the parties which I find to be admissible, I
    am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Letter of Representation
    outlined a mandate of engaging RF to represent Sprint on a ten year lease for
    250,000 square feet of office space.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is Rogers&#8217; submission that &#8220;the
    intention of the parties&#8221; portion of this passage is contrary to the case
    law, especially what <span class=SpellE>Iacobucci</span> J. said in <i>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. <span class=SpellE>Novopharm</span> Ltd.</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The contractual intent of the parties is to be
    determined by reference to the words they used in drafting the document,
    possibly read in light of the surrounding circumstances which were prevalent at
    the time.&nbsp; <i>Evidence of one party&#8217;s subjective intention has no independent
    place in this determination.</i>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See also: <span class=SpellE><i>Dumbrell</i></span><i> v. <span class=GramE>The Regional Group of Companies Inc.<span
style='font-style:normal'> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 616, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.</span></span></i> <span class=GramE>56 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the impugned passage of the trial
    judge&#8217;s reasons does not run afoul of these authorities.&nbsp; In this passage, the trial judge refers
    to the &#8220;surrounding circumstances&#8221; relating to the Letter of
    Representation, as permitted by <i>Eli Lilly</i>.&nbsp; She does not refer to the
    &#8220;subjective&#8221; intention of the parties; rather, this passage and
    indeed the rest of the reasons evince a clear goal of &#8220;<span
class=SpellE>determin</span>[<span class=SpellE>ing</span>] the meaning of the
    contract against its objective contextual scene&#8221;: <span class=SpellE><i>Dumbrell</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    56.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, and of particular importance in my view,
    is the fact, as noted by the trial judge in her reasons, that in his
    examination for discovery Rogers&#8217; representative agreed that a 10-year
    lease for 250,000 square feet of office space was the mandate arising from the
    Letter of Representation.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US> (3) <u>Compensation</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rogers contends that if it terminated RF without cause,
    RF&#8217;s compensation should be calculated, as the Letter of Representation
    stated, &#8220;in the manner consistent with the real estate brokerage
    practices in the Toronto office leasing community.&#8221;&nbsp; This manner of compensation, Rogers
    submits, is an eight per cent commission on any deal completed.&nbsp; Since the deals ultimately completed
    during the life of the contract (until December 31, 2006) were short-term
    renewals of existing leases, RF&#8217;s compensation should be $70,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would agree with this submission &#8211; if Rogers
    had not terminated RF.&nbsp; But that is
    not what happened.&nbsp; Rogers fired RF
    without cause.&nbsp; A specific term in
    the Letter of Termination deals with this situation: &#8220;In the event that
    Sprint terminates RF, Sprint will pay RF a percentage payment based on work
    completed at the date of termination.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, in its termination letter sent to RF on
    October 6, 2005, Rogers acknowledged that it was this term &#8211; not something
    in the Letter of Representation &#8211; that entitled RF to compensation:
    &#8220;In the Agreement, Sprint agreed to pay RF based on the work completed at
    the date of termination.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the words &#8220;work completed at the date
    of termination&#8221; are clear.&nbsp; Their application is also clear &#8211; the only work RF had done on the
    contract before termination was work on the mandate the parties had agreed to a
    10-year lease of a 250,000 square foot building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rogers contends that this is an absurd result.&nbsp; It describes the result in this fashion
    &#8211; if the contract had continued until the end, RF would have continued to
    work and received $70,000 as commission for the short-term lease renewals that
    were ultimately negotiated; however, having been terminated, RF did no more
    work and received $800,000 as commission (40 per cent of the $2,000,000
    contemplated in the original mandate).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the result arrived at by the trial judge is
    not commercially absurd; rather, it is precisely what the parties agreed to in
    the Letter of Termination component of the contract.&nbsp; The reality is that Rogers&#8217;
    decision to fire RF without cause changed everything.&nbsp; What might have happened if Rogers had
    not taken this step, including what deals might have been completed and
    RF&#8217;s role in those <span class=GramE>deals,</span> is in the realm of
    speculation.&nbsp; What is not
    speculation is that for many months RF worked on precisely the mandate the
    parties had agreed to and that Rogers then fired RF without cause.&nbsp; This triggered a termination term with
    particularly clear wording. &nbsp;The
    trial judge interpreted this term correctly: &#8220;Under the agreement, if RF
    was terminated, it would be paid according to the work completed under the
    mandate.&#8221;</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The cross-appeal</span></u></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US> (4) <u>RF completed only 40 per cent of the work</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RF cross-appeals on the basis that the trial judge made
    a palpable and overriding error of fact in concluding that RF completed only 40
    per cent of the services contemplated by the contract.&nbsp; RF submits that it completed 15 of the
    19 steps in the FLOW Process and therefore is entitled to $1,600,000, being 80
    per cent of the projected commission of $2,000,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.&nbsp; There are several ways in which the trial judge could have settled on
    the 40 per cent figure.&nbsp; The most
    obvious is acceptance that RF performed 15 of the 42 steps contemplated in the
    FLOW Process and Project Management documents that together described all the
    services RF would supply under the contract.&nbsp; This would be 36 per cent which could be
    rounded to 40 per cent.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal
    which I would fix at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.&nbsp; The appellant is entitled to its costs
    of the cross-appeal which I would fix at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and
    GST.</p>
