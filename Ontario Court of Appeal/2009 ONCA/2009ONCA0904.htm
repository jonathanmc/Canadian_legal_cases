  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the judgment of Kershman J.,
    dated April 28, 2009, declaring that the property section of the all-risk
    insurance policy (“the Policy”) issued by the appellant, ING Novex Insurance
    Company of Canada (“ING”), to the respondent, Ottawa-Carleton Standard
    Condominium Corporation (“Ottawa-Carleton”), covered the cost of replacing the
    respondent’s standpipe system.  Kershman
    J. ordered ING to pay Ottawa-Carleton $600,000, representing the entire
    replacement cost of the standpipe system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is yet another appeal where the issue raised is
    the interpretation of a policy of insurance and whether a particular loss falls
    within coverage or does not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The applicant is suing for the damage to the
    standpipe system itself, which happened to be caused by faulty or improper
    workmanship or design in conjunction with the water hammer event.  Put another way, the applicant is not suing
    over a badly-installed standpipe system: the applicant is suing for a broken
    standpipe system.  It was the water
    hammer event that broke the poorly – installed system and that breakage
    qualifies as “damage resulting from faulty or improper material, workmanship or
    design.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on this finding, he went on to hold that:  (i) the Policy covered the cost of replacing
    the entire standpipe system in the building; (ii) the governing statute does
    not allow for this type of loss to be excluded from the Policy; and (iii) the
    appropriate replacement cost is $600,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow I am of the view that the
    policy in issue does not cover the loss for which the claim is made.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    judgment and in its place an order should go dismissing the application with
    costs.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Ottawa-Carleton, is a 32 storey high-rise
    condominium corporation located in Ottawa, Ontario.  It was created on September 3, 2004 upon the
    registration of the Declaration and of the description pursuant to the <i>Condominium Act</i>, 1998, S.O. 1998, c. 19.  On September 24, 2005 the appellant, ING,
    came on risk and issued its policy of insurance to Ottawa-Carleton.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ottawa-Carleton owns a fire protection system (FPS),
    which is used to direct water throughout the building’s sprinkler and fire hose
    systems.  In high rises, such as this condominium,
    large pipes called standpipes or risers are used to bring water to the various
    floors of the building to supply water to the sprinkler and fire hose systems
    on each floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the uncontroverted evidence that Ottawa-Carleton’s
    standpipe system was improperly designed and/or installed.  The affidavit of Bertram Blevis, President of
    the board of directors of Ottawa-Carleton, sworn February 11, 2008 and filed in
    support of the application, states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6. On or about January 6, 2006, flooding occurred
    at the Condominium. Although this leak was soon resolved, the Condominium and
    the Owners suffered damages as a result thereof.  <i>My
    understanding is that this flooding was caused by improper installation of the
    standpipes</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.  On or
    about April 7, 2006, a second flooding occurred.  On this occasion, one of the pipes or one of
    the couplings failed in one of the Condominium’s standpipes on the
    thirty-second floor. This resulted in significant flooding to the condominium
    and damages estimated to be $20,000,000.  ING has indemnified the greater portion of those losses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>9. <i>My
    understanding is that this flooding was caused by several factors including the
    following</i>:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       <span
class=GramE><i>many</i></span><i> of the clamps used to hold the standpipes
    were not properly secured</i>;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       <span
class=GramE><i>the</i></span><i> standpipe clamps were found to be
    incorrectly spaced</i>;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       <span
class=GramE><i>some</i></span><i> sections of the standpipe were not properly
    joined together; and</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)       <span
class=GramE><i>the</i></span><i> improper support of the standpipes allowed
    movement of the standpipe structure which caused the pipe or coupling to fail
    due to a water hammer</i>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated in the Blevis affidavit, the direct cause
    of the flood on April 7, 2006 was a failure in one of the four standpipes on
    the 32<sup>nd</sup> floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the flood, Ottawa-Carleton, in the language of
    Mr. Blevis; “… took the responsible step of replacing the FPS” at a cost of
    “approximately $600,000” for an entirely new standpipe system.  It is that cost which Ottawa-Carleton sought
    to recover in the application it brought against ING.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its Notice of Application Ottawa-Carleton sought
    three orders “declaring the proper interpretation of the Policy in relation to
    the replacement costs of the applicant’s standpipe system”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       an
    order declaring that, pursuant to the provisions of the policy, all damages
    incurred relating to the replacement of the applicant’s standpipe system are
    covered under the Property Insurance Section of the policy;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       an
    order declaring that the respondent’s denial of coverage on the basis that “the
    standpipe riser was improperly designed and/or installed”, stated by the
    respondent to be perils excluded under the terms of the policy, is invalid on
    the grounds that the stated exclusion is not effective pursuant to section 99
    of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, 1998, S.O.
    1998, c. 19, as amended, (the “Act”) and cannot be relied on;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       an
    order declaring that the respondent’s denial of coverage on the basis that the
    Equipment Breakdown Rider limits the applicant’s indemnification rights is
    similarly invalid on the grounds that the Equipment Breakdown Rider is not
    effective pursuant to section 99 of the Act;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ottawa-Carleton listed among the stated grounds for the
    application:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… <span class=GramE>the</span> standpipe system of
    the Corporation failed due to the improper design and/or installation of the
    standpipe system resulting in significant flooding damages estimated to be
    valued at $20,000,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ottawa-Carleton sets out in its Notice of Application the
    position of ING that the cost of repairing or replacing the failed standpipe
    (to be noted as the singular) does not fall within coverage because the
    standpipe (again singular form) was improperly designed and/or installed and
    this constitutes an excluded peril pursuant to the policy.  The exclusion is set out as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.  Perils Excluded</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            This
    policy does not insure against loss or damages      caused
    directly or indirectly:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        <span class=GramE>by</span> mechanical
    or electrical breakdown, wear and tear, gradual deterioration, latent defect,
    inherent vice, or the costs of making good faulty or improper materials, faulty
    or improper workmanship, faulty or improper design, provided, however to the
    extent otherwise insured and not otherwise excluded under this Form, resultant
    damage to the property is insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its materials, Ottawa-Carleton then goes on to cite
    s. 99(3) of the <i>Condominium Act</i> which,
    it argues has the effect of nullifying the exclusionary clause upon which ING
    relies.  Section 99(3) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>An exclusion</span> in the
    insurance required by this section is not effective with respect to damage
    resulting from faulty or improper material, workmanship or design that would be
    insured, but for the exclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, before the application judge, the parties
    seemed to agree that the Exclusion Clause would normally operate to exempt the
    loss from indemnification.  Ottawa-Carleton
    argued, however, that s. 99(3) of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i> nullified the Exclusion Clause.  The application judge ultimately accepted Ottawa-Carleton’s position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge framed the issues before him as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1)        Does the standpipe system trigger
    coverage under the policy?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2)        Is the loss excluded by the Policy’s
    Exclusion Clause?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3)        Do the provisions of the <i>Condominium Act</i> nullify the Exclusion       Clause?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>4)        Is Ottawa-Carleton entitled to the
    replacement cost of the damaged standpipe
    system?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>I.         Does
    the standpipe system trigger coverage under the <span class=GramE>Policy:</span></span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first issue the application judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the event for which the applicant now
    seeks indemnification is not the faulty or improper workmanship or design of
    the standpipe system, but rather the water hammer which, when combined with the
    aforementioned faulty or improper workmanship or design, precipitated the flood
    and caused damages to the standpipe system itself as well as the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tellingly, nowhere in the Notice of Application does
    the respondent allege the cause of the loss was anything other than the faulty
    design/workmanship of the standpipe system.  Water hammer is not even mentioned in the document.  Only in the affidavit of Mr. Blevis is there
    any mention of water hammer.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is to be recalled, the purpose of this standpipe
    system is to carry water up 32 stories to supply the FPS on each of the floors
    of the building.  It goes without saying
    that that water would be under considerable pressure and that there would be
    sudden changes from time to time, in that pressure as valves are opened and
    closed – with the resulting water hammer effect referred to by Mr. Blevis in
    his affidavit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case the standpipe system was improperly
    designed and improperly installed at inception.    In  <i>C.C.R. Fishing Ltd. v. British Reserve
    Insurance Co</i>., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 814, the Supreme Court of Canada explained
    when a loss is properly considered  “fortuitous”,
    or within the scope of most all-risk policies.  McLachlin J. stated, at p. 822-23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It should be sufficient to bring the loss within
    the risk if it is established that, viewed in the entire context of the case, <i>the loss is shown to be fortuitous in the
    sense that it would not have occurred save for the unusual event not ordinarily
    to be expected in the normal course of things. </i>[Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing fortuitous about what occurred on
    April 7, 2006.  The system failed to do
    what it was designed to do – it failed to keep contained water under pressure
    and it failed to do so because it was improperly designed and/or installed. Properly
    designed and installed, the system would have contained the water during the
    water hammer incident on April 7, 2006.  On that date, there was no “unusual event not ordinarily to be expected in
    the normal course of things”, to borrow the language of McLachlin J. in <i>C.C.R. Fishing</i>.  In short, the water hammer was not a
    fortuitous event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The system was so flawed when installed it was not
    capable of performing its intended purpose and that was the state of affairs
    when ING went on risk.  The policy covers
    against “ALL RISKS of direct physical loss …<span class=GramE>”.</span>  It does not provide coverage for events which
    predated the insurer going on risk.  The
    policy is a contract of indemnity and nothing more.  It does not warrant the building to be free
    of damage; rather, it insured against the risk of future damage.  The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal put it well
    in <i>University of Saskatchewan v.</i> <i>Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. of Canada</i>,
    [1998] 5 W.W.R. 276 at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>35.       If,
    as the judge found, the building had already been damaged by the design error
    when the insurer came on the risk, the building was insured in its damaged
    state, that is, the subject of the insurance was the building in its damaged
    state. The insurer, under the terms of the insurance contract did not warrant
    the building to be free of damage, hidden or otherwise. It insured against the
    risk of future damage. Another way of stating the same principle is found in <i>Trinity Industries Ltd. v. Insurance Co. of
    North America</i>, 916 F. 2d. 267 (5<sup>th</sup> Circuit, 1990) at p. 270:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The language ‘physical loss or damage’ strongly
    implies that there was an initial satisfactory state that was changed by some
    external event into an unsatisfactory state …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>University of
    Saskatchewan, </i>the defective design involved the use of galvanized steel
    pins (rather than stainless steel pins) to fasten stone panels to the exterior
    concrete block walls of the university building.  Moisture caused the pins to corrode and fail
    over time.  The defect was discovered
    when one of the stone panels broke away from the building’s facade. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The University sought to recover for the cost of
    repairing/replacing the stone cladding under the terms of an “all-risk”
    insurance policy.  The exclusion clause
    of the policy listed as excluded perils “inherent vice” and “latent defect[s]”,
    but excepted from those exclusions “damage resulting therefrom” – as does the
    Policy in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court concluded that the loss claimed by the
    University did not fall under the terms of the policy, since both the design
    flaws (the use of galvanized pins) and the damage flowing from those flaws (the
    corroded pins and their failure to hold the panels to the building) occurred
    “before the insurer came on risk.”  In
    the alternative, the court held that the loss fell under the exclusion clause
    of the policy as it stemmed from a type of inherent vice or latent defect, and
    did not constitute “damage resulting therefrom”:  <i>University
    of Saskatchewan</i> at paras. 53-56.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts in the current case are analogous.  Here the standpipe system was improperly
    designed.  Neither the corrosive effect
    of moisture on the galvanized steel pins, nor the impact of the water hammer on
    the standpipes can be considered “fortuitous” within the meaning of <i>C.C.R. Fishing</i>.  In both cases, the true cause of the
    claimant’s loss was the improper design and/or installation and in both cases,
    these errors took place before the insurer came on risk.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the application judge erred in
    concluding that the cost of replacing the standpipe system was covered under
    the terms of the policy.  The real cause
    of the loss – the faulty workmanship and/or design of the standpipe system –
    occurred prior to ING coming on risk.  Consistent with the fundamental tenets of insurance law, the policy did
    not contemplate coverage for such expenditures by Ottawa-Carleton to remedy the
    situation that existed at the time ING came on risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the application judge erred when he answered
    his first stated question:  Did the loss
    trigger coverage under the policy? <span class=GramE>in</span> the affirmative.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II<span class=GramE>.  Is</span> the loss excluded by the Policy’s Exclusion Clause?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue for the application judge was whether
    the loss was excluded by the policy of insurance.  In his reasons at paragraph 18 he observes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties agree that the exclusion clause in the
    policy would normally operate to exempt the loss from indemnification.  This is evidenced by the plain wording of
    that provision:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>5.  Perils Excluded</i>:  This policy does not insure against loss or
    damage caused directly or indirectly …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)     <span
class=GramE>by</span> mechanical or electrical breakdown, wear and tear,
    gradual deterioration, latent defect, inherent vice, or the cost of making good
    faulty or improper materials, <i>faulty or
    improper workmanship,</i> <i>faulty or improper
    design</i>, provided, however, to the extent otherwise insured and not
    otherwise excluded under this Form, resultant damage to the property is
    insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously the application judge accepted the parties’
    joint position that the loss would, in the normal course, be caught by this
    exclusion because he immediately <span class=GramE>turned  his</span> attention to the third issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this loss is clearly caught by the Exclusion
    Clause and the respondent did not take the position that it was not.  It was Ottawa-Carleton’s position below as
    evidenced by its pleading, that although this loss would ordinarily not be
    covered because of the faulty/improper workmanship/design exclusion, that
    exclusion was of no application because of section 99(3) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>,  1998, S.O. 1998, Chapter 19.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      Does s.
    99(3) nullify the Exclusion Clause in the Policy?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 99(3) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>An exclusion</span> in the
    insurance required by this section is not effective with respect to damage
    resulting from faulty or improper material, workmanship or design that would be
    insured but for the exclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge accepted the respondent’s
    position that section 99(3) of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i> had the effect of “nullifying” the policy exclusion relied upon by ING.  In my view he erred in so doing.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern principle of statutory interpretation is set
    out by Professor Ruth Sullivan in <i>Sullivan
    on the Construction of Statutes, </i>5<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham:  LexisNexis, 2008), at p. 3:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The modern principle says that the words of a
    legislative text must be read in their ordinary sense harmoniously with the
    scheme and objects of the Act and the intention of the legislature.  In an easy case, textual meaning, legislative
    intent and relevant norms all support a single interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor Sullivan went on to explain how the plain or
    ordinary meaning of a statute may often prove determinative, at p. 42:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is presumed that the ordinary meaning of
    legislation is the meaning intended by the legislature.  In the absence of a reason to reject it, this
    meaning is binding on the courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A plain reading of s. 93(3) of the <i>Condominium </i>Act means simply that any Policy which excludes coverage
    for resulting damage caused by “faulty or improper material, workmanship or
    design” will not be effective. The Exclusion <span class=GramE>Clause,</span> relied upon by ING tracks the language of the statute.  Resultant damage is not excluded under this
    policy.  In fact the evidence discloses
    that ING has paid in excess of $20 million in satisfaction of claims for
    damages occasioned as the result of the flooding which occurred on April 7,
    2006.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge’s conclusion that the damage to
    the standpipe system itself was resultant damage stemming from both the water
    hammer event and the faulty/improper workmanship/design of the standpipe system
    is, for the reasons earlier stated, in error.  The water hammer was not a fortuitous event – it was precisely the sort of
    occurrence the standpipe system ought to have been designed to withstand.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the loss for which the claim is made does not
    constitute resultant damage, it is my view that s. 99(3) is of no application
    to the facts of this case.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>IV.      Is Ottawa-Carleton entitled
    to the Replacement cost of the standpipe system?<i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final issue for the application judge was whether
    the respondent was entitled to the replacement cost of the standpipe
    system.  He concluded that the respondent
    was entitled, by virtue of section 99(7) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    “to the replacement cost of the standpipe system damaged by the water hammer
    event.”<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 99(7) provides:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to a reasonable deductible, the insurance
    required under this section shall cover the replacement cost of the property
    damaged by the perils to which the insurance applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its Notice of Application, Ottawa-Carleton sought, at
    para. 3:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An order that the respondent [ING<span class=GramE>]  is</span> accordingly required to indemnify
    the applicant [Ottawa-Carleton] for all damages it has reasonably incurred in
    relation to the replacement of the applicant’s standpipe system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standpipe system consists of four large pipes
    called standpipes or risers.<a href="#_ftn2"

'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  On April 7, 2006 as Mr. Blevis deposed in his
    affidavit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>one</span> of the pipes or one of
    the couplings failed in one of the condominium’s standpipes situated on the
    thirty-second floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only evidence of damage to the standpipe system was
    that one (of the four) pipes had failed on the thirty-second floor.  There was no evidence of any damage to the
    other three pipes which together comprised the system.  In the Boiler Inspection and Insurance
    Company of Canada’s letter dated December 19<sup>th</sup>, 2006 to ING, which
    letter was filed in evidence, it is stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on this information and analysis, the opinion
    received is that the total replacement of the four standpipes was not necessary
    as a response to the breakdown at the Vitaulic Coupling at the 32<sup>nd</sup> floor. The repair of that joint and movement of the pipe above was all that was
    required with respect to the “breakdown” which has been admitted covered by <span
class=GramE>BI&amp;I</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Blevis’ evidence confirms this assessment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is no indication anywhere in the record
    that the entire standpipe system had to be replaced.  The application judge made no finding that
    damage had been occasioned to the other three standpipes which comprised the
    system.  Notwithstanding Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Blevis</span>’ view that replacing the FPS was “reasonable”, both
    the Blevis Affidavit and the Boiler Inspection &amp; Insurance Company of
    Canada’s letter to ING reveal that replacement of the four standpipes was not
    necessary and there is no evidence to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, Ottawa-Carleton’s position, at best, can
    only be that it is entitled to the cost of repair/replacement of the property
    that was damaged “as a result” of the flood and no more and then it could
    recover only if the loss were covered under the property section of the Policy.  For the reasons set out earlier, however, I
    am of the view that the damage to that particular segment of standpipe was a
    function of its flawed design and installation – errors that occurred before
    ING came on risk – and is thus not covered under the property section of the
    Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even if some level of recovery were
    appropriate in this case, there is no basis on which to support the damage
    award. The only evidence pertaining to the replacement cost of the standpipe
    system is found in the Blevis Affidavit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The particulars of the loss specific to this
    application include the replacement of the standpipe system for <i>the approximate amount</i> of $600,000.  Full particulars are available to ING.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No precise cost is given in Mr. Blevis’ affidavit nor can
    one be found anywhere else in the evidence.  No contract, bill of sale, invoice or any other document was filed.  Nor is there any evidence whatsoever that the
    entire system had to be replaced.  The
    only evidence is that of Mr. Blevis who says that the corporation took the
    “reasonable step” of replacing the FPS. And while it may well have been a
    “reasonable step” to replace a defective system that had now caused two
    significant floods in the building, the replacement was necessary because of
    the fact that the system was improperly designed and installed at the outset. By
    contrast the opinion expressed in the Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company
    of Canada’s letter was that replacement of the four standpipes was not
    necessary as a result of the events of April 7, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge made no finding that damage had
    been occasioned to the other three pipes which comprised the standpipe
    system.  He made no finding in relation
    to the cost – other than to say that the respondent was “entitled to the
    replacement cost of the standpipe system damaged by the water hammer event” and
    then awarded the sum of “$600,000: the cost of the full replacement of the
    standpipe system”.  Even Mr. Blevis did
    not know the precise cost of replacement of their entire <span class=GramE>system,</span> he said the “approximate” cost was $600.000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy is one of indemnity and the insured under
    any circumstance is not entitled to recover more than the actual loss.  As Digby C. Jess observed in <i>The Insurance of Commercial Risks:  Law and Practice</i> (London:  Butterworths, 1986), at p. 288:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Contracts of insurance have the underlying
    purpose of providing the insured with an indemnity against his loss …. <span
class=GramE>and</span> this purpose is enforced by the law. Accordingly, this
    fundamental rule of indemnity – that the insured shall recover no more <span
class=GramE>than  his</span> loss – is a
    rule of universal application throughout the law of insurance. The overwhelming
    importance of this legal principle was enunciated by Brett L.J. [in <i>Castellain V. Preston </i>(1883) 11 QBD 380
    at 386 C.A. in the following manner;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote> In order to give my opinion upon this case, I
    feel obliged to revert to the very foundation of every rule which has been
    promulgated and acted on by the courts with regard to insurance law. The very
    foundation, in my opinion, of every rule which has been applied to insurance
    law is this, namely, that the contract of insurance contained in a marine or
    fire policy is a contract of indemnity and of indemnity only, and that this
    contract means that the assured, in the case of a loss against which the policy
    has been made, shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully
  indemnified. That is the fundamental principle of insurance … [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the absence of evidence regarding the
    replacement cost, the only relief that could have been granted, based on the
    application judge’s findings, would have been a declaratory judgment in favour
    of the respondent subject to the proof of its actual loss.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view Ottawa-Carleton was entitled to nothing
    under the property section of the Policy for reasons set out above.  Simply put, the “damage” to the system was
    due to its faulty design and workmanship which occurred before ING came on risk.
     The water hammer was not a fortuitous
    event, but rather something to be expected in the normal course of operation of
    the FPS.  In any event the damage
    occasioned falls squarely within the Exclusion Clause and s. 99(3) does not
    apply.  Ottawa-Carleton, if coverage were
    available, is entitled to no more than its actual loss.  ING accepts that any damage occasioned to the
    standpipe as the result of the flood is covered under the Breakdown Rider
    subject to proof of its loss and the available limits under that section of the
    policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside
    the judgment below and in its place a judgment should issue dismissing the
    application with costs as agreed by counsel. Costs of the appeal to the
    appellant on a partial indemnity scale fixed in the sum of $9,500 inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
