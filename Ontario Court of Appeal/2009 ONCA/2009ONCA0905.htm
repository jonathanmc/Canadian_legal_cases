  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, a father and son, were convicted of
    three criminal offences – arson damage to property, arson for a fraudulent
    purpose, and attempt to commit an indictable offence (fraud).  The offences related to an explosion and fire
    caused by the respondents at their family business, the Tanning Depot, in
    Ottawa, with an intent to defraud an insurance company of $200,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 19, 2008, the trial judge sentenced the
    respondents to conditional sentences of two years less a day.  The Crown appeals on the basis that the
    sentences are disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
    responsibility of the offenders, fail to meet the need for general deterrence
    and denunciation, and are demonstrably unfit in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree.  This
    court has consistently held that conditional sentences are not appropriate for
    serious arson offences: see, for example, <i>R.
    v. Fox</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 2496 and <i>R.
    v. Hirnschall</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 311.  In <i>Hirnschall</i>, Laskin J.A.
    said at paras. 24-26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>I have
    little doubt that the conditional sentence was “demonstrably unfit” when it was
    imposed.&nbsp; I agree with the Crown that it did not reflect either the
    gravity of the offence or Mr. Hirnschall’s moral blameworthiness.&nbsp; The
    catalogue of considerations in favour of a jail term was overwhelming.&nbsp;
    Mr. Hirnschall destroyed a local landmark; he put the lives of several fire
    fighters at risk; the fire destroyed one business and caused financial hardship
    to many others; and Mr. Hirnschall committed the offence entirely out of greed,
    his desire to reap the benefits of the insurance proceeds.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Moreover,
    other than the absence of a previous criminal record, little can be said in
    mitigation.&nbsp; Mr. Hirnschall has shown no remorse.&nbsp; He led no evidence
    to suggest jail posed any greater risk to his health.&nbsp; The trial judge
    ought to have sentenced him to a term of imprisonment. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Indeed,
    a conditional sentence for Mr. Hirnschall seems out of step with the recent
    judgments of this court in arson cases.&nbsp; An example is <i>R. v Fox</i>, [2002] O.J. 2496 (QL) (Ont. C.A.), a seemingly
    less serious arson</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both <i>Fox </i> and <i>Hirnschall</i> were cited and relied on by the Crown in its submissions at the sentence
    hearing.  The trial judge made no
    reference to them – let alone try to explain why they did not govern this case
    – in his sentencing reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the circumstances of the arson committed
    by the respondents are every bit as grave and reprehensible as the
    circumstances in <i>Hirnschall</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arson was well-planned – gasoline was acquired,
    deadbolts to a door were unlocked, debris was cleared away from a door to
    permit entry, a motion sensor was moved, and a burglar alarm was bypassed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Incredibly, the respondents followed through on their
    plan to blow up and burn down their own store even after they discovered that
    people were working late in the adjoining framing shop in the strip mall.  There is no doubt that the explosion and fire
    jeopardized the lives of these people.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents used an accelerant (gasoline) that not
    only ‘accelerated’ the fire but also created a substantial gaseous explosion
    that blew the windows of the tanning salon out into the parking lot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it needs to be underlined that arson always
    jeopardizes the lives of fire fighters and other emergency personnel who
    respond to fires.  Indeed, in this case,
    as fire personnel were searching through the smoke for casualties or persons
    trapped in the building , they evacuated in mid-search because they were
    concerned that the building might explode again.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We recognize the obvious: substantial deference is owed
    to the decisions of judges imposing sentences on offenders convicted at trials
    where they presided, saw the witnesses, and heard all the evidence.  However, in our view, this is not a close
    case.  The trial judge said: “General
    deterrence of course in this kind of situation is extremely important, and
    indeed is of prime importance in this matter.”  Unfortunately, the conditional sentences imposed by the trial judge
    ignore this proposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Fox</i>, which
    is directly on point but was not referred to by the trial judge, the court said
    that the conditional sentence “imposed by the trial judge was unfit for such a
    serious offence.”  In <i>Hirnschall</i>, which is directly on point
    but was not referred to by the trial judge, the court said that the trial judge
    “ought to have sentenced him to a term of imprisonment.”  These statements apply fully in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, a fit sentence would have been two years
    less a day in custody.  Accordingly, the
    appeal is allowed.  Bearing in mind the
    passage of time, the compliance of the respondents with their conditional
    sentences thus far, and the good reports of rehabilitation for both
    respondents, the appropriate sentence at this juncture is 12 months in custody
    for both respondents.  The Crown and the
    respondents will make arrangements for the respondents to turn themselves in to
    custody, failing which warrants may issue.</p>
