  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant has applied to reopen her appeal.  At the conclusion of oral argument, the court
    dismissed the application with reasons to follow.  These are those reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The procedural history of this application is
    unimportant given the approach we have taken to the merits.  There is no doubt that the ultimate
    determination of whether an appeal should be reopened in this court lies with a
    panel of this court.  Having regard to
    the massive material placed before the panel, the 66 page factum of the
    applicant, and her lengthy submissions, we were satisfied that the interests of
    justice were best served by addressing the merits of the application to reopen
    rather than the collateral procedural issues raised by the applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant was convicted of defrauding Legal Aid in
    January 1998.  Her appeal from conviction
    and sentence to this court was argued and dismissed in December 2000.  An application for leave to appeal from the
    order of this court was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada in May
    2001.  The applicant was represented by
    counsel at all levels.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application to reopen the appeal was made in the
    fall of 2008, more than 7 years after the application for leave to appeal to
    the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction and sentence in 2000 was
    heard and dismissed on its merits by a panel of this court.  The endorsement clearly addresses both
    conviction and sentence.  There is no
    merit to the suggestion that the reference to an appeal from sentence in the
    recital that precedes the body of the endorsement somehow demonstrates that the
    appeal was limited to sentence only.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We must address the merits of this application to
    reopen on the basis that the appeal was disposed of on its merits.  In <i>R.
    E.F.H.</i>; <i>R. v. Ringo</i> (1997), 115
    C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused September 18,
    1997, Charron J.A. said at p. 106;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This court has jurisdiction to reopen an appeal
    where an order has been issued dismissing the appeal.  <u>That jurisdiction is a facet of the
    ancillary powers of the court and is limited to cases which have not been heard
    on the merits.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to holding that the court’s ancillary
    jurisdiction to reopen an appeal was limited to appeals that had not been heard
    on the merits, Charron J.A. left open the possibility that this court could,
    through s. 683(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    resort to rule 59.06 of the <i>Civil Rules</i> to permit the reopening of an appeal that has been heard on its merits in the
    limited circumstances contemplated by that rule.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We seriously doubt that s. 683(3) can be read as extending
    the statutory criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal beyond the
    jurisdiction expressly granted in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  We will, however, assume for
    the purpose of disposing of this argument that rule 59.06 is available and can
    in the proper case provide the authority for the reopening of a criminal
    appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 59.06(1) refers to the correction of orders or
    judgments that contain “an error arising from an accidental slip or
    omission”.  There is no error or omission
    in the order of this court.  Nor,
    assuming there is any merit to the allegations, does the absence from the
    appeal file of the original notice of appeal or record of conviction constitute
    an “omission” for the purposes of rule 59.06(1).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only other possible applicable provision in rule
    59.06 is rule 59.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a).  The applicant contends that she did not
    receive effective legal assistance on the initial hearing of her appeal.  She also argues that one of the <span
class=GramE>counsel</span> involved in the preparation of her appeal was in a
    conflict of interest arising out of an application for employment with the Law
    Society that was made very shortly before the applicant’s appeal was heard in
    2000.  The Law Society is the victim of
    the applicant’s fraud.  As I understand
    it, the applicant submits that the allegations of ineffective assistance are
    all based on facts “arising or discovered” after the appeal was heard.  She submits that this brings her within rule
    59.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her oral argument, the applicant went into great
    detail about the deficiencies in the evidence relied on by the Crown.  She also claimed that counsel had failed to
    advance an argument based on s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    which in the applicant’s submission should have been raised.  None of these arguments arise out of facts
    discovered after the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not satisfied that there is any merit to these
    arguments, or that they provide any basis upon which to question the
    effectiveness of the representation the applicant received on her appeal.  They are merely additional arguments of no
    proven or apparent merit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also see no merit in the conflict of interest
    argument.  Junior counsel was involved in
    the preparation of the appeal before she decided to seek employment with the
    Law Society.  She did not argue the
    appeal and, in our view, her subsequent employment with the Law Society does
    not raise any possible conflict of interest in respect of the appeal in 2000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the discretion to reopen a criminal appeal
    rests on a finding of a real concern that there has been a miscarriage of
    justice.  We see no such concern
    here.  We agree with the comments made by
    Moldaver J.A. in disposing of this motion at first instance:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… There is nothing extraordinary about the
    applicant’s case and nothing to distinguish it from the hundreds, if not thousands
    of like minded disgruntled litigants who would relish the opportunity of having
    a second or third bite at the appellate apple.  Moreover, her allegations of incompetent counsel ring hollow; as do her
    serious, but speculative and unsubstantiated, allegations of conflict of
    interest on the part of a former counsel …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='page-break-after:avoid'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application is dismissed.</p>
