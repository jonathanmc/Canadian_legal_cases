style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants were convicted of second degree
    murder by a court composed of a judge and jury in April 2002.  Marcia Dooley was sentenced to life
    imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 18 years.  Her husband, Edward (Tony) Dooley, was
    sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 13
    years.  Marcia Dooley appeals her
    conviction and sentence.  Tony Dooley
    appeals conviction only.<a href="#_ftn1"

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  I would dismiss the appeals.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants were charged with murdering seven-year-old
    Randal Dooley.  Randal was Tony Dooley’s
    son and Marcia Dooley’s stepson.  He came
    to Canada to live with the appellants in November 1997.  Eleven months later, he was dead.  Post-mortem medical examinations revealed a
    shocking array of injuries to almost every part of Randal’s small body.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was established beyond any doubt that Randal
    was physically abused over several months before his death.  Both appellants abused Randal and both were
    aware that the other was abusing Randal.  On the day he died, Randal weighed less than 42 pounds.  His health was deteriorating rapidly.  Randal’s severely compromised physical
    condition must have been apparent to the appellants.  Neither did anything to protect Randal from
    further abuse or to obtain the medical assistance needed to keep him
    alive.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was accepted at trial that one of the
    appellants caused Randal’s death.  Each
    blamed the other.  The perpetrator of the
    fatal assault was guilty of at least manslaughter (causing death by means of an
    unlawful act contrary to s. 222(5<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)).  It was also clear on the evidence that the
    parent who did not actually inflict the injury that caused Randal’s death was
    guilty of at least manslaughter for failing to protect Randal from the
    assaultive parent and/or failing to obtain medical care for Randal the night he
    died (criminal negligence causing death contrary to s. 220).  As I read the trial record, the appellants’
    liability for manslaughter, through their failure to provide medical assistance
    to Randal on the day he died, was beyond any realistic debate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The real issue at trial was whether either or
    both appellants should be convicted of second degree murder.  The resolution of that issue came down to two
    questions.  First, was the perpetrator of
    the fatal assault guilty of murder or manslaughter?  The answer to this question turned on whether
    the Crown could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the perpetrator had the
    culpable mental state required by s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).  Second, was the non-perpetrator guilty of
    murder as an aider and abetter?  This
    question turned on whether the Crown could establish that the non-perpetrator,
    for the purpose of assisting or abetting the perpetrator in the commission of
    murder, provided assistance or encouragement to the perpetrator knowing that
    the perpetrator intended to commit murder as defined in s. 229(a)(ii).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, the Crown argued that Randal died as a
    result of a head injury inflicted within 24 hours of his death.  The Crown maintained that one of the
    appellants (probably Marcia) had inflicted the fatal head injury.  The Crown contended that the perpetrator was
    guilty of murder as defined in s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) in that
    he or she caused bodily harm to Randal knowing that the bodily harm was likely
    to cause death and being reckless as to that result.  In advancing this position, the Crown placed
    heavy reliance on Randal’s physical condition at the time of his death.  The Crown submitted that Randal’s compromised
    medical condition must have made it patently obvious to the perpetrator that further
    assaults against Randal would not just likely cause his death, but would
    inevitably cause his death.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown argued that the parent who did not
    commit the fatal assault (probably Tony) was guilty of second degree murder as
    an aider and abetter.  The Crown advanced
    the position that the non-perpetrator parent had a legal duty to intervene and
    stop the other parent’s abuse of Randal.  On the Crown’s theory, the failure to perform that legal duty assisted
    or encouraged the perpetrator in the continuation of their abuse of
    Randal.  That abuse included the assault
    that caused the head injury and led to his death.  The Crown argued that the non-perpetrator
    knew that the perpetrator would assault Randal with the <i>mens rea</i> required for murder by s. 229(a)(ii) and assisted or
    encouraged the perpetrator in the commission of that crime by failing to do his
    duty and protect Randal.  The Crown
    contended that the non-perpetrator failed to intervene for the purpose of
    aiding or abetting the perpetrator in the commission of murder.  As with its case against the perpetrator, the
    Crown relied on the non-perpetrator’s knowledge of the ongoing assaults against
    Randal and his severely compromised physical condition as of the day he
    died.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither appellant testified or called a defence.  Through counsel, Marcia Dooley admitted her
    liability for manslaughter on the basis that she did not obtain the necessary
    medical help for Randal the night of his death.  Marcia Dooley claimed, however, that Tony Dooley was the primary abuser
    and had caused the fatal head injury.  Alternatively, counsel for Marcia Dooley submitted that if she was
    liable for the homicide as a perpetrator or an aider and abetter, she should be
    convicted of manslaughter and not murder because the Crown had not proved the
    murderous intent required under s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Through counsel, Tony Dooley blamed Marcia
    Dooley for Randal’s death.  He contended
    that the evidence showed that while he got along well with Randal, Marcia hated
    Randal and habitually mistreated him.  Counsel submitted that the evidence established that Marcia had
    inflicted the vast majority of the abuse suffered by Randal, including the
    fatal head injury.  Counsel acknowledged
    that Tony Dooley had failed his son and had even beaten him with a belt on one
    occasion, but submitted that Tony Dooley was not criminally liable in Randal’s
    death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Tony conceded that Tony was aware of
    some of the abuse inflicted on Randal by Marcia, but argued that Tony was
    unaware of the extent of that abuse or the serious harm done to Randal.  Counsel contended that the evidence indicated
    that Tony did not encourage Marcia in her assaultive behaviour, and went so far
    as to tell her to leave Randal alone on the night of the fatal assault.  Finally, counsel submitted that if Tony
    Dooley was party to the homicide, he did not have the mental state required to
    render him liable for murder either as a perpetrator or as an aider and
    abetter.  On this alternative submission,
    Tony was guilty of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellants alleged several errors
    at trial.  They also brought an
    application under s. 683(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to admit opinion evidence on appeal said to be
    relevant to the cause of Randal’s death and the degree of force needed to cause
    the subdural haematoma relied on by the Crown at trial as the injury that resulted
    in Randal’s death.  At the conclusion of
    the appellants’ oral arguments, the court announced that it would not admit the
    evidence tendered on appeal by the appellants.  The court requested submissions from the Crown on four grounds of appeal
    arising out of the trial record.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These reasons will address the admissibility of
    the evidence put forward by the appellants on appeal and the merits of the four
    grounds of appeal on which the court required submissions from the Crown.  Three of those grounds arise out of the trial
    judge’s jury instructions.  The fourth
    concerns a ruling permitting the Crown to lead evidence proving that one of its
    witnesses had made prior inconsistent statements.  </p>

  <h2>THE FACTS:</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A profoundly disturbing narrative unfolded at
    trial.  Randal lived a nightmare of
    parental abuse for most of his short life in Canada.  That nightmare only ended when Randal succumbed
    to his injuries some time during the very late evening of September 24 or the
    early morning of September 25, 1998. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal was born in Jamaica in August 1991.  Tego, his older brother, was born a year
    earlier.  In May 1992, Tony Dooley left
    Jamaica and moved to Toronto.  Randal,
    Tego and their mother, Raquel Burth remained in Jamaica and lived with Beatrice
    Dooley, Tony’s older sister.  Tony Dooley
    provided financial support for his sons while they lived with Beatrice.  By all accounts, the boys had a normal
    childhood while with Beatrice.  Apart
    from Tony’s statements to the police after Randal’s death, there is no evidence
    that Randal was abused in Jamaica.  A
    physical exam in August 1997, shortly before Randal came to Canada, did not
    show any signs of abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tony Dooley married Marcia shortly after he
    immigrated to Canada.  In   November 1997, he arranged for his two sons
    to come to Toronto to live with him and Marcia.  Randal was six years old and Tego was seven.  Very shortly after his sons arrived in
    Canada, Tony Dooley left Canada for the United States, leaving the newly
    arrived Randal and Tego with Marcia, who was pregnant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Marcia had a baby boy (Tyreek) in April
    1998.  Tony Dooley returned home to live
    with his family in May 1998.  The family
    moved to a small townhouse on McCowan Road in August 1998.  Tony and Marcia were unemployed.  Both parents were at home with the children,
    although Tony often found a reason to go out.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is impossible to say exactly when the appellants’
    abuse of Randal began.  There is evidence
    of abuse by Marcia in January 1998.  It
    is crystal clear that whenever the abuse began, it escalated during the summer
    of 1998, and continued until a few hours before Randal’s death.  Tego was not abused by the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal died lying in bed beside his brother some
    time during the very late evening of September 24 or the early morning of
    September 25, 1998.   Evidence of the
    events of September 24 comes from the testimony of Tego, statements made by the
    appellants after Randal’s death, the testimony of neighbours and inferences
    from the expert medical testimony.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal was not attending school in September
    1998.  The appellants kept him home
    fearing that the authorities would call the Children’s Aid Society if they saw him.  He remained in the family home, often alone
    with Marcia – probably his primary abuser.  Tego attended school and Tony usually went out
    somewhere.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal’s medical condition was precarious on
    September 24, 1998.  Months of abuse had
    taken their toll and compromised Randal’s ability to withstand further
    assaults.  Pneumonia had set in.  Randal was suffering various adverse effects
    flowing from the many severe and recent injuries inflicted upon him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On the
    morning of September 24, Tego went to school as usual.  Tony left the family residence at about 8:30
    a.m. to get his car fixed at a garage.  Marcia and Randal remained at home.  Randal vomited several times during the day and was also incontinent.  Marcia became frustrated and angry with
    Randal.  She ordered him to clean up his
    own vomit.  During the afternoon, she
    spoke with Veronica Campbell on the telephone.  Marcia was angry and complained about Randal.  It was not unusual for Marcia to become angry
    with Randal and blame him for vomiting or his failure to control his
    bowels.  Ms. Campbell cautioned Marcia
    against hitting Randal.  Ms. Campbell
    testified that Marcia had complained about Randal’s behaviour on prior
    occasions and had admitted to Ms. Campbell that she slapped Randal.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tego arrived home from school at about 4:00
    p.m.  He found Randal upstairs in their
    bedroom.  Randal was on the floor and
    appeared to be sleeping while sitting up.  Marcia Dooley came upstairs shortly after Tego, and ordered Randal to
    put on a diaper and to “hurry up”.  Randal was required to wear diapers by September 1998 because of his
    habitual incontinence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When Tony Dooley arrived home in the late
    afternoon, Marcia was on the phone with her sister complaining about Randal
    vomiting and taking too long to clean up his own mess.  Tony Dooley had no reaction to this conversation.  For him, there was nothing unusual about
    Randal being incontinent and vomiting or Marcia complaining about Randal’s
    conduct as if it was his fault.  Tony,
    like Marcia, believed that Randal made himself vomit to get attention and to
    anger Marcia.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal ate his supper very slowly on the evening
    of September 24.  He often took a long
    time to finish his meals.  This also
    angered Marcia.  Near the end of his
    meal, Randal vomited.  Marcia insisted
    that he did so intentionally.  Tony told
    Randal to throw away the vomit and the rest of his food.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal and Tego were sent upstairs to take a
    bath and prepare for bed.  After the boys
    finished their bath, Marcia was in the bedroom with Randal and Tego.  Randal began to climb up the bunk-bed ladder
    to his bed.  Marcia told him to come
    down.  As he climbed down the ladder, he
    fell to the floor.  According to Marcia’s
    statement to the police, Tego told her that Randal had struck his head.  She said Randal was making a strange
    “whoa-whoa” sound as he lay on the floor.  Marcia told Randal to get up and go into the bathroom.  Marcia followed and while he sat in the bath
    tub she began to put cold water on his head.  She told the police that Randal was shaking and trembling and that his
    teeth were bleeding.  The Crown experts
    at trial testified that Randal was likely experiencing a seizure caused at
    least in part by a head injury suffered earlier that day.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tony Dooley came upstairs and asked his wife
    what had happened.  She told him that their
    son had fallen off the bunk-bed ladder.  According to her statement, he turned around
    and went back downstairs.  According to
    some of his various statements, he cautioned Marcia to leave Randal alone
    because “he’s gonna get us trouble”.  In
    one statement, Tony also stated that he spoke to Randal before returning
    downstairs.  Randal told him that he was
    fine.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Marcia told the authorities that she eventually
    removed Randal from the tub, took off his wet pyjamas, spread some lotion on
    his body and put him in bed.  According
    to her, Randal showed no signs of any head injury or other medical
    distress.  The medical experts testified
    that by the evening of September 24, Randal was dying.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tego testified that after Randal fell to the
    floor from the bunk-bed ladder, Marcia took him into the bathroom and put him
    in the bath tub.  She began to fill the
    tub with cold water.  Randal was still
    wearing his pyjamas.  Marcia ordered Tego
    to go downstairs to fetch some ice and a spoon.  Tego returned with these items and Marcia tried to force the ice into
    Randal’s mouth.  Tony came upstairs, took
    the spoon away from Marcia, turned off the cold water and the lights in the
    bathroom and went back downstairs.  Marcia followed Tony downstairs leaving Randal, at best semi-conscious,
    sitting in a tub of cold water in his pyjamas.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tego pulled his brother from the bathtub, put
    him over his shoulder and carried him into their bedroom.  Tego removed Randal’s wet pyjamas, put dry
    pyjamas on him and placed him on the bottom bunk of the bed.  Tego crawled in beside Randal and fell asleep
    next to him.  When he awoke the next
    morning and went downstairs for breakfast, he did not know that Randal had died
    lying beside him some time during the night.  </p>

    gone up to the boys’ bedroom during the night at sometime between 2:00 a.m. and
    3:00 a.m.  Tego testified he did not see
    or hear Marcia enter the bedroom at any time later that evening.  Marcia and Tony gave different reasons for
    her trip up to the bedroom.  Marcia told
    the authorities that she found Randal lying on the floor.  Marcia told Randal to get up and get back
    into bed.  He complied.  According to the medical experts, it was very
    unlikely that Randal could have been ambulatory at that time.  </p>

    7:30 the next morning.  Tego came
    downstairs but Randal did not.  At about
    7:45 a.m., Marcia went up to the bedroom to get Tego’s school clothes.  She noticed that Randal’s hand appeared green
    and that his mouth looked different than usual.  She ran downstairs and told Tony Dooley.  He went upstairs, checked Randal and called 911. </p>

    September 24, they heard a child crying and a woman’s raised voice inside the
    Dooleys’ townhouse.  The two neighbours
    heard a man telling the woman to leave the child alone.  The third neighbour testified that he heard a
    male voice coming from the Dooleys’ townhouse at sometime between 6:30 a.m. and
    7:30 a.m. on September 25, yelling “this should’na fucking happened”.  </p>

    sister, Beatrice, in Jamaica, and told her that Randal was dead.  Emergency personnel had not yet arrived at
    the scene.  They began arriving just

    call between 7:25 a.m. and 7:40 a.m. on September 25.  The male caller had a thick Jamaican or
    Trinidadian accent.  He told Mr. Watts
    that he was the father of a deceased child and that he wanted Mr. Watts to come
    and get the boy and take the body to the funeral home.  When Mr. Watts asked whether the police or
    medical personnel had attended, the caller said that neither had been to the
    home but that he wanted his son’s body picked up by Mr. Watts.  Mr. Watts explained that he could not do so
    without following the proper protocol.  A
    woman came on the phone, told Mr. Watts that she was the deceased boy’s mother
    and asked him on no less than three occasions to come and get her child’s
    body.  The same male voice then came back
    on the phone and Mr. Watts again explained that the police had to be notified
    before he could remove the body.  </p>

    identifying herself as the deceased boy’s aunt.  Mr. Watts could hear the voices from the first call in the
    background.  He again explained that the
    police had to be notified and that he could not remove the body until they permitted
    him to do so.  Later that day, two women
    came to the funeral home to make arrangements to have Randal’s body picked
    up.  The friends who made the funeral
    arrangements for the Dooleys insisted they spoke to Mr. Watts the day after
    Randal died.</p>

    needed to cause Randal’s fatal SDH.  Assuming that the force was inflicted intentionally, both doctors
    described three possible mechanisms that could have caused the SDH:</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drs. Humphreys and Smith rejected the suggestion
    that the SDH could have been caused when Randal fell from the bunk-bed
    ladder.  In their opinion, the ladder was
    not high enough to result in a blow of sufficient force to cause the
    injury.  Both doctors believed that
    Randal had suffered a seizure caused by the SDH, either immediately before he
    fell off the ladder or immediately after he struck the ground.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Humphreys estimated that the SDH occurred between
    12 and 18 hours before the seizure, and that death followed between three and
    six hours after the seizure.  Dr. Smith
    indicated that death occurred between midnight and 2:30 to 3:00 a.m., and that
    the brain injury occurred between 12 and 24 hours before death.  Using these estimates, the act or acts that
    caused the SDH could have been inflicted anytime in the morning or early
    afternoon of September 24.  I will have
    more to say about the expert evidence when I address the appellants’ “fresh”
    evidence motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to the recent SDH, which the Crown’s
    experts believed to be fatal, the post-mortem medical examinations showed that
    Randal had suffered a long list of serious injuries.  Many were undoubtedly the product of
    abuse.  There was no evidence that anyone
    other than the appellants had inflicted any of those injuries. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some of Randal’s injuries could be linked,
    through testimony, to a specific event or specific time.  However, many of his injuries could not be
    linked to any specific event. The medical experts could only give rough
    estimates as to when those injuries occurred.  Generally speaking, the evidence indicates that most of the significant
    injuries must have occurred after Randal finished school in June 1998.  Randal was living with and under the care of
    both appellants from June through to his death in late September.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first incident of potential abuse disclosed
    by the evidence occurred in early January 1998.  Randal had lost a mitten at school before going home to lunch.  When he returned after lunch, his teacher
    noticed a small mark over his eye.  Randal told the teacher that his mother had hit him with a slipper.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal broke his arm on January 30, 1998.  He underwent surgery at Sick Children’s
    Hospital on February 1.  He suffered a
    black eye and an abrasion on his cheek around the same time.  Tego testified that Marcia broke Randal’s arm
    when she pushed it forcefully into his jacket.  According to Tego, Marcia told him that if anyone asked, he was to say
    that Randal broke his arm when he slipped on the ice.  Marcia offered this explanation to the
    medical personnel who treated Randal for his broken arm.  She later admitted to Beatrice Dooley that
    she had broken Randal’s arm but insisted that it was an accident. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viewed in isolation, the injuries outlined above
    are not necessarily suggestive of parental abuse.  However, put in the context of subsequent
    events and the other injuries suffered by Randal, it can be safely inferred
    that these were, in all likelihood, the first outward indicators of the pattern
    of abuse that culminated in Randal’s death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 14, 1998, Randal’s teacher noticed what
    appeared to be whip marks across Randal’s arms and back.  She noted at least 25 marks.  The marks were not as severe as those shown
    in the autopsy photos taken about five months later.  Randal’s teacher spoke to the vice-principal,
    who contacted the Children’s Aid Society and the police.  When Randal did not attend school the next
    day, the vice-principal called Marcia Dooley to inquire about Randal.  Marcia was rude and adversarial toward the
    vice-principal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police spoke to Marcia Dooley about Randal’s
    injuries.  She told them that the
    injuries were inflicted on Randal by his cousin when they played a Jamaican
    game together called “lick a lick”.  Marcia
    would not allow the police to speak to Randal alone.  After some further investigation, the police
    decided to accept Marcia’s explanation for the injuries.  It was clear from the evidence led at trial
    that she <span class=GramE>lied</span> to the police during this
    investigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal’s teachers kept a close lookout for any
    signs of abuse during the rest of the school year.  They saw nothing that concerned them.  Randal visited his family doctor in May of
    1998, and the doctor saw no signs of physical abuse.  However, a neighbour noticed welts and cuts
    on Randal’s chest and back when she took Randal swimming in the summer of
    1998.  He seemed sickly and had
    difficulty catching his breath.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tego Dooley testified that Marcia Dooley often
    disciplined Randal when he vomited or was incontinent.  After the family moved to the new townhouse
    on McCowan Road in August 1998, Marcia began to beat Randal frequently with her
    fists on his back and chest.  Tego said
    that on two occasions, while Randal was lying on his back, Marcia jumped on him
    with her feet.  She also hit Randal on
    the legs with a broomstick.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was considerable evidence that Marcia
    Dooley disliked Randal.  She believed
    that he was intentionally vomiting, urinating and defecating to make her life
    more difficult.  Marcia would sometimes
    make Randal eat his own vomit as punishment for this “misbehaviour”.  She thought that Randal was “slow” and
    complained to her friends and sister about him.  Marcia told a friend that she wanted Randal sent back to Jamaica because
    she was fed up cleaning up after him, but that Tony resisted, saying that he
    would appear to be a failure if he had to send Randal back to Jamaica.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to Tony’s return to Canada in May 1998, there
    was no evidence linking Tony Dooley to the abuse of Randal.  Tego, who obviously favoured his father over
    Marcia, his stepmother, testified that Tony did not abuse Randal.  Tony was, however, in the home and
    responsible for Randal’s wellbeing on a daily basis between June and September
    1998, when the worst of the abuse occurred.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tony did admit one significant incident of
    abuse.  In his statements to the
    authorities after Randal’s death, Tony acknowledged that he had beaten Randal
    on the buttocks with a belt in late August 1998, after Marcia Dooley had
    complained about Randal defecating in his pants.  Tony insisted that he had left Randal’s pants
    on when he administered the flogging, and that Randal’s buttocks were only
    “slightly” marked from the beating.  However, he admitted that he had used sufficient force that the belt
    shredded while he used it to flog Randal.  Tony also admitted, after some evasiveness, that he kept Randal out of
    school throughout the month of September, fearing that his teachers would see
    the marks left by the beating he had given Randal and call the Children’s Aid
    Society.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Tony professed to love Randal, he
    described him as a clumsy, accident-prone child with no friends.  Tony also indicated that he had some doubt
    about Randal’s <span class=GramE>paternity,</span> although it would appear he
    was eventually satisfied that Randal was his son.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The injuries that could be related to the
    specific events testified to by the witnesses are but a few among the many
    suffered by Randal.  When Randal died,
    almost every part of his body bore the marks of physical abuse.  Only his scalp, the palms of his hands and
    the bottoms of his feet showed no obvious signs of abuse.  Most of the injuries occurred within a few
    weeks or months of Randal’s death.  Many
    occurred within a few days of his death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Post-mortem examinations showed that Randal had
    suffered at least two significant head injuries prior to the fatal SDH.  There was an older subdural haematoma,
    similar to the recent SDH.  The older subdural
    haematoma had occurred anywhere from six months to more than one year before
    Randal’s death.  Dr. Smith categorized it
    as a significant head injury.  When Randal
    suffered the older subdural haematoma, he would have shown <i>indicia</i> of a head injury such as vomiting, sleepiness and possibly
    seizures.  Dr. Smith testified that the
    presence of the prior subdural haematoma in the same part of the brain as the
    recent SDH made it possible that the second SDH may have been caused by less
    force than would have been required otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The post-mortem also showed some bleeding at the
    front cortex of Randal’s brain.  Dr.
    Smith estimated that the injury that caused this bleeding occurred anytime from
    10 days to several weeks before Randal’s death.  The location of the bleed suggested a contracoup injury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal had 13 definite rib fractures and four
    possible rib fractures.  Ribs on both
    sides of the rib cage were fractured.  The fractures had begun to heal, suggesting to Dr. Smith that they had
    occurred between one week and six weeks prior to death.  The fractures on the right side of the rib
    cage lined up, suggesting they could have been inflicted at the same time.  The fractures on the left side of the rib
    cage did not line up and were probably not inflicted at the same time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The number and pattern of the rib fractures,
    along with the absence of any history of an accident, strongly suggested that
    the fractures were caused by the deliberate infliction of significant blunt
    force trauma.  The rib fractures, in the days
    immediately following their infliction, would have caused Randal tremendous
    pain and made it difficult for him to breathe.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal had multiple injuries to various internal
    organs.  His diaphragm, adrenal gland,
    and psoas muscle – a muscle running from the lumbar spine toward the pelvis –
    were damaged.  His liver was
    lacerated.  Estimates placed the timing
    of these injuries at between days and a number of weeks before Randal’s death.  Significant force was needed to cause the
    injuries to these well-protected internal organs.  The injuries could have been caused by
    punching or kicking Randal, if sufficient force was used, or by jumping on him.  The number and location of the injuries
    suggested that they may have been caused by two significant blows, one to
    Randal’s back and the other to his abdomen.  Some of these internal injuries may have been caused at the same time as
    some of the fractures to Randal’s ribs.  The internal injuries would have left Randal in considerable pain.  Randal would have lost his appetite and
    experienced nausea and vomiting.  The
    liver laceration led to bleeding into the peritoneal cavity that would have
    caused significant pain. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An acute lumbar fracture was also found in the
    post-mortem examination.  This injury was
    no more than a few days old when Randal died.  The lumbar fracture was an uncommon one, and was caused by the
    application of significant force to Randal’s lower back.  It would have caused considerable pain and
    led to painful back spasms.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Randal’s back, abdomen, neck and legs were
    covered in injuries and scars of various ages.  Some were infected.  The injuries
    and scars overlapped, indicating that new injuries had been inflicted on older
    healing injuries.  The shape and nature
    of the injuries and scars indicated that different instruments had been used to
    beat Randal:  some of the scars suggested
    a belt, others the end of a bungee cord, others a broom handle and, still
    others, a hanger.  Randal also had
    defensive injuries on his hands and forearms.  Swelling around Randal<span lang=EN-US>’s</span> left eyebrow and injuries on his back, his upper lip and on one of his fingers were
    very recent and had probably been inflicted within one-to-three days of his
    death.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On top of the numerous physical injuries, Randal
    had acute pneumonia on the day he died, which had come on about one-to-three
    days earlier.  Some of Randal’s injuries,
    particularly those to his ribs, may have predisposed him to pneumonia.  The pneumonia Randal suffered in his last
    days would likely have caused coughing, shortness of breath, loss of appetite,
    vomiting, fever and lethargy.</p>

  <h2>THE APPLICATION TO ADDUCE FRESH EVIDENCE ON APPEAL:</h2>
  <h3><span style='"Times New Roman";'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Overview</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence brought forward on appeal falls
    into two broad categories.  First, the
    appellants led the evidence of Dr. David Ramsay, an eminently qualified
    neuro-pathologist.  Dr. Ramsay’s evidence
    spoke to the cause of Randal’s death, the mechanisms through which the force
    that caused the SDH may have been inflicted and the force required to cause the
    SDH.  In response to Dr. Ramsay’s opinion,
    the Crown adduced the evidence of Dr. Michael Pollanen, a renowned forensic
    pathologist.  Dr. Pollanen addressed the
    same issues as Dr. Ramsay.  Dr. Pollanen
    agreed with some of Dr. Ramsay’s opinions.  In other respects, he supported the opinions given by the Crown experts
    at trial.  The Crown and defence accept
    that the potential cogency of Dr. Ramsay’s evidence should be considered having
    regard to the evidence of Dr. Pollanen, both as it supports and as it conflicts
    with Dr. Ramsay’s evidence.  In effect, for
    the purpose of determining whether the evidence should be admitted on appeal
    and a new trial ordered, counsel have treated the evidence of Drs. Ramsay and
    Pollanen as parts of a single whole.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second category of evidence put forward on
    appeal consists of the affidavits and related documentation of Tony Dooley’s trial
    counsel.  This evidence seeks to explain
    counsel’s decision at trial not to challenge the Crown’s expert evidence,
    despite having conferred with Dr. Ramsay and other experts who expressed their
    disagreement with some of the opinions put forward by the Crown experts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Chan, who skilfully advanced Mr. Dooley’s
    position on this issue, accepts that trial counsel for Tony Dooley interviewed
    Dr. Ramsay and was aware of the thrust of the opinions he now advances.  Mr. Chan further candidly acknowledges that
    counsel for Tony Dooley diligently explored the possibility of leading medical
    opinion evidence at trial, and made an informed and reasonable tactical
    decision to rely on the Crown’s medical evidence, which, in at least one
    respect, was potentially more favourable to Tony Dooley than the opinions
    advanced by the experts consulted by the defence.  Counsel submits, however, that even where
    evidence proffered on appeal was available at trial and was not led as the
    result of a tactical decision, this court will still receive the evidence where
    the interests of justice so demand.  He
    submits that Dr. Ramsay’s evidence, supported in some respects by Dr.
    Pollanen’s evidence, is so cogent on the crucial questions of whether Tony
    Dooley inflicted the fatal injury and the intent of the party who inflicted
    that injury that the evidence should be received on appeal and a new trial
    ordered so that the medical evidence can be fully explored.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Marcia Dooley joins in the application to adduce
    the evidence of Dr. Ramsay.  She has not
    offered any explanation for not leading that evidence or similar evidence at
    trial.  Clearly, Marcia Dooley’s silence
    on appeal cannot put her in a better position than Tony Dooley, who has offered
    a comprehensive and credible explanation for the tactical decision made on his
    behalf at trial.  Absent any explanation
    from Marcia Dooley, or a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, this court
    must proceed on the basis that counsel for Marcia Dooley chose, for good
    reasons, not to challenge the Crown’s medical evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown opposes the admissibility of Dr.
    Ramsay’s evidence.  The Crown submits
    that evidence can be received on appeal only where that evidence, when
    considered with the rest of the record, could reasonably be expected to have
    affected the outcome at trial.  The Crown
    contends that Dr. Ramsay’s evidence does not cross this cogency threshold.  Alternatively, Crown counsel argues that even
    if the evidence is sufficiently cogent to clear the prerequisite to
    admissibility on appeal, it falls far short of the degree of cogency required
    to justify admission of evidence on appeal where a tactical decision was made
    at trial not to lead that evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Ramsay’s opinions addressed several features
    of the expert medical evidence led by the Crown at trial.  As I understand the substance of his
    evidence, it is ultimately offered in support of three propositions:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the SDH was not proven to be the sole cause of
    death;</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>considerably less force may have been needed to
    cause the SDH than was suggested in the evidence adduced through the Crown’s
    experts at trial;  and</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>it</span> is very unlikely
    that the shaking of Randal was the mechanism that caused the SDH.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Mr. Dooley submits that all three
    propositions, if accepted by a trier of fact, would weaken the Crown’s
    contention that the person who caused Randal’s death had the requisite <i>mens rea</i> for murder.  Counsel also submits that the assertion that
    shaking was not involved in causing the SDH would weaken the assertion advanced
    at trial that Tony Dooley, as a male, was more likely than was his wife, Marcia,
    to have shaken Randal with the force required to cause the SDH.  On this latter point, it must be recalled that
    the Crown did not advance the theory that Tony Dooley was the perpetrator: that
    position was advanced on behalf of Marcia Dooley. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I propose to summarize the substance of the
    medical evidence tendered on appeal by reference to the factual issues it
    addresses.  I will then consider whether
    any of that evidence should be admitted on appeal.  </p>
  <h3>(b)  The Evidence</h3>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal;
'>(i)  Was the
    recent SDH fatal? </span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, Dr. Smith and Dr. Humphreys agreed
    that Randal’s death was caused by the SDH.  Dr. Humphreys explained that an SDH of the size found in Randal disturbs
    and distorts the architecture of the brain, and eventually impairs and destroys
    brain functions essential to life.  Drs.
    Smith and Humphreys believed that the SDH occurred in the 24 hours before
    Randal died and prior to his fall from the bunk-bed ladder.  They referred to the fatal SDH as the recent
    SDH to distinguish it from a subdural haematoma suffered at some earlier point
    in time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Ramsay agreed that Randal had been severely
    abused in his lifetime.  He also agreed
    that Randal had suffered a significant SDH in the 24 hours before his
    death.  He further agreed that the SDH
    occurred prior to Randal’s fall from the bunk-bed ladder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Ramsay found insufficient neuropathological
    evidence to “prove” that Randal’s SDH was fatal.  He accepted that the opinion that the SDH was
    fatal was a reasonable one.  Indeed, in
    his own textbook, Dr. Ramsay had indicated that an SDH of the size found in Randal’s
    head was “more likely than not to cause death”.  Dr. Ramsay testified, however, that several features normally found in
    the brain after a fatal SDH were not evident in Randal’s brain.  He said the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>I do not
    believe that the abnormalities that are present in this brain allow us to prove
    that the subdural haematoma was the sole cause of death.</i>  That’s all.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Ramsay advanced two scenarios that may have
    led to Randal’s death.  One posited one
    or more additional assaults after the assault causing the SDH.  The second scenario assumed a re-bleed of the
    older subdural haematoma that arose either spontaneously or as the result of a
    “mild blunt force head injury”.  Dr.
    Ramsay admitted that both theories were speculative.  Neither theory eliminated the recent SDH as a
    contributing cause of death, particularly given Randal’s severely compromised
    physical condition on September 24.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Pollanen agreed with Drs. Smith and
    Humphreys that the recent SDH was fatal.  He rejected the scenarios advanced by Dr. Ramsay as having no empirical
    support in the medical data relevant to Randal’s death.  Dr. Pollanen suggested that, as a
    pathologist, when attempting to determine a cause of death he was accustomed to
    examining a broader spectrum of information than would normally be examined by
    a neuropathologist.  In concluding that
    the SDH was lethal, Dr. Pollanen had regard to the neuropathological findings,
    and to a considerable body of information beyond those findings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence adduced on appeal, if anything,
    strengthens the opinion proffered at trial that Randal suffered a fatal SDH
    within 24 hours of his death.  At its
    highest, Dr. Ramsay’s opinion suggests that the recent SDH suffered by Randal contributed
    to Randal’s death, but was not the only cause of it.  To the extent that Dr. Ramsay suggests that
    there may have been assaults after the infliction of the SDH, his opinion
    hardly helps Tony Dooley.  It was Tony
    Dooley’s position at trial, based on the Crown’s medical <span class=GramE>evidence,
    that</span> the assault that caused the fatal SDH must have occurred on the
    morning of September 24.  Tony Dooley was
    out of the home for much of the morning.  A theory that involved assaults on Randal later on September 24 could
    have implicated Tony Dooley as a co-perpetrator.  His trial counsel was alive to this
    difficulty; it is one of the reasons she chose not to challenge the thrust of
    the Crown’s medical evidence.  Nor, in my
    view, does it help Marcia Dooley to assert that Randal was assaulted more than
    once on September 24.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>                        </span><span
style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>            </span><span style='font-style:normal'>(ii)  Could the SDH have been caused by violent
    shaking?</span>  </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drs. Smith and Humphreys testified that they
    could not identify the mechanism that caused the SDH with any certainty.  As there was no evidence that Randal had
    suffered the kind of accident that could explain the injury, and as it was
    clear that he was a badly abused child, both doctors were satisfied that the
    SDH was caused by an assault on <span class=GramE>Randal.</span>  Neither Dr. Ramsay nor Dr. Pollanen took
    exception to this reasoning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Humphreys testified that based on his
    observations of the SDH and haemorrhaging behind Randal’s eyes, he believed
    that the SDH may have been caused by violent shaking, blunt force trauma to the
    head or a combination of the two, either as part of the same incident or during
    two discrete but temporally-connected assaults.  My review of Dr. Humphreys’ evidence does not suggest that he expressed
    a clear preference for one mechanism over the others.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Smith offered the same, three possible
    explanations for Randal’s head injury.  In his re-examination, he testified that the SDH was best explained “on
    the basis of blunt impact or a combination of shaking and blunt impact versus
    pure shake without or in the absence of blunt impact.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In cross-examination by counsel for Marcia
    Dooley, Dr. Smith offered the opinion that if Randal’s SDH was caused by
    shaking, the amount of force needed to cause that injury was more consistent
    with shaking by a man than by a woman.  Dr. Smith offered no basis for this assessment and the trial judge
    immediately intervened to make the obvious observation that Dr. Smith’s opinion
    “depends on the strength of the person”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Ramsay doubted that Randal’s SDH was caused
    by shaking.  He gave several reasons for
    that scepticism, including Randal’s age, the nature of Randal’s SDH and the
    very limited retinal haemorrhaging noted in the post-mortem material.  Dr. Pollanen went further than Dr.
    Ramsay.  He described shaken baby
    syndrome as a controversial diagnosis in forensic pathology.  He was particularly sceptical of that
    diagnosis in a case involving a seven-year-old child with a bruise on his head,
    which suggested that blunt force trauma was the cause of the SDH.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Many of the reasons given by Dr. Ramsay and Dr.
    Pollanen for doubting that shaking was the mechanism that caused Randal’s
    injury were put to Drs. Smith and Humphreys at trial during
    cross-examination.  They acknowledged
    that shaken baby syndrome was a controversial diagnosis, particularly in
    respect to a child as old as seven years.  Dr. Smith also agreed that the haemorrhaging
    behind the eyes was not as extensive as he would have expected if shaking was
    the operative mechanism. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the evidence adduced on appeal does not
    exclude shaking as a possible mechanism causing the SDH, I think it is fair to
    say, especially in the light of Dr. Pollanen’s evidence, that it discounts that
    possibility.  It leaves unchallenged,
    however, the evidence that Randal’s SDH was caused by an assault involving
    significant force.    </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(iii)  The amount of force used to cause the SDH</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither Dr. Smith nor Dr. Humphreys purported to
    be able to quantify the amount of force used to cause Randal’s SDH.  Dr. Humphreys specifically testified that he
    could not offer an opinion as to the amount of force needed to inflict the
    injury.  Dr. Humphreys spoke of
    “sustained and vigorous shaking”, while Dr. Smith referred to “very violent” or
    “very forceful” shaking.  Dr. Smith
    explained that if the SDH was caused by blunt force trauma, that trauma may
    have involved a hit to Randal’s head by a kick with <span class=GramE>an</span> un-shoed foot, by the side of a fist, or with the palm of a hand “if there was
    enough violence behind it”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Ramsay agreed that one could not specify the
    amount of force needed to cause the SDH.  He also indicated that the older subdural haematoma on the same side of
    the brain may have re-bled either spontaneously or because of some mild, blunt-force
    injury.  Dr. Smith was not asked at trial
    about the possibility of a spontaneous re-bleed of the old subdural
    haematoma.  He did, however, agree on
    cross-examination that it was possible that the presence of the old subdural
    haematoma may have rendered Randal more susceptible to a second subdural
    haematoma in the same area of the brain, and that the second subdural haematoma
    may have been caused by less force than would have been required to inflict
    that kind of injury on a person who did not have an older subdural
    haematoma.  Dr. Smith testified that
    there was a debate in the literature as to whether a prior subdural haematoma
    could make one more liable to suffer a second subdural haematoma in the same
    location.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Pollanen estimated the amount of force
    needed to cause the SDH as “substantial”.  Dr. Pollanen reasoned that any force that both bruised the head and
    resulted in a subdural haematoma must, by definition, be “substantial”.  He noted that had a fracture also occurred,
    the force would have been even more substantial.  Dr. Pollanen strongly resisted any attempt to
    quantify the force needed, or to compare the force used to cause a particular
    subdural haematoma with the force found in other incidents where victims
    suffered subdural haematomas, such as car accidents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Pollanen was not prepared to agree that the
    fatal head injury may have been a re-bleed of the older SDH.  He indicated that there was no empirical way
    to confirm that re-bleeding occurred in this case.  His review of the academic literature
    indicated that a re-bleed was more probable in an infant than in older children
    or adults.  Dr. Pollanen characterized
    the evidence in the academic literature as “anecdotal”, and insufficient to
    support an expert opinion on the matter.  In his report, he observed, “the ‘re-bleeding hypothesis’ is not widely
    accepted”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his cross-examination, Dr. Ramsay conceded
    that there was little support either in this particular case or in the academic
    literature for the hypothesis that Randal had suffered a re-bleed from the
    earlier subdural haematoma.  In oral
    argument, counsel all but abandoned any reliance on the re-bleed theory.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence proffered on appeal does not
    significantly contradict the trial evidence concerning the amount of force
    needed to cause Randal’s SDH.  Substantial or significant force was used, as evinced by the bruise on
    Randal’s head and the SDH.  The degree of
    force could not be quantified accurately.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellants argue that even if
    the “fresh” evidence does not alter the record as to the nature of the force
    required to cause the SDH, it does point out that the Crown experts,
    particularly Dr. Humphreys, used inapt analogies by comparing the force used to
    cause Randal’s SDH to the amount of force exerted in a car accident or a fall
    from a two-or-three-storey building.  Dr.
    Pollanen described these analogies as unhelpful, and potentially
    misleading.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is not clear to me that Dr. Humphreys
    intended to suggest that the force used to assault Randal was the equivalent of
    the force found in cases involving car accidents and falls from two-or-three-storey
    buildings that result in subdural haematomas.  Several times in his evidence, Dr. Humphreys testified that if the SDH
    was the product of blunt force trauma, that trauma could have been inflicted by
    a blow with the hand or a kick.  These
    possibilities do not suggest the kind of force found in a car accident or a
    fall from a height of two or three storeys.  Dr. Humphreys’ references to car accidents and falls from buildings
    occurred in the context of explaining the kinds of accidental situations in
    which the constellation of brain injuries suffered by Randal are observed.  He testified that the literature identified
    car crashes, falls from two or three storey buildings and intentionally
    inflicted trauma as the three circumstances in which these kinds of brain
    injuries have been suffered by children.  This evidence was relevant to exclude the possibility of any accidental
    injury to Randal.  There was, of course,
    no evidence that he had suffered the kind of accident which, in Dr. Humphreys’
    opinion, could lead to the injuries that Dr. Humphreys saw when he examined the
    post-mortem material.   </p>

    bleeding caused by the SDH and, therefore, played a role in Randal’s
    death.  While he accepted that a fall
    from the short distance from the ladder to the floor of the bedroom would not
    otherwise produce this kind of injury, he believed that the fall could be fatal

    affect the evidence that the recent SDH was an operative cause of Randal’s
    death.  Dr. Ramsay agreed that the SDH
    preceded the fall and remained a significant factor in Randal’s death.  He described the SDH as “weakening the child
    during the day”.  Dr. Ramsay also
    accepted that Randal’s fall may well have been the product of a seizure and
    that the seizure “could be caused by events associated with the acute
    [SDH]”.  Finally, Dr. Ramsay does not
    suggest that if the fall from the ladder was a contributing factor in the death
    it would mean that less force was used to inflict the recent SDH than would
    have been required otherwise.  </p>
  <h3>(c) Trial Counsel’s Decision Not to Call Expert
    Evidence</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tony Dooley was represented by two sets of
    counsel during different stages of the trial proceedings.  There is no suggestion that he did not
    receive competent and effective legal assistance throughout the trial
    process.  His lawyers appreciated early
    on that the cause of Randal’s death was an important issue on which expert evidence
    might be of assistance.  <span
class=GramE>Counsel were</span> aware, through the disclosure process, of the
    positions being taken by the Crown experts.  Counsel also knew of the growing concern among defence counsel about the
    competence and credibility of Dr. Smith.  Counsel obtained and organized the information needed to launch an all
    out attack on Dr. Smith’s credibility in the event that they decided that
    challenging Dr. Smith’s opinion was the appropriate strategy.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Tony Dooley sought advice from
    various medical experts, including Dr. Ramsay.  Counsel spoke with Dr. Ramsay in April 2000.  According to the notes of that conversation,
    Dr. Ramsay advanced much the same opinion in his conversation with counsel in
    2000, albeit in less detail, that he advanced several years later in
    preparation for this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other experts consulted by defence counsel also
    took exception to some parts of the opinions advanced by the Crown
    experts.  Several of them took issue with
    the contention that shaking may have played a role in causing Randal’s
    SDH.  Although counsel ultimately did not
    call any of this evidence, the information given to counsel by these experts
    helped shape counsel’s cross-examination of the Crown experts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately, counsel decided not to call any
    expert evidence.  The primary reason given
    for that decision is found in the affidavit of Ms. Mara Greene, lead counsel at
    trial.  She explained that the Crown’s
    theory – that the fatal SDH was caused by an assault within 24 hours of
    Randal’s death – put Tony Dooley in a better position than the opinions
    advanced by experts contacted by the defence, which suggested Randal’s death
    may have been caused by a series of assaults.  Her affidavit contains the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=GramE>[Ms.]</span> Kellway [co-counsel]
    and I were reluctant to call evidence at trial to support the theory that
    Randal Dooley’s death was brought about by a series of less severe injuries
    rather than a single, severe injury (ie. evidence on the possibility of a
    re-bleed due to Randal Dooley’s prior head injury and evidence critical of
    shaken baby syndrome) because of the risk that responsibility for such a series
    of injuries would be attributed back to Mr. Dooley (rather than to his
    co-accused, Marcia Jacqueline Dooley).  My recollection of my view of the case now, some six years later and
    without reading the trial transcripts and the entire file, is that Dr. Smith’s
    evidence on the timing of the fatal injury provided Mr. Dooley with a complete
    alibi so that he could not have committed the fatal blow.  In light of the extensive and overwhelming
    abuse suffered by Randal Dooley, and the amount of time Mr. Dooley was away
    from the residence, we decided that the best defence for Mr. Dooley was to keep
    Dr. Smith’s opinion regarding the cause and time of death [intact] and thereby
    give Mr. Dooley an alibi.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Greene’s recollection that the Crown expert
    evidence provided a “complete alibi” is not accurate.  On the Crown experts’ evidence, the fatal
    assault could have been inflicted on the morning of September 24 before Tony
    Dooley left the house at about 8:30 a.m.  Nevertheless, Mr. Dooley was absent from the home during a significant
    part of the time period during which the Crown’s experts suggested the fatal
    injury was inflicted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the tactical advantage of not challenging
    the Crown experts’ evidence as to the cause of death was the primary reason
    that counsel for Mr. Dooley chose not to call competing expert evidence,
    counsel also had specific reasons for not calling particular experts whom they
    had consulted.  The overall opinion of at
    least one of the experts was very detrimental to the defence, even though that
    expert disagreed with the Crown experts on some issues.  Defence counsel considered that some of the
    experts they had consulted were insufficiently qualified.  One of the experts was seen as having
    significant credibility issues.  Dr.
    Ramsay had advised counsel that he did not wish to testify.  Dr. Ramsay and defence counsel now, many
    years after the fact, have different recollections of why Dr. Ramsay took that
    position.  For present purposes, Dr.
    Ramsay’s motivation is not important.  The defence knew that Dr. Ramsay would be a reluctant witness if he was
    required to testify for the defence.  </p>
  <h3>(d)  Analysis</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    683(1) empowers this court to receive evidence on appeal where “it considers it
    in the interests of justice” to do so.  The case law has developed well known criteria to guide the exercise of
    this broad discretion.  The Crown accepts
    that the medical evidence advanced on appeal meets all but one of those
    criteria.  The evidence of Drs. Ramsay
    and Pollanen is receivable under the evidentiary rules governing the
    admissibility of expert opinion evidence and is relevant to a fact in
    issue.  Both experts are credible
    witnesses.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    resisting the admission of the evidence, the Crown focuses on what is described
    as the cogency criterion.  The Crown
    submits that the evidence put forward on appeal is not sufficiently cogent to
    warrant its admission.  The level of
    cogency demanded as a prerequisite to admissibility of evidence on appeal is
    set out as the fourth criterion in the seminal case of <i>Palmer v. The Queen </i>(1979), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It [the proffered evidence] must be such that if
    believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at
    trial, <span class=GramE>be</span> expected to have affected the result.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In <i>R.
    v. Taillefer</i>;<i> R. v. Duguay</i>,
    [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307, at paras. 73-82, LeBel J., for the court, addresses the
    cogency requirement for the admissibility of fresh evidence on appeal.  He distinguishes between evidence proffered
    on appeal that should have been disclosed prior to trial, and evidence
    proffered on appeal that could not, or need not have been disclosed.  LeBel J. holds that where the evidence
    proffered on appeal should have been disclosed, the <i>Palmer</i> cogency criterion does not apply.  The appellant need only show that there was a
    “reasonable possibility” that the evidence improperly withheld at trial could
    have affected the outcome of the trial, or that the non-disclosure of that
    evidence affected the fairness of the trial.  In discussing the cogency requirement applicable where <i>Palmer</i> applies, LeBel J. refers to the
    language from <i>Palmer</i>, quoted above,
    and says at para. 78:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That test is more exacting than the mere reasonable
    possibility test:  it assigns the
    applicant the burden of showing that the failure to disclose <u>probably</u> affected the result of the trial.<a href="#_ftn5"

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not understand LeBel J. to use the word “probably” in the same sense that the
    word is used when describing the balance-of-probabilities standard of
    proof.  Used in that context, the word
    means a greater-than-50-per-cent likelihood.  In other contexts, “probability” describes a degree of likelihood that
    may be more or less than 50 per cent, or may not be subject to numerical
    quantification.  I understand LeBel J. to
    use the word “probably” to distinguish the higher standard applicable generally
    under <i>Palmer</i> from the lesser,
    reasonable possibility test to be applied to non-disclosed or improperly-withheld
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not believe it is helpful for an appellate court to attempt to measure the
    impact that “fresh” evidence may have against the balance of probabilities
    standard.  That standard is ill suited to
    predictions about the possible outcome of a hypothetical trial that included the
    “fresh” evidence.  The language used in <i>Palmer</i> captures the essence of the
    analysis that must be performed, and I see no reason to attempt to restate the <i>Palmer</i> criterion using different
    language.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    appellate court must determine whether the proffered evidence raises a concern
    over the validity of the trial verdict sufficient to justify a new trial, by
    examining the proffered evidence in the context of the trial record and
    deciding whether “if believed it could reasonably ... be expected to have
    affected the result.”  However, evidence
    that meets this level of cogency, contemplated in <i>Palmer</i>, will not always be admitted.  An appellate court must still address other
    factors relevant to the interests of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interests of justice inquiry mandated by s. 683(1) explores interests broader
    than those of the individual appellant, including an interest in preserving the
    integrity of the trial process. That integrity depends in large measure on the
    recognition that the outcome of a properly conducted trial should be taken as
    final and determinative of the <i>lis</i> between the parties.  Verdicts that fall
    too easily under the weight of fresh evidence demean the significance of the
    trial and diminish the validity of all verdicts.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    broader, societal component of the interests of justice inquiry requires an
    examination of the reason the evidence was not led at trial.  Where, as here, the proffered evidence was
    not led because trial counsel decided not to pursue that line of evidence,
    counsel’s tactical decision must weigh heavily against admitting the evidence
    on appeal:  <i>Reference Re R. v. Gorecki (No. 2)</i> (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 135 (Ont.
    C.A.), at p. 144; <i>R. v. Maciel</i> (2007), 219 C.C.C. (3d) 516 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 39-41, leave to appeal to

    402 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 411.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court has recognized, however, that even where the evidence was available at trial
    and was not led for tactical reasons, there will be cases where the proffered
    evidence is so cogent that it must be received on appeal.  In such cases, the interests of justice
    require receiving the evidence, because it is sufficiently compelling to give
    strong reason to doubt the factual accuracy of the trial verdict:  <i>R. v.
    Maciel</i>, at paras. 50-51.<a href="#_ftn6"

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants could have led the same kind of evidence at trial that they now seek
    to lead on appeal.  As a result, they
    must demonstrate that the evidence goes beyond the level of cogency described
    in <i>Palmer</i>.  In my view, the chances of this evidence
    having affected the verdict are remote.  It cannot reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  As such, it falls short of meeting the level
    of cogency required by <i>Palmer</i> and
    does not approach the level of cogency required by the interests of justice<b> </b>for the admission of evidence on
    appeal that was not led at trial due to an informed and reasonable tactical
    decision by trial counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Ramsay’s evidence suggests that the recent SDH was not the sole cause of
    Randal’s death.  He indicates that Randal
    may have suffered additional assaults after the one that caused the SDH.  Dr. Ramsay does not, however, dispute that
    the recent SDH was a contributing cause in Randal’s death.  Nor does Dr. Ramsay’s evidence concerning the
    potential relevance of the fall from the bunk-bed ladder significantly alter
    the trial evidence relating to the cause of death.  Dr. Ramsay acknowledges that even if the fall
    from the bunk-bed ladder played some role in Randal’s death, the recent SDH
    remained an operative cause of that death and probably of the fall from the
    ladder.  The evidence proffered on appeal
    suggests additional events that may have factored into the causation mix, but
    does not undermine the fundamental proposition that Randal suffered a fatal SDH
    within 24 hours of his death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fresh evidence also does not undermine the opinion advanced at trial that the
    recent SDH was caused by assaultive conduct.  The possibility of a spontaneous re-bleed of the earlier subdural
    haematoma, advanced by Dr. Ramsay in his report, was effectively discounted by
    Dr. Pollanen.  In cross-examination, Dr.
    Ramsay all but abandoned the spontaneous re-bleed theory.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    does Dr. Ramsay’s evidence significantly alter the trial evidence concerning
    the amount of force needed to cause the fatal SDH.  No one seriously contested that substantial
    or significant force would be required.  None of the experts attempted to quantify that force.  Dr. Ramsay and Dr. Pollanen discounted
    shaking as the mechanism that may have caused or contributed to the SDH.  Even if shaking is removed entirely from the
    factual scenario, however, the evidence remains that the fatal SDH was caused
    by an assault on Randal involving significant force.  Dr. Pollanen’s evidence speaks powerfully to
    a significant blow to Randal’s head as the cause of the SDH.  I do not think that removing the possibility
    of shaking as the mechanism, or as one of the mechanisms causing that injury
    would have any impact on a jury’s fact-finding in this area.</p>

    opinion evidence proffered on appeal adds to the medical evidence heard at
    trial on the same issues.  Dr. Ramsay and
    Dr. Pollanen brought perspectives to the medical and pathological evidence that
    differed somewhat from those brought by Dr. Smith and Dr. Humphreys.  However, in the end, the central features of
    the trial evidence remain untouched:  </p>

    appellants take issue with several aspects of the trial judge’s directions to
    the jury on aiding and abetting.  The

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span

    for the appellants submit that the trial judge erred in law by failing to
    properly instruct the jury on the conduct requirement of aiding and
    abetting.  They submit the jury must be
    instructed that to find liability as an aider or abetter, the non-perpetrator’s
    conduct must <i>have the effect</i> of
    assisting or encouraging the perpetrator in the infliction of the fatal
    assault.  In their factum, counsel for
    Tony Dooley argued that conduct or an omission could only have the effect of
    aiding and abetting if that conduct or omission “caused” the perpetrator to
    commit the homicide.  I do not understand
    counsel to have gone so far as to argue that the Crown must prove that “but
    for” the act of aiding or abetting, the homicide would not have occurred.  Rather, as I understand the submission, the
    jury should have been told that before the alleged act of aiding or abetting
    could render the non-perpetrator liable for the homicide as an aider or <span
class=GramE>abetter, that</span> alleged act must have played some causative
    role in bringing about the homicide.  </p>

    as an aider or abetter has both a conduct component and a culpable mental state
    component.  Both components tie the

    that crime by another.  Accessorial
    liability is not inchoate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ argument focuses on the conduct component of aiding and
    abetting.  The nature of the conduct that
    can amount to an act of aiding or abetting is coloured by the mental state
    accompanying that act.  The Crown must
    prove that the alleged aider or abetter acted “for the purpose” of aiding or
    abetting – meaning that they acted with the intention of aiding or abetting the
    perpetrator in the commission of the crime.  This requirement can only be met if the aider or abetter has knowledge
    of the crime that the perpetrator intends to commit.  Without that knowledge, the alleged aider or
    abetter cannot act “for the purpose” of aiding or abetting the perpetrator in
    the commission of the crime:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, ss. 21(1<span

    conduct component that must accompany the culpable mental state is captured by
    the words “aids” and “abets”.  Conduct
    can include omissions.  A failure to act
    where there is a legal duty to do so, what V. Gordon Rose calls “culpable
    acquiescence”, can constitute an act of aiding or abetting:  see V. Gordon Rose, <i>Parties to an Offence</i> (Toronto: Carswell Company, 1982), at pp.

    accept that, as the aider or abetter’s liability is for the substantive crime
    and is not for some preparatory step toward the commission of that crime, there
    must be a connection between the alleged act of aiding or abetting and the
    actual commission of the crime by the person who is aided or abetted.  To take Mr. Ruby’s example, an individual who
    shouts encouragement to another to commit a crime from a distance where the
    other person could not possibly hear the shouts of encouragement could not be
    said to have encouraged the commission of that crime.  As such, that person could not be liable as
    an abetter should the other person commit the crime.  </p>

    I am satisfied that in order to find liability there must be a connection
    between the offence and the acts of alleged aiding or abetting, I would not use
    the language of causation to describe that connection.  The connection required in the context of
    accessorial liability varies.  Some kinds
    of culpable assistance have no causative link to the crime committed.  If “A” holds the victim down while the
    perpetrator kills the victim, “A” could not escape liability if, before “A”
    held him down, the victim had been rendered defenceless by the acts of others.  Similarly, if “A” encouraged the perpetrator
    to commit a homicide and the perpetrator did so after receiving that
    encouragement, “A” could not escape liability even if the perpetrator would
    have killed the individual irrespective of the encouragement.  The varying nature of the causal link between
    the accessorial act and the substantive crime renders a description of
    accessorial liability in terms of causation difficult and unhelpful:  see J.C. Smith, “Aid, Abet, Counsel, or
    Procure” in P.R. Glazebrook, ed., <i>Reshaping
    the Criminal Law: Essays in honour of Glanville Williams</i> (London: Stevens
    &amp; Sons, 1978), at p. 120; K.J.M. Smith, “Complicity and Causation”, [1986]

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    reason for avoiding the language of causation when describing accessorial
    liability arises in the context of a jury charge.  Causation must be explained to a jury in
    terms of the perpetrator’s liability for the alleged crime.  Causation in the accessorial context can take
    on quite a different meaning.  An attempt
    to explain two different kinds of causation to a jury in the same case could
    well lead to confusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    authorities take a wide view of the necessary connection between the acts of
    alleged aiding or abetting and the commission of the offence.  Any act or omission that occurs before or
    during the commission of the crime, and which somehow and to some extent
    furthers, facilitates, promotes, assists or encourages the perpetrator in the
    commission of the crime will suffice, irrespective of any causative role in the
    commission of the crime.  The necessary
    connection between the accessory’s conduct and the perpetrator’s commission of
    the crime is captured by phrases such as “actual assistance or encouragement”
    or “assistance or encouragement in fact” or as the appellants argue, conduct
    that “has the effect” of aiding or abetting: <i>R. v. Mariani</i> (2007), 220 C.C.C. (3d) 74 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 93; <i>R. v. Calhaem</i>, [1985] Q.B. 808 (C.A.),

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the phrases set out above, and others, I am sure, could be used to explain the
    necessary connection between the accessorial act and the perpetrator’s
    commission of the crime, often the plain words “assistance”, “encouragement” or
    “help”, without more, will convey the same message.  This is especially true where it is accepted
    that the alleged perpetrator was aware of the alleged acts of aiding or
    abetting when he or she committed the offence.  In <i>Larkins v. Police</i>, [1987] 2
    N.Z.L.R. 282 (H.C.), Eichelbaum J., after holding that the accessory’s acts
    must provide “actual assistance” to the perpetrator, said at p. 288:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the majority of cases the principal offender will
    be aware of the assistance given by or available from the secondary party.  The latter’s presence, for example as a
    lookout, will be of encouragement to the principal offender and will also be of
    assistance to him.  Even if in the event
    the lookout is not required to perform any active role his presence alone will
    help the principal offender to carry out his part secure in the knowledge that
    he will be warned if anything goes amiss.  Help of that kind, when rendered in circumstances where the principal
    offender is aware of it (and of course given the required state of mind), in my
    opinion is unquestionably within the description of an act done for the purpose
    of aiding the principal to commit the offence [citation omitted].  Thus in the generality of cases there will be
    no need to inquire more deeply into the conceptual basis of the secondary
    party’s liability which will fall within at least one if not more of the
    categories set out in paras (a), (b) or (c) of s 66(1).<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    turn now to the trial judge’s instructions.  The adequacy of his instructions is properly determined by considering
    the nature of the evidence heard, the issues raised, and the positions taken by
    the parties on those issues:  <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314.  As indicated above, the Crown relied on the
    non-perpetrating parent’s failure to do his or her duty to protect Randal.  Clearly, if the failure was established, the
    other parent was aware of that failure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge described aiding as “including any form of assistance”.  He referred to abetting as meaning “to
    encourage someone in any manner to commit an offence”.  Later, he described abetting as “positive
    encouragement”.  The language used by the
    trial judge accords with the language customarily used in instructing juries in
    this province: see The Honourable Mr. Justice David Watt, <i>Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions (Criminal)</i> (Toronto: Thomson
    Carswell, 2002), at pp. 192-93. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also told the jury that the Crown’s case for aiding and abetting
    rested on the contention that the non-perpetrating parent had failed to perform
    his or her parental duty to protect Randal from further abuse, and that the
    failure had helped or encouraged the other parent to continue the abuse, which
    included the fatal assault.  He explained
    how a failure to act could constitute aiding or abetting in the following
    passages:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I should add that aiding includes an omission to do
    something where the accused had a legal duty to act in the particular
    circumstances.  As for legal duty, a
    parent owes his or her child a legal duty to prevent the infliction of harm to
    the child by the other parent where the infliction of harm is reasonably
    foreseeable.  The failure to take
    reasonable steps to protect the child may be viewed as a form of aid to the
    other parent to harm the child. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I should again add that a parent owes his or her
    child a legal duty to prevent the infliction of harm to the child by the other
    parents where the infliction of the harm is reasonably foreseeable.  The failure to take reasonable steps to
    protect the child from harm may be viewed as a positive encouragement to the
    other parent to harm the child.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge put the Crown’s case in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That spouse [the non-perpetrator] owed Randal Dooley
    a legal duty to have protected him from physical harm.  That spouse’s failure to protect the helpless
    and vulnerable child, in light of his or her knowledge that the beatings were
    escalating and worsening, constituted a positive encouragement to the other
    spouse to beat Randal for the purpose that the other spouse caused Randal bodily
    harm that he or she knew was likely to cause his death. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    some cases, the alleged connection between the alleged act of aiding or
    abetting and the commission of the crime by the perpetrator may be strained or
    indirect, raising difficult questions concerning the reach of accessorial
    liability.  This is not one of those
    cases.  If, as the Crown urged, the
    non-perpetrator failed in his or her legal duty by doing nothing to protect
    Randal from further assaults, while aware of the ongoing assaults, that failure
    inevitably had the effect of facilitating or encouraging continued assaults by
    the perpetrator, including the assault that caused Randal’s death.  As my colleague, Justice Simmons, put it to
    counsel in oral argument, the non-perpetrating parent’s failure to intervene
    was not only causally linked to Randal’s death, but was, in the strictest sense,
    a “but for” cause of his death.  The
    perpetrator would not have been able to commit the fatal assault “but for” the
    non-perpetrator’s failure to do his or her legal duty and protect Randal.  On this evidence, there was simply no issue
    as to whether the omission relied on by the Crown “had the effect” of aiding or
    abetting the perpetrator.  Once the jury
    determined that the non-perpetrator failed in his or her legal duty to protect
    Randal from further assaults, its deliberations would logically and properly
    turn to whether the non-perpetrator was guilty of murder or manslaughter.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the evidence and the nature of the aiding and abetting allegation, I can see no
    difference between an instruction to the jury that the conduct said to
    constitute aiding or abetting must provide “a form of assistance” or “positive
    encouragement” and an instruction that the conduct must have had the “effect”
    of aiding or abetting.  In my view, a
    jury would understand from either terminology that the conduct in issue had to
    have somehow assisted, encouraged or facilitated in the commission of the
    offence by the perpetrator.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    counsel at trial objected to various parts of the trial judge’s instruction,
    they did not object to his description of the conduct component of aiding or
    abetting.  The failure to object is not
    determinative on appeal, but does support the view that the words used by the
    trial judge were appropriate to the circumstances of the case.  I find no error in the instruction on aiding
    and abetting.   </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    appellants made various statements to the authorities and others after Randal’s
    death.  In their statements, they
    described their lives with Randal and the events on the last day of his
    life.  Three features of their statements
    are germane to this ground of appeal.  First, each appellant blamed the other for Randal’s abuse and ultimate
    death.  Not surprisingly, their
    statements differed in many respects.  The different versions of events offered in these statements ultimately
    became the basis for the “cut-throat” defences the appellants advanced.  Second, there were significant factual inconsistencies
    in the various statements made by each appellant.  Third, there were factual assertions common
    to statements made by both appellants that the Crown contended had been proven
    false by the end of the trial.  These
    common lies provided the basis for the Crown’s claim that the appellants
    colluded in an attempt to mislead the police after Randal’s death.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge told the jury during the trial and in his final instructions that
    out-of-court statements made by one accused were admissible only against that
    accused and were not admissible “in any way for or against the other accused <span
class=GramE>who</span> did not make the out-of-court utterance”.  The trial judge also told the jury that in
    considering the reliability of the exculpatory portions of statements given by
    each of the appellants they could consider the inconsistencies found in the
    various statements made by each of the appellants.  Both instructions are correct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argued that the trial judge went beyond these two instructions and
    wrongly told the jury that they could compare the statements made by Marcia and
    Tony Dooley in considering the case against each of them.  <span class=GramE>Counsel contend</span> that
    the jury were invited to use the fruits of this improper comparison in two
    distinct ways.  First, the jury was
    invited to take factual assertions from one appellant’s statement that
    implicated the other, and to use them to undermine the veracity of the
    exculpatory version of events given by the other.  Second, the jury was told it could use the
    fact that the appellants’ statements were inconsistent with each other as a
    basis for rejecting as false the exculpatory portions of the statements of both
    appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his instructions to the jury, the trial judge observed on more than one
    occasion that there were significant inconsistencies between the versions of
    events given by the two appellants.  He
    referred to three versions of the relevant events in the evidence: the Crown’s
    version, Marcia’s version and Tony’s version.  This observation did no more than track the narrative of the trial.  Each appellant blamed the other in advancing
    a “cut-throat” defence.  The Crown
    claimed both were liable.  Arguments
    about the merits and failings of the various versions of events figured
    prominently in counsel’s submissions to the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    version of events given by one appellant in his or her out-of-court statements
    could not be used in assessing the reliability of a different version of those
    events given in the other appellant’s out-of-court statements.  To do so would be to use evidence admissible
    against only one appellant in deciding the case against the other:  see <i>R.
    v. Perciballi </i>(2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 346 (C.A.), at p. 378, aff’d, [2002] 2
    S.C.R. 761; <i>R. v. C<span class=GramE>.(</span>B.) </i>(1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 467 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 474-75, leave to appeal to
    S.C.C. refused, [1993] 3 S.C.R. viii. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> I do not read the instruction as suggesting to
    the jury that one appellant’s out-of-court statements could be used in
    assessing the reliability of factual assertions made in the statements of the
    other appellant.  To the contrary, the
    jury was told they could not use one appellant’s statements in any way against
    the other.  The principal passage relied
    on by the appellants in support of this submission speaks to inconsistencies in
    the various statements made by each appellant, and not to inconsistencies
    between the different versions given by the two appellants.  Other passages in the instruction do no more
    than point out the inconsistencies in the two appellants’ versions of events.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second complaint made on behalf of the appellants has more substance.  The trial judge, in his colloquy with counsel
    during objections to his charge, indicated that in his view the jury could
    infer from the fact that the appellants gave inconsistent stories that neither
    story was worthy of belief.  Crown <span
class=GramE>counsel, in their factum in this court, support</span> that
    position.  The appellants argue that the
    trial judge conveyed this erroneous view of the law to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    confess that I cannot see the logic of the view taken by the trial judge and
    supported by the Crown.  Clearly, it can
    be safely said that the different versions advanced by the appellants cannot
    both be true.  However, I do not see how
    the mere fact that there are different versions advanced by the two appellants
    provides any insight into the credibility of either version.  The bald fact of the inconsistencies does not
    permit any inference as to which version is correct, much less an inference
    that both versions are incorrect.  Not
    only is the contention logically flawed, an instruction suggesting that
    inconsistencies between the different accounts given could undermine the
    credibility of both accounts would amount to an instruction that the
    out-of-court statement of one appellant could be used against the other
    appellant.  That instruction is contrary
    to well-established law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    I accept the principle underlying this submission made on behalf of the
    appellants, I can find nothing in the instruction to the jury to support the
    submission that the jury was invited to use inconsistencies between the
    versions given by the appellants in their out-of-court statements as a basis
    for discrediting the exculpatory portions of those statements.  As indicated above, the passages relied on by
    the appellants only speak to inconsistencies in the various statements made by
    each appellant and to the fact that the versions of events given by the
    appellants contradicted each other. They do not invite the jury to use the
    appellants’ out-of-court statements against each other. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the sake of completeness, I should refer to the Crown’s argument that the
    out-of-court statements made by each appellant were admissible against the
    other appellant for a limited purpose.  The Crown contended that there was a basis in the evidence for a finding
    that Marcia and Tony told the same lies about some of the circumstances that
    were material to the investigation of Randal’s death.  The Crown argued that these common falsehoods
    were indicative of a shared plan to cover up what had happened to Randal.  The Crown submitted that the appellants’
    joint attempt to cover up the circumstances surrounding Randal’s abuse and
    death could be used as evidence against both appellants, implicating them in
    the homicide: see <i>R. v. Trotta </i>(2004),
    190 C.C.C. (3d) 199 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 63-67, rev’d on other grounds,

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not refer to the common falsehoods in the appellants’
    statements as being capable of providing a stand-alone basis for a finding of
    collusion and an attempt to mislead the police as to the circumstances of
    Randal’s death.  The trial judge did,
    however, instruct the jury more generally concerning the evidence of a “cover
    up” by the appellants after Randal’s death.  He referred to various parts of the evidence including things said by
    the appellants and their attempt to have Randal’s body removed from their home
    before the police arrived.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge told the jury that if they determined that the appellants’ jointly
    attempted to cover up the circumstances surrounding Randal’s death and his
    prior abuse, the jury could use the evidence of the “cover up” to criminally
    implicate both appellants in the homicide.  The trial judge emphasized, however, that the “cover up” evidence could
    only assist in proving manslaughter and not murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge could have explained to the jury that they could also use evidence
    of any lies common to the statements of both appellants in deciding whether
    there was a joint attempt to “cover up” the circumstances of Randal’s
    death.  To the extent that the trial
    judge addressed the “cover up” at a more general level and did not make
    explicit the potential connection between the common falsehoods, standing
    alone, and a finding of collusion, his instructions did not prejudice the
    appellants.        </p>

    to her on several occasions that she had abused Randal.  Crown counsel put it to Ms. Williams that on

    should not have been allowed to recall Ms. Ogle and Chris Dooley to contradict
    Ms. Williams’ denials that she had told those two individuals that Marcia
    Dooley had admitted to specific acts of abuse against Randal.  Ms. Henein acknowledges that once the trial
    judge declared Ms. Williams hostile, the Crown was entitled to cross-examine
    her on her alleged statements.  However,
    Ms. Henein submits that after Ms. Williams denied making those statements in
    cross-examination, the collateral fact rule foreclosed the Crown from calling
    evidence to establish that she had made them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    testimony of Chris Dooley and Ms. Ogle, contradicting Ms. Williams’ denial that
    she had related Marcia Dooley’s admissions to <span class=GramE>them,</span> was not evidence that Marcia Dooley had made those admissions, much less that
    Marcia Dooley had actually done the acts referred to in those admissions.  That evidence was admissible only to
    undermine Ms. Williams’ credibility by demonstrating that she had made the
    statements that she denied making in her cross-examination by the Crown.  Under any definition of the collateral fact
    rule, Ms. Williams’ credibility was a collateral matter in this trial:  David M. Paciocco &amp; Lee Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i>, 5th ed. (Toronto:
    Irwin Law, 2008), at pp. 434-35. <i> </i>I do not agree, however, that because Ms.
    Williams’ credibility was collateral, the Crown was foreclosed from impeaching
    her credibility by leading evidence of her prior statements that were
    inconsistent with her testimony. </p>

    Williams was cross-examined at large pursuant to the trial judge’s finding of
    hostility.  Section 11 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.

    that proof can be given the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient

    11 permits a cross-examiner to call evidence to prove a prior inconsistent
    statement after giving the witness notice of the statement and an opportunity
    to acknowledge having made the statement.  Evidence of the prior inconsistent statement can be led, however, only
    where the statement is “relative to the subject-matter of the case”.  The alleged statements to Ms. Ogle and Chris
    Dooley related to admissions, allegedly made by Marcia Dooley to Ms. Williams,
    of repeated and serious abuse of Randal.  The subject matter of the admissions allegedly made to Ms. Williams was
    clearly relevant to the case against Marcia Dooley.  Section 11 speaks to the relevance of the
    content of the prior statements in the proceedings and not to the evidentiary
    value flowing from the making of the prior statements: see <i>R. v. Bernier</i> (2007), 229 C.C.C. (3d) 364 (Q.C.A.), at paras.

    evidence the Crown sought to elicit from Chris Dooley and Ms. Ogle when it
    recalled those witnesses fell within the ambit of s. 11 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, even though the
    evidence itself was relevant only to Ms. Williams’ credibility.  My determination that the evidence fell
    within the strict ambit of s. 11 does not, however, end the admissibility
    inquiry.  I turn to Ms. Henein’s second
    argument. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her second argument, counsel relies on the trial judge’s discretion to prohibit
    cross-examination, even cross-examination that is technically allowed by s. 11
    (or s. 9(1)) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  Ms. Henein argues that Ms. Williams’
    credibility was of minimal significance, if any, in this trial and that proof
    that she had made a prior inconsistent statement, thereby adversely affecting
    her credibility, had virtually no value in this trial.  She contrasts the minimal potential
    significance of Ms. Williams’ credibility with the powerful potential for misuse
    of this evidence.  Ms. Henein forcefully
    argues that despite any limiting instruction, it was almost inevitable that the
    jury would take this evidence, given by Marcia Dooley’s brother-in-law and
    cousin, as admissions by Marcia Dooley that she had committed repeated serious
    assaults against Randal.  Ms. Henein
    stresses that the prejudice could only have been heightened by the graphic
    description of some of the abuse, particularly the description of the manner in
    which Marcia broke Randal’s arm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    trial judge has the discretion to prohibit the Crown from calling evidence to
    prove a prior inconsistent statement, even where the requirements of s. 11 (or
    s. 9(1)) have been met.  Those sections
    are permissive and subject to an overriding exclusionary discretion: <i>R. v. Cassibo</i> (1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 498
    (Ont. C.A.), at p. 522; <i>R. v. Carpenter

    trial judge’s discretion under s. 11(or s. 9(1)) to prohibit the Crown from
    leading evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is best understood as one
    example of the overriding evidentiary principle that excludes evidence adduced
    by the Crown where the prejudicial potential of that evidence exceeds its
    probative value.  This exclusionary
    principle underlies the law of evidence and has probably achieved a
    constitutional status:  H. Stewart,
    “Section 7 of the Charter and the Common Law Rules of Evidence” (2008), 40 Sup.
    Ct. L. Rev. (2d) 415, at pp. 424-25.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    first to the probative side of the ledger, I think Ms. Williams was a necessary
    Crown witness.  This is not a case like <i>R. v. Fraser</i> (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 551
    (B.C.C.A.), at p. 558, where it could be said that the Crown called the witness
    solely to impeach that witness and place the contents of their prior statement
    before the jury.  Nor is this a case like <i>R. v. Soobrian</i> (1994), 96 C.C.C. (3d)
    208 (Ont. C.A.), where the Crown sought to use the impeachment process to
    suggest, without any evidentiary support, that the witness and the accused had
    colluded to misrepresent the truth.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Williams had relevant evidence to give.  She spent a great deal of time with Randal over the months leading up to
    May 1998.  She could describe Randal’s
    physical and emotional state up to May 1998.  She also spoke with Marcia several times after Randal’s death and
    discussed matters pertinent to his death.  The Crown was entitled to call Ms. Williams to elicit relevant evidence
    from her and to give her the opportunity to testify as to statements that the
    Crown had a good-faith reason to believe had been made to her by Marcia
    Dooley.  This is so even though the Crown
    knew she would in all likelihood deny having made certain statements to Ms.
    Ogle and Chris Dooley.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    proposed evidence had some legitimate impeachment value.  Although Ms. Williams had given some evidence
    that could assist the Crown, she had resisted any attempt to tie Marcia Dooley
    to any mistreatment of Randal.  Ms.
    Williams went so far as to testify that Marcia Dooley looked after her children
    on many occasions.  This was nothing less
    than an implicit assertion that Marcia Dooley was a good mother.  The Crown had to challenge Ms. Williams’
    credibility in this area.  It did so
    through a vigorous cross-examination.  When
    she denied making certain statements that contained admissions of abuse by Marcia,
    the Crown sought to move to the second step of the impeachment process and
    prove that those statements had in fact been made.  Clearly, those statements had the real
    potential to undermine Ms. Williams’ testimony that she had no reason to
    connect Marcia to any abuse of Randal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moving
    to the prejudicial side of the admissibility equation, it is undeniable that if
    the jury took the contents of the statements as evidence of admissions actually
    made by Marcia, the admissibility of that evidence would have prejudiced Marcia
    Dooley.  The trial judge was alive to
    that risk.  He repeatedly and clearly
    told the jury that the evidence of the statements allegedly made by Ms.
    Williams to Ms. Ogle and Chris Dooley was admissible only in respect of Ms.
    Williams’ credibility and was not evidence against Marcia Dooley.  He first provided this instruction
    immediately after Ms. Ogle testified concerning the statements made to her,
    again after Christopher Dooley testified concerning the statements made to him
    and, yet again, a third time in his closing instructions.  The last words the jury heard on this matter
    from the trial judge were that “[t]<span class=GramE>he</span> hearsay
    utterances [statements made by Williams to Ms. Ogle and Chris Dooley] were in
    no way admissible for or against the accused Marcia Dooley.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would be naïve to think that a trial judge’s instructions can always eliminate
    the potential prejudice flowing from the misuse of evidence.  It would be cynical and entirely contrary to
    the long accepted notion of limited admissibility to assume that a judge’s
    instructions serve no prophylactic purpose.  In <i>R. v. Mariani</i>, at p. 91,<i> </i>the court accepted that a “strong and
    clear” mid-trial instruction to the jury would go a long way to alleviate any potential
    prejudice from the misuse of the evidence of a prior inconsistent
    statement.  This trial judge gave that
    kind of instruction twice and also provided a clear instruction in his final
    directions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown
    counsel also argues that there was a great deal of admissible evidence showing
    that Marcia Dooley repeatedly abused Randal over a prolonged period of time.  Counsel submits that the contents of the
    alleged statements made to Ms. Williams were simply more of the same, insofar
    as the evidence of Marcia’s abuse of Randal was concerned. There is some merit
    to this argument, although I hesitate to accept the contention that Ms. Dooley
    is somehow less prejudiced by the jury’s potential misuse of the evidence
    because there was other evidence that could properly have been used to arrive
    at the same result.  Clearly, if the jury
    misused this evidence and took it as admissions of serious abuse by Marcia
    Dooley, that misused evidence could well have factored into the jury’s
    deliberations.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    probative value/prejudicial effect assessment is not a mathematical one.  Different trial judges will come to different
    values and different ultimate assessments.  Considerable deference is owed to those assessments absent an error in
    principle or a misapprehension of the evidence.  I see neither here.  I would yield
    to the trial judge’s assessments that the evidence could be received and that
    the potential prejudice could be effectively controlled by repeated and strong
    limiting instructions.</p>

    detailing the ongoing and serious abuse of Randal unavoidably permeated the
    evidence at trial.  The nature and extent
    of Randal’s abuse, each appellant’s role in inflicting that abuse, and their
    knowledge of the other’s abuse were relevant to almost every significant issue
    at trial.  For example, it was important
    to the Crown’s case against both the perpetrator of the alleged fatal assault
    and the alleged aider and abetter to show that Randal was the victim of a
    pattern of escalating abuse at the time of his death.  That evidence was relevant to both the
    perpetrator’s and aider or abetter’s knowledge of the likelihood of death
    should further assaults be inflicted on Randal.  Proof of that knowledge was essential to the murder charge against both
    appellants.  </p>

    centrality of the evidence of Randal’s abuse to the case, and the disturbing
    nature of that evidence, made it essential that the trial judge both tell the
    jury what use they could make of that evidence and caution them against certain
    prohibited uses of it.  This ground of
    appeal centres around the adequacy of the latter part of that instruction,
    known in jury-instruction parlance as the limiting instruction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    submits that the trial judge’s instructions were confusing in that they began
    by cautioning the jury against propensity reasoning based on the evidence of
    abuse, but then moved to an instruction inviting propensity reasoning from that
    evidence.  The trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You must not infer from a prior crime that a person
    has a propensity to commit the same or subsequent crimes.  However, where the person commits a pattern
    of similar conduct, particularly against the same victim, it is open to you to
    infer that that person has subsequently repeated the similar conduct and has
    committed that or a similar conduct against the same victim, particularly where
    the motivation is the same, for example, to discipline the child, and
    particularly where the person has a strong dislike of the child.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no error in this instruction.  The
    trial judge began with a caution against using evidence of a general propensity
    to commit criminal acts to infer the commission of a particular criminal act.  He went on, however, to tell the jury that it
    could infer that an accused acted in a certain way toward Randal based on
    evidence that the accused had acted in the same or similar way toward Randal in
    the same circumstances on prior occasions.  The instruction captures the difference, highlighted in <i>R. v. Handy</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at
    paras. 89-91, between prohibited general propensity reasoning, and
    situation-specific propensity reasoning, which is justified where the
    propensity operates in a closely defined and circumscribed context, for
    example, physical abuse within the family unit of the same child during the
    same period of time.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellants also submit that the trial judge failed to caution the jury
    against improperly convicting the appellants based on their prior abuse and
    neglect of Randal, rather than on their involvement in the specific assault
    that caused his death. <span class=GramE>Counsel submit</span> that, in the
    absence of a strong limiting instruction, the jury may have moved directly from
    the powerful evidence indicting the appellants for the prior abuse of Randal to
    its verdict without coming to grips with the difficult problems surrounding
    responsibility for the fatal assault.  Counsel argue that this risk of moral prejudice was particularly high
    given the serious nature of the prior abuse, the overwhelming evidence that
    both appellants engaged in it and were aware of it, the close connection
    between the ongoing abuse and Randal’s death, and the absence of evidence
    speaking directly to the fatal injury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    concern described by counsel was a very real one at this trial.  There were different ways to address that
    concern.  Counsel for both appellants and
    the Crown at trial confronted the concern directly, and urged the jury not to
    arrive at a verdict based on the appellants’ prior conduct toward Randal.  The trial judge referred to these submissions
    in the course of summarizing the positions of the accused at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not directly address the risk that the jury would convict based
    on the outrage engendered by the prior abuse.  He did, however, repeatedly tell the jury that the appellants’ liability
    for murder either as a perpetrator or an aider and abetter depended on their
    involvement in and connection to the fatal assault.  For example, in explaining the burden of
    proof as applied to the perpetrator, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
    identity and that is an issue in this case – who unlawfully assaulted Randal
    Dooley, who, if you make that finding of fact that it was a shaking and perhaps
    combined with a slap to the head or something of the sort, identity of the
    person who did that is clearly an issue.  They must prove that beyond a reasonable doubt ….</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    after discussing the evidence of the prior abuse as it related to both appellants,
    the trial judge reminded them as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Y]ou must keep in mind the fact that a particular
    accused committed the majority of the prior assaults does not necessarily prove
    that the accused committed the final assault that caused Randal Dooley’s
    death.  In the end, you must be satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt as to which accused committed the final assault that
    caused Randal Dooley’s death in order to convict that accused as a principal
    offender of second degree murder …. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    objection raised on appeal is to the trial judge’s failure to specifically
    instruct the jury not to convict based solely on the prior abuse.  It was not made at trial.  While an admonition by the trial judge along
    the lines of those delivered by all counsel at trial would have been entirely
    appropriate, I cannot say that its absence results in reversible
    non-direction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[176]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s explanation connecting liability for murder to culpability in the
    fatal assault, repeated at several different phases of the instructions, made
    it clear to the jury that in arriving at its verdict it must come to grips with
    the evidence pertaining to the final assault and the liability of the
    appellants for that final assault.  The
    failure of the trial judge to say everything that could properly be said in a
    jury instruction is not reversible error.  The appellants have not convinced me that, absent the instruction they
    seek, the jury could have ignored the trial judge’s instructions tying
    culpability to the final assault and convicted based on responsibility for the
    earlier assaults.  </p>

    the period of parole ineligibility imposed on Marcia, five years greater than
    that imposed on Tony Dooley, went beyond the appropriate range, even having
    regard to the deference owed to the trial judge.  When pressed in oral argument, she suggested

    years.  I can see no error in principle
    or misapprehension of the evidence.  Nor

    of this appeal is inordinately long.  The
    delay is explained by three things.  First, problems arose in obtaining the transcript from the court
    reporter.  Despite court orders that
    threatened various sanctions, a working copy of the transcript was not produced
    until well into 2005.  Second, some time
    after the trial was <span class=GramE>completed,</span> the competence of Dr.
    Smith, the pathologist who performed the autopsy and testified for the Crown
    became a matter of concern.  In 2004, the
    Attorney General ordered a review of Dr. Smith’s cases, including this one.  All parties agreed that the perfection of
    this appeal should await the outcome of that review.  An inquiry headed by Goudge J.A. flowed from
    that review:  Ontario, Inquiry into
    Pediatric Forensic Pathology in Ontario, <i>Report</i> (Toronto: Queen’s Printer, 2008) [The Goudge Report].  Lastly, preparation of proposed fresh
    evidence relating to the cause of death and cross-examination on that evidence
    took some time.  </p>

    criticized by Goudge J.A. in his report (<i>supra</i>,
    note 1), I do not understand the appellants to challenge Dr. Smith’s competence
    as it relates to the autopsy of Randal’s body.  They do, however, in the fresh evidence application challenge some of
    the opinions advanced by Dr. Smith.  The
    Crown and the appellants agree that Dr. Smith’s autopsy of Randal’s body was
    reviewed as part of the review ordered by the Attorney General in 2004.  The initial reviewer, Dr. John Butt, did not
    take issue with Dr. Smith’s opinions or indicate that the post-mortem was
    performed incompetently.</p>

    contributed to Randal’s death.  Based on
    the medical assessments done post-conviction, it is now agreed by both parties
    that there was no brain stem damage.  I
    do not understand the appellants to contend that this error on its own is of
    any significance.    </p>

    appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1998] 3 S.C.R. vi, can be read as holding that
    evidence should be admissible if it clears the level of cogency required by <i>Palmer</i>, even where that evidence could
    have been available at trial had due diligence been exercised.  <i>Dalton</i> precedes this court’s decisions in <i>Maciel</i> and <i>Truscott</i>.  <span class=GramE>In any event, <i>Dalton</i>, at paras.</span> 140-<span
class=GramE>45,</span> attributed a degree of cogency to the proffered evidence
    that may well have cleared the heightened degree of cogency required by this
    court.  Furthermore, there was a serious
    question in <i>Dalton </i>whether the
    failure to lead the evidence at trial was the result of any lack of due
    diligence: see paras. 135-39.  </p>

    omission.  Counsel argued, however, that
    presence of the non-perpetrator was a prerequisite to liability as an aider or
    abetter where that liability was based on an omission.  The presence of the non-perpetrator when the
    offence is committed will have important evidentiary significance, particularly
    with respect to the <i>mens rea</i> component of accessorial liability.  I
    see no doctrinal reason and nothing in the language of s. 21(1) that would make
    presence a prerequisite to that liability.  I do not read <i>R. v. Poppen</i> (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 232 (Ont. C.A.), as announcing a principle of general
    application.  I understand Martin J.A. to
    hold, at pp. 236-39, that in the circumstances of that case the Crown could not
    prove, given that the husband was never present during any of the assaults,
    that the husband’s failure to intervene and protect the child from his wife made
    him an accessory to her homicide.</p>

    in her cross-examination.  One of those
    alleged statements was potentially very damaging.  The trial judge refused a mistrial, but
    immediately told the jury that the statement by Ms. Ogle constituted “inadmissible
    conjecture or speculation”.  I do not
    understand counsel to challenge the trial judge’s refusal of a mistrial.</p>

    Crown’s right to cross-examine her on a prior inconsistent statement not
    reduced to writing must be found in s. 9(1) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>:  see
    Alan W. Bryant, “The Adversary’s Witness:  Cross-Examination and Proof of Prior Inconsistent Statements” (1984) 62
    Can. Bar Rev. 43, at p. 55.  In my view,
    after the trial judge made a declaration that the witness was <span
class=GramE>hostile,</span> Ms. Williams’ testimony was subject to the rules
    governing cross-examination.  Section 11
    is one of those rules.  In any event, I
    see no substantive difference in the operation of the two sections as they
    relate to calling evidence to prove a prior inconsistent statement.  While the language of the two sections is not
    identical, both sections are subject to an overriding judicial discretion that
    probably renders any differences in the language irrelevant to their
    application in practice.</p>

    statutorily mandated request for those recommendations.  One recommended 25 years, one recommended 20,
    one recommended 15 and the other recommended 11.  None of the four drew any distinction between
    the two appellants. </p>
