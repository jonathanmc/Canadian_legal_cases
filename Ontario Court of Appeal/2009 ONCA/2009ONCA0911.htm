  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>We
    have considered the “fresh” evidence of Dr. Gojer.  The Crown has very fairly invited the court
    to consider all of the issues raised by the appellant based on Dr. Gojer’s
    evidence on their merits without regard to the significant procedural hurdles that
    could have been raised by the Crown.  There are three areas potentially affected by Dr. Gojer’s evidence.</p>
  <h2>1. Was the appellant unfit to stand trial?  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Gojer acknowledges in his report that the
    appellant is fit under the test enunciated in <i>R. v. Taylor</i> (1992) 77 C.C.C. (3d) 551 (Ont. C.A.).  Dr. Gojer has concerns about the limited
    inquiry mandated by <i>Taylor</i>.  No doubt, from a psychiatric perspective,
    there are those who would prefer a broader approach to the fitness inquiry than
    is contemplated by <i>Taylor</i>.  Fitness is, however, a legal question and not
    a medical question.  The definition of
    “unfit to stand trial” in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> tracks the language in <i>Taylor</i>.  There is no basis in the opinion of Dr. Gojer
    to question the appellant’s fitness under the test enunciated in <i>Taylor</i> and the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <h2>2. Was the appellant NCRMD?  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant clearly suffers from a serious
    mental illness. His conduct at the relevant time was driven at least in part by
    his delusions, particularly those concerning his brother and the entitlement to
    the house that had formerly belonged to their parents.  The question is not, however, whether the
    appellant was mentally ill or acted out of delusions, but whether he was NCRMD
    within the meaning of s. 16 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Gojer agreed that the appellant was capable
    of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts.  He also agreed that the appellant knew his
    acts were legally wrong.  Dr. Gojer
    testified that the appellant should be found NCRMD because he was incapable of
    knowing his actions were morally wrong.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicable test where the NCR claim is
    founded on the assertion of an incapacity to know that one’s acts are morally
    wrong is set out in <i>R. v. Oommen</i> [1994]
    2 S.C.R. 507.  That case instructs that
    the court must determine whether the appellant was <i>incapable</i> of understanding that his acts were wrong according to
    the ordinary moral standards of reasonable members of the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, Dr. Gojer does not address this
    specific question in his report or in his evidence beyond stating that he does
    not think that the appellant knew that what he was doing was morally
    wrong.  The appellant’s personal belief
    about the morality of his actions is a different issue than his capacity to
    know how others in the community would assess the morality of his acts.  It is difficult to see how an individual like
    the appellant who knew his actions were legally wrong would be incapable of
    understanding that the same acts would be regarded as morally wrong by the community.  Dr. Gojer provides no insight into this problem.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also agree with the Crown’s contention that
    apart from Dr. Gojer’s fresh evidence, the psychiatric evidence accumulated
    over the years is against any NCRMD finding.  It must also be said that Dr. Gojer’s opinion was somewhat uninformed in
    that for some reason he did not see fit to re-interview the appellant before
    providing this opinion.  Dr. Gojer last
    saw the appellant over 6 years ago.  Also, for some reason, Dr. Gojer did not see fit to read the appellant’s
    evidence at trial before giving this opinion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has never suggested to any
    psychiatrist or in his evidence at trial that he did what he did because he
    believed he was justified in doing what he did.  His position throughout has been that he did not do the acts alleged
    against him.  As far as can be discerned
    from this record, he maintains that position today.  That claim is inconsistent with Dr. Gojer’s
    opinion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Gojer’s opinion comes down to a conclusory
    statement that appears to be driven in large measure by his belief that the
    appellant would be better served from a treatment perspective in the NCRMD
    regime than he would be in the penitentiary.  We cannot accept this result-driven approach to the NCRMD inquiry.  Dr. Gojer’s evidence does not provide any
    basis upon which the appellant could demonstrate that he was NCRMD at the
    relevant time.  </p>
  <h2>3.  <span class=GramE>Was</span> the
    appellant a long-term offender?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge considered whether the appellant
    could be managed in the community under a LTO order, although the trial judge
    did not have the benefit of the decision in <i>R.
    v. Johnson</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357.  The
    trial judge concluded that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant could not be managed in the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the initial hearing of this appeal in May 2008,
    the court concluded that there was no basis upon which to interfere with that
    finding.  We are now asked to consider
    whether a long-term offender order finding would be appropriate having regard
    to Dr. Gojer’s evidence.  We do not think
    there is anything in Dr. Gojer’s evidence that alters the situation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Gojer’s hypothesis is that the appellant
    could be placed on a drug regime and could be required to take that drug while at
    large as a long-term offender.  Dr. Gojer
    then hypothesizes that when the long-term offender period was concluded, the
    appellant could be controlled in the community by the availability of committal
    proceedings under the provincial mental health legislation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First of all, there is nothing to suggest that
    he appellant would comply with any order that he take medication while in the
    community.  The evidence is all in the
    other direction.  Second, there is no clear
    evidence as to what drug regime might be effectively used in the case of the
    appellant.  Finally, we do not think that
    the possibility of the appellant’s apprehension under provincial mental health
    legislation is a means of managing someone in the community.  To the contrary, it seems to suggest an
    inability to manage someone in the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no basis in the evidence of Dr. Gojer
    to substitute a long-term offender order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fresh evidence of Dr. Gojer could not have affected
    the result.  It is inadmissible under the
    fourth <i>Palmer</i> criteria.  The appeal is dismissed.  </p>
