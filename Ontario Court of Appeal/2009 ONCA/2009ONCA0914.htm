  <h4> <span
lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This appeal of a costs order raises a point of
    procedure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The plaintiffs, a group of optometrists, practise
    optometry in the town of Cornwall.  They
    sued Laurier Optical, a company that sells eyewear in Cornwall, as well as
    Laurier <span class=SpellE>Optical’s</span> principal and its solicitors, for
    defamation.  They claimed that two
    letters sent to them, each with a carbon copy notation to the College of
    Optometrists of Ontario and the College of Opticians of Ontario, were
    libellous.  The first letter, dated
    January 16, 2008, was sent by Laurier <span class=SpellE>Optical’s</span> solicitor; the second letter, dated March 3, 2008, was sent by Laurier
    Optical.  The plaintiffs alleged that both
    letters said that they had engaged in unprofessional and unethical conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The defendants brought a motion to strike the claim
    either under r. 21.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194 (the “<i>Rules</i>”) on the ground
    that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action, or under r. 21.01(3) on the
    ground that it was an abuse of process.  They contended that that the letters were not defamatory, and even if
    they were, they were privileged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   The plaintiffs
    then ascertained that the two letters, though containing a carbon copy notation
    to the College of Optometrists and the College of Opticians, were not sent to
    the Colleges at the time.  Thus, there
    had been no “publication”, an essential element of a cause of action in
    defamation.  The January 16, 2008 letter
    was sent, however, to the plaintiffs’ own College, the College of Optometrists,
    about three weeks later – on February 4, 2008 – as part of a formal complaint
    by Laurier Optical to the College.Having
    discovered that the letters were not sent to the Colleges when they thought
    they were, the plaintiffs brought a motion to dismiss their own action on the
    ground that it was moot.  And they sought
    costs of their motion against the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All motions were heard by <span class=SpellE>Ratushny</span> J.  She sensibly observed that, as both
    sides wanted to end the litigation, the only substantive issue before her was
    costs.  She decided that the defendants
    were entitled to their costs.  She gave
    two reasons: First, she concluded that the plaintiffs were really seeking to
    discontinue their action.  Accordingly,
    the defendants were presumptively entitled to their costs, and she saw no basis
    to displace that presumption.  Second,
    she concluded that the plaintiffs’ claim had no merit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The plaintiffs sought leave to appeal her costs order,
    and if leave was granted, to appeal the order.  </p>
  <h4> <span
lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On
    appeal, the plaintiffs made two submissions.  First, they submitted that the motions judge erred in treating their
    motion as a motion to discontinue their action, and therefore erred in
    concluding that the defendants were presumptively entitled to their costs.  Second, they argued that the January 16, 2008
    letter was defamatory, and that when they started their action they were
    reasonably entitled to assume the letter had been “published” to their own College.  The plaintiffs argued that they should be
    entitled to the costs of the motions, or alternatively that there should be no
    costs.  We did not call on the
    defendants.  We deliver these reasons
    principally to address the plaintiffs’ first submission, which raised the point
    of procedure referred to at the outset of these reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In
    making this submission, the plaintiffs relied on the judgment of Lane J. in <i>1286110 Ontario Ltd. v. College Manning
    Professional Centre Inc.</i> (2005), O.R. (3d) 463 (Div. Ct.).  In that case, as well, the plaintiff brought
    a motion to dismiss its own action and sought an order for costs against the
    defendants.  The defendants brought a
    cross-motion for an order for discontinuance of the plaintiff’s action and
    costs.  The master dismissed the
    plaintiff’s motion and allowed the defendants’ cross-motion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>However,
    Lane J. set aside the master’s decision and ordered that the action be
    dismissed without costs.  In his view,
    the master erred because in granting the cross-motion the master had effectively
    required the plaintiff to discontinue.  Discontinuance is a voluntary act; a plaintiff cannot be compelled to
    discontinue its own action.  Implicitly –
    and this is the key point I wish to address – Lane J. suggested that a
    plaintiff could move to dismiss its own action.  For the reasons that follow, I do not agree with that suggestion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Rule
    23.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> provides for discontinuance by a plaintiff: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P4054_193731"></a><a name=s23p01s1></a><span
lang=EN>23.01</span><span
lang=EN>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;A plaintiff may discontinue
    all or part of an action against any defendant, </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>(a)
    before the close of pleadings, by serving on all parties who have been served
    with the statement of claim a notice of discontinuance … and filing the notice
    with proof of service; </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>(b) <span
class=GramE>after</span> the close of pleadings, with leave of the court; or </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>(c) <span
class=GramE>at</span> any time, by filing the consent of all parties. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN>The
    motions judge agreed with Lane J., correctly in my view, that under r. 23.01
    “another party cannot compel a plaintiff to discontinue.  Discontinuance is a plaintiff’s option”.  However, the motions judge characterized the
    plaintiffs’ motion as a motion to discontinue, not a motion to dismiss, thus
    disagreeing with Lane J.’s approach in the <i>College
    Manning</i> case.  I think that she was
    right to do so.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN>The <i>Rules</i> expressly provide that a plaintiff
    can bring an end to its own litigation by moving to discontinue under r.
    23.01.  If a plaintiff chooses to do so,
    it faces the presumptive costs consequences of r. 23.05(a): </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P4074_196868"></a><a name=s23p05></a><span
lang=EN>23.05</span><span
lang=EN>&nbsp;Where a plaintiff discontinues an
    action against a defendant, </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>(a) <span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><span lang=EN>unless</span></span><span lang=EN> the court
    orders otherwise. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN>The <i>Rules</i> do not provide that a plaintiff
    can bring a motion to dismiss its own action.  Under the <i>Rules</i> – for example
    r. 21 – a motion to dismiss is brought by an opposite party in the
    litigation.  Although the <i>Rules</i> may not constitute a complete code
    of procedure, it seems to me where they have expressly set out a method of
    proceeding it is not open to a party to ignore that method and choose another
    one not authorized by the <i>Rules</i>.  Here, in moving to dismiss their own action,
    the plaintiffs are seeking to do an end run around the costs consequences of r.
    23.05.  The motions judge correctly
    refused to permit them to do so. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN>Although
    the plaintiffs could not be compelled to discontinue their own action, they
    acknowledged that because of the “non-publication” of the letters, they had no
    grounds to continue their action.  Therefore, as the motion judge rightly concluded, in essence they were
    seeking <span class=GramE>a discontinuance</span>.  And I see no error in her finding that the
    plaintiffs failed to show any basis for rebutting the presumption in r. 23.05,
    entitling the defendants to their costs. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN>On
    the plaintiffs’ second submission concerning the merits of their action, the
    March 3, 2008 letter is a non-issue.  The
    motions judge held that it was not defamatory.  In oral argument, the plaintiffs did not suggest otherwise.  Thus, the plaintiffs’ argument </span>centred<span
lang=EN> on the January 16, 2008 letter from
    Laurier <span class=SpellE>Optical’s</span> solicitors.  They claimed that the letter was defamatory,
    that it was reasonable to assume it had been sent to their College, and
    therefore, that they were justified in starting the action.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang=EN>I do
    not think it is necessary to decide whether, before starting their action, the
    plaintiffs should have ascertained that the January 16, 2008 letter was not yet
    “published”.  Even if they cannot be held
    accountable for failing to do so, the plaintiffs conceded that when the January
    16, 2008 letter was sent to the College of Optometrists on February 4, 2008, as
    part of Laurier <span class=SpellE>Optical’s</span> formal complaint, it was
    protected by absolute privilege.  Therefore, even if the January 16, 2008 letter had been sent to the College
    at the time, the plaintiffs would have had no claim to compensation because
    less than three weeks later the College received the letter under an umbrella
    of privilege.  Accordingly, I agree with
    the motions judge that the plaintiffs’ claim had no merit.  </span></p>
