  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As fall 2004 prepared to cede its place to winter, Erhun
    and Aysegul Candir were living together in their bungalow in a small town
    northwest of Toronto.  The couple, who
    had no children, had been married for 18 years.  Erhun was retired.  Aysegul worked
    as an ESL teacher at Bramalea Secondary School.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For several years, Aysegul had been unhappy in and
    wanted to leave her marriage.  She
    considered Erhun abusive.  She was also
    fed up with Erhun’s habit of collecting things and leaving them scattered indiscriminately
    all over the house.  Despite endless
    pledges of immediate purge, Erhun’s promises remained unfulfilled, the
    collection undivided.  Embarrassed by the
    clutter, Aysegul felt unable to invite any friends for a visit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On December 2, 2004, Aysegul took advantage of her
    husband’s planned visit to Turkey to leave her home and abandon her
    marriage.  She moved into an apartment of
    her own in a building with several security features. She took a number of
    further precautions to ensure that Erhun could not find her or take any
    reprisals against her for deserting him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On December 6, 2004, Erhun Candir returned from Turkey.  He found a note that Aysegul had left for him
    indicating that and why she had left their marriage.  The note contained no information about Aysegul’s
    whereabouts or how she could be contacted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Around noon on December 10, 2004, a lone gunman shot
    Aysegul to death as she sat in the driver’s seat of her car in the parking lot
    in Bramalea Secondary School.  The gunman
    fled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Within hours of the shooting, police arrested Erhun
    Candir.  After his wife died, Candir was
    charged with first degree murder, the offence of which a jury later convicted
    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Erhun Candir (the appellant) seeks a new trial on the
    basis of errors that he alleges the trial judge made in evidentiary and
    procedural rulings and in instructions to the jury.  I would not give effect to any of these
    claims of error and, for the reasons that follow, would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    prosecution’s case against the appellant was largely circumstantial.  Among its components were these:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>eyewitness
    testimony from several persons who saw a man at or leaving the scene of the
    shooting at Bramalea Secondary School;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>evidence
    of the opportunity of the appellant to commit the offence because of his
    contemporaneous presence at or proximity to the scene of the shooting;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>evidence
    of the appellant’s motive to kill the deceased;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>evidence
    of the appellant’s stalking or surveillance of the deceased;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>forensic
    evidence, including evidence of gunshot residue found on the appellant’s gloves
    and the steering wheel of the vehicle he had rented on the day before the day
    of the shooting; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>vi.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>the
    appellant’s admissions made upon arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant did not testify.  He called no
    witnesses.  The defence advanced at trial
    was a denial of liability, coupled with a submission that the police
    investigation that led to his arrest was deeply flawed, the product of tunnel
    vision and a failure to pursue other legitimate suspects, including perhaps
    disgruntled or disaffected students.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Evidence of Motive </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    prove that it was the appellant who unlawfully killed his wife and that the
    unlawful killing was a planned and deliberate murder, the prosecutor introduced
    evidence to support a finding that the appellant bore an <i>animus</i> towards the deceased because she had left him, thus had a
    motive to kill her in circumstances that amounted to first degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    large measure, the means invoked by the prosecutor to establish the appellant’s
    motive involved the introduction of a substantial number of remarks attributed
    to the deceased by several friends, close neighbours and colleagues at work, as
    well as her doctor, in the months preceding her death about her unhappiness in
    and desire to leave her marriage because of the appellant’s possessive and
    controlling nature.  Evidence of the
    deceased’s mental state, as revealed by her remarks, was offered to make it
    more probable that her relationship with the appellant was unsatisfactory to
    her, and that her leaving reflected a determination to put a permanent end to
    their relationship.  In turn, these facts
    were said to make it more probable that the appellant bore the deceased an <i>animus</i>, thus had the motive alleged to
    kill her.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    essence, the evidence of the recipients of the deceased’s contemporaneous <i>ante mortem </i>remarks revealed that she
    was afraid of the appellant, especially of what she expected would be his
    reaction to her abandonment of the marriage, and was firmly convinced that he
    would not permit her to leave.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Evidence
    was also adduced about the appellant’s reaction when he discovered the deceased
    had left him.  In a discussion with a
    friend the evening before the deceased was shot and in an email to the deceased
    the day she died, the appellant claimed that he had nothing to live for and had
    made changes to his will.  He complained
    that the deceased had taken some property from the house and cautioned his
    friend, Ms. Schiller, not to call the deceased.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Stalking Evidence: December 7-9, 2004</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Evidence
    was introduced upon which the jury could conclude that the appellant was
    watching for, perhaps stalking, the deceased at the one place he knew she would
    be: Bramalea Secondary School.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant returned home from Turkey on December 6, 2004.  The following afternoon, a van resembling the
    appellant’s 1996 Safari LSX Minivan appeared in the parking lot of Bramalea
    Secondary School.  Moments later, an
    agitated man identified as the appellant sought to gain entry to an area of the
    school to which an access card was required.  A student, assisting in the supervision of a student sports activity,
    refused the appellant entry.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    December 8, 2004, a vehicle resembling the appellant’s Safari minivan entered
    the parking lot of Bramalea Secondary School at about the same time as the
    appellant’s van had entered the lot on the previous day.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Evidence
    of Opportunity and Proximity</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    about 9:00 a.m. on December 9, 2004, the day before the shooting, the appellant
    rented a 2005 extended model Pontiac Montana SV6 from a car rental office in
    the town where he lived.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant returned several items to a Staples outlet in Bolton around 10:00
    a.m. on December 10, 2004, and left the store around 10:17 a.m.  The store is about a 5 minute drive from
    Bramalea Secondary School.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    surveillance cameras at Bramalea Secondary School showed a silver Montana minivan
    similar to the one the appellant had rented the previous day enter the school
    parking lot at 10:23 a.m. and leave six minutes later, immediately behind a
    vehicle similar to the deceased’s Honda.  The silver minivan returned at 10:46 a.m., the vehicle similar to the
    deceased’s Honda at 11:05 a.m.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
    to the time on the school surveillance video, the Montana left the lot at an
    increased rate of speed at ll:08 a.m., six minutes before the first emergency
    vehicle, a police cruiser, arrived after the shooting of the deceased had been
    reported.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Forensic Evidence: Gunshot
    Residue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    van rented by the appellant on December 9, 2004, was a new model with
    distinctive characteristics.  The van had
    only recently arrived from the manufacturer through a local dealership and had
    never been rented before the appellant’s rental of it on December 9.  He returned the van slightly more than an
    hour after his wife had been shot.  Police seized the vehicle before it was rented again.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    chemist from the Centre of Forensic Sciences examined the steering wheel and
    driver’s door handle of the van, as well as the clothing worn and gloves
    carried by the appellant at the time of his arrest.  The chemist found nine particles of gunshot
    residue on the steering wheel of the van, but none on the door handle.  He found 13 particles of gunshot residue on
    the gloves carried by the appellant when arrested and other particles on his
    clothing and right hand.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Gunshot
    residue can be deposited on a surface because a person has fired or been in
    close proximity to someone who has fired a gun, or by transfer from some other
    items or person to which or to whom the residue is adherent.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    deceased was killed by shots fired from a .32 calibre semi-automatic
    handgun.  The weapon used was not
    recovered.  Police found ammunition
    hidden in the appellant’s home that could be fired in a .32 calibre handgun.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Appellant’s Admissions on Arrest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant was arrested at his home shortly before 2:00 p.m. on December 10,
    2004.  He was told he was being arrested
    for an attempted murder in Brampton. After caution and <i>Charter</i> advice, the appellant told the police that when he had
    called his wife from Europe and received no answer, he knew something was wrong
    so he flew home.  He said he had been
    depressed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant admitted that he had been in Brampton at a Staples store that day and
    referred to a receipt he had obtained.  He may have gone to his wife’s school, but couldn’t remember.  He referred to his wife in the past tense:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>She
    was everything to me.  She was all I
    had.  I loved my wife.  She shouldn’t have left me.  I wouldn’t have done that to her.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US> In answer to a police query, the appellant
    explained that while he would never have robbed his wife: “she used me and
    robbed me on top of that”.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant advances several grounds of appeal.  Some assert error in admitting <i>ante
    mortem</i> statements of the deceased and in instructing the jury on the use it
    could make of hearsay, eyewitness identification and expert evidence.  Others contend that the trial judge erred in
    restricting the scope of cross-examination and enlarging the range of
    re-examination of some witnesses who gave evidence for the prosecution. The
    final complaint faults the trial judge for his decision not to remedy an
    allegation of failed or late disclosure advanced by the appellant’s trial
    counsel.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The First Ground: Admissibility of and

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the appellant’s trial two principal issues emerged:</span></p>

    identity of the deceased’s killer; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.      the

lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    trial, the prosecutor proposed to introduce through 16 recipients about 150
    statements attributed to the deceased by the recipients in the months, weeks
    and days before her death on December 10, 2004.  The statements were tendered as narrative, as statements disclosing the
    deceased’s state of mind, and as statements that satisfied the requirements of
    necessity and reliability under the principled approach to hearsay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial
    counsel for the appellant conceded that many of the deceased’s contemporaneous <i>ante mortem </i>statements were properly

    the appellant, Mr. Doucette contends that the trial judge erred in his overall
    approach to the admissibility of the deceased’s contemporaneous <i>ante mortem</i> statements. The error, Mr.
    Doucette says, was the trial judge’s failure to consider the materiality of the
    statements proposed for admission in light of the appellant’s acknowledgement
    of the basic facts underlying these statements.  The deceased was unhappy in her marriage.  She wanted to leave her marriage and planned
    to do so.  She executed her plan.  Her move was permanent.  With these acknowledgements, evidence of the
    deceased’s statements indicating her intention to do what she did was at once
    irrelevant and immaterial.</span></p>

    probative value of this evidence was slight, clearly overshadowed by its
    prejudicial effect in painting the appellant as an insensitive and abusive

    control the court’s process and prohibit the needless presentation of

    remarks about two specific incidents that portrayed the appellant in a bad
    light.  One involved a quarrel about the
    setting on a household thermostat, the other a squabble about an energy supply

    the respondent Ms. Ficek takes a contrary position.  To begin, the hearsay statements of the deceased
    were neither irrelevant, nor immaterial.  The concessions of trial counsel, which were not formal admissions, did
    not render the evidence of the deceased’s statements irrelevant.  These statements were probative of the
    deceased’s state of mind.  They revealed
    that the marital relationship was unsatisfactory to her, that she determined to
    end it and to end it on a permanent basis.  These inferences enhanced the likelihood that the appellant had the
    motive ascribed to him by the prosecutor.  Evidence of motive is of importance on the two contested issues at
    trial: identity and the legal character of the unlawful killing.</span></p>

    Ficek says that the reception of this evidence is amply supported by
    authority.  It is routinely admitted in prosecutions
    of domestic homicide, despite its frequent inclusion of reference to extrinsic
    misconduct by the surviving and accused partner.  The trial judge balanced probative value and
    prejudicial effect.  His assessment of
    where the balance fell is entitled to substantial deference.  The mere fact that some evidence was
    admitted, but other evidence about the same subject excluded is reflective of
    the nature of the balancing exercise, not of any error in its application.</span></p>

    than it would be otherwise: see <i>R. v.
    Cloutier</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, at pp. 730-32.  The exclusivity or cogency of the inferences
    that may be drawn from the item of evidence have no place in the inquiry into

    prove is in issue according to the governing substantive and procedural law and

    shortcomings associated with the hearsay evidence and invite the jurors to
    examine the rest of the evidence when considering the reliability of the
    admissible hearsay: <i>R. v. A.(S.)</i> (1992), 11O.R. (3d) 16 (C.A.), at pp. 22-23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes, admissible hearsay that describes the
    relationship between principals in a prosecution for domestic homicide recounts
    incidents of extrinsic misconduct by the person accused of the unlawful
    killing. These statements are often proffered, as here, to establish <i>animus</i> between the principals, thus a
    motive to kill.  Where the statements are
    offered to prove motive, thereby to establish identity and the state of mind
    that accompanied the unlawful killing, the usual limiting instruction about
    evidence of extrinsic misconduct has no place:  <i>Jackson</i> at pp. 168-69; <i>R. v. Pasqualino</i> (2008), 233 C.C.C. (3d)
    319 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 65.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied: Admissibility</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appellant says that the trial judge wrongly failed
    to exclude the deceased’s <i>ante mortem</i> statements as immaterial and more prejudicial than probative, and further
    failed to apply the governing principles consistently to the entire body of <i>ante mortem</i> statements.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Evidence is properly regarded as immaterial if the
    proposition of fact the evidence is offered to prove is not an issue before the
    trier of fact under the prevailing substantive and procedural law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this case, evidence of the deceased’s <i>ante mortem</i> statements was offered to
    prove the deceased’s state of mind about her relationship with the appellant,
    thus enhancing the probability that the relationship with the appellant was
    unsatisfactory to her, that she determined to end it, and that she did end it
    on a basis that to her was permanent.  These facts make it more probable that the appellant had a motive to
    kill her than would be the case without the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Evidence that a person had a motive to do an act, for
    example to unlawfully kill another, is relevant to prove that the person with
    the motive did the act, and did so intentionally.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At trial, the appellant denied any involvement in the
    deceased’s death.  He was not  her killer.  Somebody else killed her.  He did
    not commit murder.  Said in another way,
    the appellant, as he was entitled to do, put Crown counsel to strict proof of
    his participation in the unlawful killing and of the legal character of the
    crime committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Any evidence that showed or tended to show, directly or
    by inference, that the appellant had a motive to kill the deceased was relevant
    to prove that the appellant in fact had such a motive.  Since evidence of motive is circumstantial
    evidence that may help to establish not only the identity of the person who
    committed an offence, but also the state of mind with which the offence was
    committed, evidence of motive was material.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether a formal admission under s. 655 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> would have the effect of
    rendering immaterial evidence that tended to show the appellant had a motive to
    kill, thus killed the deceased (a matter about which I have grave doubts since
    the state of mind issue would remain at large), the informal acknowledgement of
    “basic facts” made here can have no such effect.  Taken at its highest, the informal admission
    was a factor for the trial judge to consider in determining whether to exclude
    the hearsay evidence on the ground that its prejudicial effect exceeded the
    probative value: <i>Foreman</i> at para. 29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge did not err in failing to exclude the
    deceased’s <i>ante mortem</i> statements as
    immaterial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second point the appellant makes on the
    admissibility issue faults the trial judge for failing to exercise his general
    exclusionary discretion to reject the <i>ante
    mortem</i> statements as more prejudicial than probative or needlessly
    cumulative.  I would not give effect to
    this ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether introduced through the testimony of recipients
    of hearsay statements made by a deceased declarant before death or from some
    other sources, evidence exposing the nature of the relationship between the
    principals in a prosecution for domestic homicide often discloses incidents or
    a pattern of extrinsic misconduct by the surviving partner, the accused.  The capacity of this evidence to generate
    both moral and reasoning prejudice is well recognized.  And so it is that the trial judge has a
    discretion to exclude the evidence where its prejudicial effect exceeds its
    probative value.  That said, where the
    evidence is admitted and relied upon to establish motive, it may not be
    necessary for the trial judge to give the usual warning against propensity
    reasoning in final instructions: <i>Jackson </i>at
    pp. 168-69.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This case does <i>not</i> involve evidence of prior physical abuse of the deceased by the appellant, a
    feature that was emphasized by the appellant’s trial counsel in his closing
    address.  Without minimizing the inherent
    potential of emotional abuse to generate moral prejudice, the risk of misuse
    seems of a different magnitude and lesser likelihood than where the evidence
    reveals a prolonged pattern of physical abuse and threats.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge clearly recognized that he had a
    discretion to exclude any hearsay statement on the ground that its probative
    value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  He excluded some statements on this ground.  He admitted others where, in his view,
    probative value prevailed.  Balancing
    probative value and prejudicial effect of various items of evidence is notoriously
    a fact-sensitive and case-specific exercise. The trial judge’s conclusions
    informed by correct legal principles, are entitled to deference.  That some conclusions appear on their face inconsistent
    with others seems the quintessence of the process in which the trial judge was
    engaged.  At all events, differences in
    result for declarations about a common subject-matter tendered through
    different recipients is scarcely a badge of error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several witnesses gave evidence as recipients of
    various statements made by the deceased about her desire to leave her marriage
    and fears of reprisal if she followed through with her plan.  These expressions culminated in her
    abandonment of the marriage while the appellant was in Turkey.  It was of no little importance to the case for
    the Crown to show the pervasive nature of her dissatisfaction with the marital
    relationship and the firmness of her resolve to end it on a permanent
    basis.  That her state of mind persisted
    and was shared with several over many months went some way towards proof of
    what the Crown sought.  These facts, in
    their turn, made it more probable that the appellant had the motive assigned to
    him than would have been the case without the evidence of the deceased’s state
    of mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The hearsay statements of the deceased declarant were
    proffered and admitted as circumstantial evidence of the appellant’s motive to
    kill the deceased.  Evidence of motive
    was relevant to prove that it was the appellant who killed the deceased, and to
    establish his state of mind when he did so. Both identity and the legal
    character of the unlawful killing were contested issues at trial. Other
    evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that the deceased had abandoned the
    marriage.  She left the matrimonial home
    for a new premises that she had leased. She took various precautions to ensure
    that the appellant could not find her new residence. The value added by her
    hearsay statements was of the continuity of her state of mind, the deep-seated
    nature of her complaints and the firmness of her resolve to permanently end the
    marriage.  It is doubtful whether such
    evidence could be available from any other source.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The moral prejudice asserted with this evidence was not
    high.  It involved no complaint of any
    assaultive behaviour.  Boorish.  Cheap.  Messy.  The statements revealed
    little more about the nature of the appellant than the “Dear John” note left
    for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Apart from an argument that the hearsay statements were
    immaterial because there was no dispute about certain “basic facts”, trial
    counsel for the appellant does not appear to have asked the trial judge to exclude
    the statements on the ground that to admit them would amount to the needless
    presentation of cumulative evidence. Indeed, trial counsel consented to the
    admission of many statements and did not object to others because he thought
    their impact caused no prejudice to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the circumstances of this case, I am not prepared to
    say that the trial judge should have excluded the contested hearsay statements
    on the ground of needless presentation of cumulative evidence.  That the same purpose could have been
    achieved by the introduction of fewer statements does not mean that the number
    adduced called for the invocation of the exclusionary discretion.  The line between enough and too much is not
    always easy to fathom, even with hindsight.  But it was not crossed here.  </p>

    findings necessary before they could make any use of the statements.</span></p>

    which the case for the Crown depends substantially on the correctness of
    eyewitness identification evidence.  But
    this is not a prosecution in which the appellant’s liability falls to be

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=FR-CA>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Where the prosecution’s case depends
    substantially on the accuracy of eyewitness identification evidence, a trial
    judge must instruct the jury about the need for them to be cautious in dealing
    with eyewitness testimony.  The charge
    must deal with issues of credibility but also elucidate the inherent frailties
    of eyewitness identification due to the unreliability of human observation and
    recollection.  The trial judge should
    explain to the jury the myriad factors that can affect the reliability of eyewitness
    identification testimony given by perfectly honest witnesses and remind jurors
    that mistaken identification has been responsible for miscarriages of justice
    because persons who have been mistakenly identified by one or more honest
    witnesses have been wrongly convicted:  <i>R. v. Wristen</i> (1999), 47 O.R. (3d) 66
    (C.A.), at para. </span><span lang=FR-CA>32; <i>R. v. Thompson</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d)
    128 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 57.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes a general warning about the risks of error
    inherent in eyewitness identification testimony will be sufficient to caution
    jurors about reliance upon it.  In other
    instances, more detailed and specific instructions will be required because of
    specific frailties that emerge as the witnesses are questioned at trial: <i>R. v. Baltovich</i> (2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 481
    (C.A.), at paras. 78-83.  Trial judges
    have considerable latitude in deciding how best to apprise the jurors about the
    frailties of eyewitness identification testimony: <i>Baltovich</i> at para. 78.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One form of identification that often attracts a
    specific instruction is in-court or in-dock identification. Eyewitness in-court
    identification of an accused as the person responsible for an offence often has
    a dramatic effect, frequently disproportionate to its value as probative of
    guilt.  A specific and fortified caution
    may be necessary to dispel the deceptive reliability of this evidence: <i>R. v. Hibbert</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at
    paras. 50-51.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where there are material discrepancies, said in another
    way, dissimilarities between the descriptions provided by an eyewitness and the
    appearance of the person later identified by the same witness as the
    perpetrator, a fortified caution, sometimes an instruction that the evidence is
    exculpatory, may be required, at least in the absence of other inculpatory

lang=FR-CA>The
    Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This ground of appeal is advanced in connection with
    the testimony of the witness who gave evidence about an event that occurred
    three days before the deceased was shot and of two witnesses who reported
    seeing a man in the parking lot at Bramalea Secondary School contemporaneously
    with shooting.  None claimed to be 100%
    certain about the identity of this person.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge instructed the jury in terms to which
    no exception has been or could be taken about the inherent frailties of
    eyewitness identification evidence.  The
    jurors were told to be very cautious about acting on eyewitness identification
    evidence because of its causal link to previous miscarriages of justice.  The trial judge reminded jurors that honest
    witnesses can make mistakes and that the confidence with which a witness
    expresses him or herself should not be equated with or taken as reflecting the
    reliability of their evidence.  The trial
    judge listed several questions for jurors to consider when they examined the
    circumstances under which the jurors made their observations and their identifications
    in the photographic lineup.  The trial
    judge also invited the jurors to consider the various descriptions provided by
    the witnesses of the person they saw, including variations and inconsistencies
    in those descriptions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At the end of his general instructions about the
    inherent frailties of eyewitness identification evidence, the trial judge
    reviewed the specifics of the testimony of the three witnesses – Farley, Terzi
    and Gatch.  He pointed out their earlier
    descriptions, including the discrepancies between their earlier descriptions,
    later descriptions and trial testimony, as well as the differences between
    those descriptions and the appellant’s physical appearance.  He also reviewed the photo lineup procedure,
    not only in relation to each witness, but also in connection with the officer
    who conducted the lineup.  Among the
    features highlighted was the failure to follow the appropriate protocol for the
    display of photos to eyewitnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Adherence to and application of a functional test in
    assessing the adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions on the eyewitness
    testimony compels the conclusion that what was said was adequate to apprise the
    jury about this evidence in the circumstances of this case.  This was a circumstantial case, not a case that
    was substantially dependent on the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed to
    have seen the shooting.  Motive.  Opportunity.  A forensic link.  A telling
    admission.  A formidable combination, when
    left unexplained.</p>

    Cross-Examination</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US><b>The Background</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A position advanced by defence counsel at trial was
    that an unknown assailant, likely a person of East Indian origin in his 20s,
    had killed the deceased.  In 911 calls
    reporting the shooting, Riccardo Terzi, Milton Murray and Cynthia Gatch
    described the person they saw near or running from the scene of the shooting as
    East Indian.  Despite this information,
    police did nothing to follow up in their investigation, rather focused exclusively
    on the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At trial, defence counsel sought to develop his
    position that an unknown East Indian student may have killed the deceased
    through cross-examination of various prosecution witnesses. He cross-examined a
    vice-principal and another ESL teacher at Bramalea Secondary School about
    incidents of student on teacher violence at the school. The prosecutor did not
    object to this line of questioning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Defence counsel asked another teacher, who had worked
    with the deceased at an elementary school, about her knowledge of any incidents
    between the deceased and students at the other school.  When the witness indicated that she was aware
    of these incidents, counsel asked the witness to describe the incidents.  The incidents, which occurred in 2003, had
    been described in disclosure the prosecutor had provided to defence
    counsel.  Included in the disclosure were
    the names of the students involved in the incidents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The prosecutor objected to the cross-examination on the
    ground that the evidence sought was irrelevant and inadmissible hearsay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Defence counsel reiterated his position that he was not
    advancing a third party suspect defence because he could not identify any
    specific third party suspect.  He wanted
    to demonstrate “that the deceased’s character was such that she would
    intervene”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge considered the question to be inappropriate
    and did not permit the witness to answer.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Doucette did not press this complaint in oral
    argument. He readily acknowledged that, on its own, the trial judge’s ruling,
    even if in error, would not warrant appellate intervention, much less an order
    for a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In his factum, Mr. Doucette contended that the trial
    judge wrongly applied the legal principles that govern claims that a (specific)
    third party committed the offence to what the appellant’s trial counsel sought
    to do here.  The basis advanced for the
    proposed cross-examination was rooted in contemporaneous descriptions of the
    person fleeing the parking lot as an East Indian in his 20s.  The evidence to be elicited would raise a
    doubt, according to counsel at trial, about the identity of the assailant, and
    rebut any suggestion that the deceased was universally loved by her students.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In his factum, the respondent contended that the ruling
    barred only a specific line of cross-examination that would have elicited
    irrelevant evidence and inadmissible hearsay. Defence counsel had already
    adduced evidence from teachers at Bramalea Secondary School about student-teacher
    violence and had cross-examined several witnesses about tunnel vision, in
    particular the failure to investigate the prospect that an East Indian male in
    his 20s had killed the deceased.  The
    descriptions, which did not fit the appellant, were already before the jury.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is fundamental that any person charged with a murder
    of another may introduce evidence at his or her trial that it was someone else,
    a third party, who killed the deceased.  The evidence adduced in support of what has become known as a “third
    party suspect” defence, may be either or both direct and circumstantial
    evidence: <i>Wigmore on Evidence </i>(Tillers
    Rev. 1983), vol. 1A, s. 139 at pp. 1723-24; <i>R.
    v. McMillan</i> (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 750 (C.A.), at p. 757; <i>R. v. Grandinetti</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27, at paras. 46-48.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Evidence that the offence charged was committed by a
    third party, rather than by the accused, must be relevant and satisfy any
    applicable rule of admissibility.  To
    ensure that any evidence proffered for admission on this issue has sufficient
    probative value to justify its reception, we require evidence that the third
    party is sufficiently connected by other circumstances to the crime charged to
    give the proposed evidence some probative value: <i>Wigmore on Evidence </i>(Tillers Rev. 1983), vol. 1A, s. 139 at p. 1724; <i>McMillan </i>at p. 757; <i>Grandinetti</i> at paras. 46-48.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is also open to an accused to attack the integrity
    or adequacy of the police investigation that has culminated in charges for
    which the accused is on trial: <i>R. v.
    Dhillon </i>(2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 45; <i>R. v. Lane</i> (2008), 94 O.R. (3d) 177 (C.A.),
    at para. 40; <i>R. v. Mallory </i>(2007),
    217 C.C.C. (3d) 266 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 87.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ruling that has spawned this ground of appeal
    responded to an objection made by the prosecutor to defence counsel’s
    cross-examination of a former colleague of the deceased.  Counsel invited the witness to describe for
    the jury incidents between the deceased and students at a school at which the
    deceased had previously been a teacher.  The trial judge ruled that the witness would not be permitted to answer
    the question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge’s ruling on the propriety of the
    question asked by the appellant’s trial counsel was correct.  The witness did not observe the incidents
    about which she was asked.  The names of
    the students involved had been disclosed to the cross-examiner.  It was never suggested that either student
    was enrolled at Bramalea Secondary School, or was otherwise present when the
    deceased was killed.  Although defence
    counsel denied any third party suspect claim, he acknowledged “trying to create
    the scenario which would explain who that other person was”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The open-ended question posed by the cross-examiner
    invited a response that was, at best, inadmissible hearsay.  The witness did not see either incident.  Her knowledge of the incidents was gained
    from reports by another or others.  The
    purpose of the evidence was to prove that the altercations had taken place, in
    other words, to establish their truth.  That the answer of the witness would have been inadmissible hearsay is
    sufficient to sustain the trial judge’s ruling.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would also have been open to the trial judge to
    exclude the witness’ answer on other grounds.  Given trial counsel’s disavowal of any third party suspect claim,
    evidence that two former students had an altercation with the deceased at
    another school a year before the deceased was shot to death would seem neither
    relevant nor material.  Nor would the
    response service a claim that the police investigation was inadequate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Fourth Ground: The Re-examination of
    Detective Sergeant Magnus</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US><b>The Background</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Det. Sgt. Brent Magnus was one of the investigating
    officers.  His examination-in-chief was
    largely completed in one day, but concluded on another about two weeks
    later.  In the interim, defence counsel indicated
    that he proposed to cross-examine the officer on the scope of his investigation
    between the time of the shooting and the appellant’s arrest later the same day.
    The prosecutor concluded his examination-in-chief of Det. Sgt. Magnus by
    eliciting evidence from the officer that the photo lineups shown to various
    witnesses contained the photograph of only one suspect: the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contrary to his original announced intention, defence counsel
    did not cross-examine Det. Sgt. Magnus on the scope of the police investigation
    in the hour between the shooting and the arrest of the appellant.  Instead, counsel focused on the adequacy and
    propriety of the procedure followed by the police in displaying photographs to
    the witnesses Terzi, Gatch and Farley.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In cross-examination, Det. Sgt. Magnus was asked
    whether investigators had ever thought of showing Ms. Gatch a photo lineup of
    12 male East Indians in their 20s.  The
    officer replied that, as far as he knew, the police did not develop any
    suspects that matched counsel’s description throughout the entire
    investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In re-examination, Det. Sgt. Magnus explained that from
    the time of the shooting until display of the photo lineups, the only suspect
    developed by the police was the appellant.  The re-examination concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.     And
    specifically relating to Mr. Moon’s question in cross-examination, did you have
    during that timeframe any other suspects of East Indian or younger East Indian
    individuals that you could have put in any photo lineup?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.     No,
    we did not.  We did not have any
    information except for some information that came to light immediately that a
    description may have been provided as a male East Indian.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. MOON [Defence Counsel]:I can’t hear the      witness.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT: Your last sentence dragged off, could you just repeat it please, Detective Sergeant Magnus.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE WITNESS: There was some
    information initially from calls and through the dispatcher that a male East
    Indian  description may have been
    provided, but initially it’s very chaotic when an incident such as this
    transpires, and once you start analyzing all the information coming in, you can
    get a – a complete picture as to what has transpired.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties on
    Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the appellant, Mr. Doucette reminds us that the
    adequacy of the police investigation was not challenged during
    cross-examination of Det. Sgt. Magnus.  The cross-examination concentrated on the specific flaws associated with
    the photographic lineup and their impact on the reliability of any
    identification made by the witnesses to whom the photos were shown. Yet the
    trial judge permitted the re-examination to exceed what was permissible, allowing
    Det. Sgt. Magnus to offer his opinion of the appellant’s guilt since the
    appellant was the only suspect developed during the investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Scrutton for the respondent contends that the trial
    judge was satisfied, as he was entitled to conclude from the conduct of the
    defence, that the adequacy of the police investigation was being challenged.  The responsive evidence was confined to the
    two-week period between the shooting and the last photo lineup displayed and
    was properly admitted in re-examination.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Applicable Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An accused may challenge the adequacy of the police
    investigation that has resulted in the charges on which he or she is being
    tried.  The evidence may be elicited by
    cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, the introduction of defence
    evidence, or by both means. Where the defence asserts an inadequate police
    investigation, however, the prosecutor is entitled to a fair opportunity to
    rebut the defence assertion: <i>Dhillon</i> at para. 46; <i>Lane</i> at para. 41. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The entitlement of the prosecutor to adduce rebuttal
    evidence may permit the introduction of investigative hearsay, subject to the
    general discretion to exclude evidence the probative value of which is
    overshadowed by its prejudicial effect: <i>Dhillon</i> at para. 46.  The responsive evidence may
    also include otherwise inadmissible evidence of the accused’s antecedents,
    provided the evidence is relevant to the adequacy of the investigation: <i>Dhillon</i> at para. 46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The perils associated with raising an “other suspects”
    or “inadequate investigation” issue have attracted comment in previous
    decisions of this court: <i>Mallory</i> at
    para. 87; <i>Lane</i> at para. 40.  Whether either issue has been raised in a
    case is for the trial judge to determine on the basis of all the circumstances,
    not simply the cross-examination of a single witness. Substance prevails, not
    form. Calling it something other than what it is in an attempt to avoid the
    threshold requirement or the introduction of rebuttal evidence, in other words,
    an end-around, is to no avail.  After all,
    a rose by any other name … .</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is fundamental that the permissible scope of
    re-examination is linked to its purpose and the subject-matter on which the
    witness has been cross-examined.  The
    purpose of re-examination is largely rehabilitative and explanatory. The
    witness is afforded the opportunity, under questioning by the examiner who
    called the witness in the first place, to explain, clarify or qualify answers
    given in cross-examination that are considered damaging to the examiner’s
    case.  The examiner has no right to
    introduce new subjects in re-examination, topics that should have been covered,
    if at all, in examination in-chief of the witness.  A trial judge has a discretion, however, to
    grant leave to the party calling a witness to introduce new subjects in
    re-examination, but must afford the opposing party the right of further cross-examination
    on the new facts: <i>R. v. Moore</i> (1984),
    15 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 568.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The defence position at trial was that the police investigation
    of this killing was inadequate, reflective of tunnel vision. The police focus
    fell immediately upon and never shifted from the appellant who was arrested
    within about 90 minutes of the shooting.  A particular complaint was the failure of investigators to follow up on
    the involvement of an East Indian male in his 20s, a description provided by
    911 callers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was open to defence counsel at trial to challenge
    the adequacy or thoroughness of the police investigation into the unlawful
    killing of the deceased. As part of that challenge, it was open to defence
    counsel to adduce evidence that tended to show that investigators did not
    pursue the potential involvement of any East Indian men in their 20s, despite
    eyewitness descriptions of such a person leaving the scene of the shooting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the defence could not have it both ways.  Their pursuit of a claim of inadequate
    investigation left it open to the prosecutor to adduce evidence rebutting the
    claim, in essence, demonstrating the thoroughness of the investigation and
    explaining why the particular “lead” was not pursued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The response permitted in re-examination of one of the
    lead investigators was measured and specific. It contained no reference to any
    extrinsic misconduct by the appellant and was limited to the steps taken in the
    period between the shooting and the last photo lineup.  It was open to the trial judge to make the
    ruling he did.  </p>

    11:14 a.m. was made within two minutes of the shooting, as the caller said, the
    appellant could not have been the deceased’s killer because he had left the
    schoolyard before the shooting occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>To advance this position, defence
    counsel sought to file as an exhibit a printout of the 911 calls received in
    connection with the shooting.  The first
    call was received at 11:14:28 a.m. according to the 911 system.  The van had left the school property at
    11:08:20 a.m. according to the school security system.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The prosecutor objected to tender of
    the 911 printout as an exhibit at trial. The witness through whom defence
    counsel proposed to introduce the exhibit was a videotape analyst called to
    give evidence about the vehicles depicted on the security video from Bramalea
    Secondary School. The witness had no knowledge about the accuracy of the time
    displayed on the school video or whether the two systems were synchronous.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>As part of the disclosure provided
    to the defence after the appellant had been charged with the murder of his
    wife, the prosecutor had furnished the “will state” of a police officer about a
    time check done on December 16, 2004, less than a week after the killing.  The officer called 911 and spoke to a civilian
    operator.  The officer announced to the
    operator the time displayed on the video system at the school and had the
    operator tell him the time displayed on the CAD system used for 911 calls. The
    times differed by about five and one-half minutes: the school system showed the
    earlier time.  The officer’s name was on
    the witness list provided to defence counsel before trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>After defence counsel had
    cross-examined the videotape analyst to establish the evidentiary basis for a
    submission that the appellant’s van had left the school property before, not
    immediately after, the shooting, the prosecutor asked investigators to
    determine whether an audio recording had been made of the time check of
    December 16, 2004, and was still available. The audio recording was located,
    delivered to the prosecutor, and disclosed to defence counsel at the end of the
    next day’s sittings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

lang=EN-US>Defence counsel sought a mistrial,
    among other things, on the ground of delayed disclosure.  The jury was excused for a full week while
    the motion was argued and considered.  The

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties on
    Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the appellant, Mr. Doucette
    contends that the position advanced at trial, that the appellant’s van had left
    the school prior to the shooting, was a viable one, despite the time comparison
    references contained in officers’ notes disclosed prior to trial. The prejudice
    to the appellant here resided in the prosecutor’s failure to disclose the audio
    recording immediately on receipt.  The
    audio recording was real evidence, incapable of dislodgement or qualification
    by cross-examination, unlike testimony from police witnesses, members of the
    same police force who had rushed to judgment in charging the appellant within
    90 minutes of the shooting.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Scrutton responds with a denial
    of any failure of timely disclosure. The information contained in the audio
    recording added nothing to the disclosure that had been provided well in
    advance of the appellant’s preliminary inquiry and trial.  The prosecutor’s initial objection to filing
    the 911 call log was based on the inability of the witness then being
    cross-examined to testify about the recording systems and the presence or
    absence of synchronicity between the two systems.  At all events, the audio recording was
    disclosed three weeks before the witness who conducted the time check
    testified.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>When an issue about delayed
    disclosure is raised at trial, the logical place to begin is with an inquiry
    into whether the subject-matter of the complaint fell within the scope of
    prosecutorial disclosure required by the authorities.  A negative response ends the inquiry.  An affirmative answer signals further
    examination.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The right to disclosure is a
    component of the right to make full answer and defence, itself a principle of
    fundamental justice.  Not every breach of
    the prosecutor’s disclosure obligation will impair an accused’s right to make
    full answer and defence: <i>R. v. Dixon</i>,
    [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 at para. 31.  And so
    it will fall to the trial judge to assay the impact of the failure to make
    timely disclosure on the accused’s right to make full answer and defence and to
    have a fair trial.  It equally falls to
    the trial judge to determine the appropriate remedy where an accused has demonstrated
    a <i>Charter</i> infringement due to late
    disclosure.  The remedy must be just and
    appropriate in all the circumstances.  In
    many cases, an adjournment will suffice: <i>Dixon </i>at para. 31.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Under <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, the prosecutor’s
    first-party disclosure obligation is to disclose all relevant <i>information</i> in its possession relating
    to the investigation of the accused.  Relevant information includes not only information related to those
    matters the prosecutor intends to adduce evidence against the accused, but also
    any information in respect of which there is a reasonable possibility that it
    may assist the accused in making full answer and defence: <i>Stinchcombe</i> at pp. 343-44; <i>R.
    v. McNeil</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at para. 17.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Well in advance of trial, defence
    counsel received information in the disclosure provided that indicated that
    investigators had compared the times recorded on the video surveillance system
    at Bramalea Secondary School with those revealed on the CAD system used for 911
    calls. The precise times were included in the notes of two police officers. In
    each instance, the difference disclosed was more than five minutes.  According to the CAD report on the incident,
    police were dispatched to the school at 11:16 a.m. and arrived there at 11:19
    a.m.  The school video system showed the
    arrival time as 11:14 a.m., two minutes earlier than the officers had even been
    dispatched according to the CAD system.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Defence counsel acknowledged that he
    had and had read the disclosure provided by the prosecutor.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Apart from the form in which it was
    made, the substance of what was recorded in the audio recording was no
    different than what had been disclosed in writing as part of the pre-trial
    first-party disclosure.  When the recording
    was disclosed, defence counsel could listen to the time check, not just read
    about it. Two senses, rather than one.  Granted, the prosecutor should have moved more quickly to turn over the
    recording once he had received it from the police. That said, later delivery in
    different form of information already disclosed lacks even the scent of
    constitutional taint. </span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Sixth Ground: Jury
    Instructions on Evidence of Gunshot Residue (GSR)</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>A chemist from the Centre of
    Forensic Sciences gave opinion evidence about the finding and significance of
    particles of gunshot residue found adhering to the steering wheel of the
    Pontiac Montana van rented by the appellant one day before the deceased was
    shot to death and on the appellant’s clothing and hands when he was arrested
    about 90 minutes after the shooting.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This evidence formed part of the
    circumstantial case advanced by the prosecutor.  The evidence tended to link the appellant and the van to discharge of a
    firearm.  Other evidence linked the
    appellant to ammunition of a calibre suitable for firing in the weapon used to
    kill the deceased, a weapon that was never found, and the van to the school at
    about the time of the shooting.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties on
    Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On this issue, Mr. Santoro for the
    appellant emphasized the importance of GSR evidence to the prosecution’s
    case.  Yet this evidence, he urged, is
    notoriously unreliable, a contributor to if not exclusively responsible for
    wrongful convictions in other jurisdictions like the United States.  The trial judge should have highlighted the
    inherent frailties in the GSR evidence, including the failure of the examining
    scientists to follow the scientific method and the substantial likelihood of
    pre-examination contamination because of the way in which the motor vehicle and
    other exhibits were handled.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[176]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Scrutton begins with a reminder
    that trial judges are not required to review every item of evidence adduced at
    trial, much less to recapitulate the submissions of counsel about individual
    items of evidence. The trial judge left the issue of contamination to the jury
    for them to consider in assessing the weight to be assigned to the expert’s
    opinion.  Instructions of the nature claimed
    here were not sought and would have invited impermissible speculation by the
    jury. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Governing
    Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At its core, this ground of appeal contests the
    adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions about the expert opinion evidence
    given by a chemist properly qualified to express opinions about the finding and
    significance of gunshot residue on the appellant, his clothing, and the van he
    rented the morning of the shooting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Complaints about the manner in which a trial judge
    refers to the evidence in final jury instructions frequently amount to claims
    of an inadequate review of the evidence on an issue or a failure to relate the
    evidence bearing on an issue to that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A trial judge is not and never has been required to
    review every item of evidence adduced at a criminal trial when summing up to
    the jury.  A failure to mention an item
    of evidence only amounts to error when the item omitted is the foundation of a
    defence: <i>R. v. Demeter</i> (1975), 10
    O.R. (2d) 321 (C.A.), at 340-41, affirmed on other grounds, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
    538.  In the absence of any affirmative
    obligation on a trial judge to recite or refer to every item of evidence
    adduced at trial, it would seem reasonable to conclude that there is equally no
    obligation on the trial judge to recapitulate the positions of the parties in
    relation to each piece of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A trial judge is required to review the substantial
    parts of the evidence and relate it to the issues upon which it has a bearing
    so that jurors can appreciate the value and effect of the evidence: <i>R. v. Azoulay</i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at
    pp. 497-98; <i>Jacquard</i> at para. 20; <i>R. v. Daley</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at
    paras. 54-58.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The defence attacks on the finding and interpretation
    of the presence of gunshot residue in this case were many and varied.  Pre-sampling contamination due to improper
    handling.  Poor collection
    techniques.  The prospect of
    contamination from extraneous sources, such as the rear seat of a police
    cruiser, contact with officers who had recently fired or been near a fired
    gun.  Many of the attacks were based on
    suggestions put to the chemist derived from articles contained in publications
    with which the expert was either not familiar or did not recognize as
    authoritative.  The suggestions,
    unadopted by the witness, did not, upon rejection, become evidence of their contents.</p>

lang=EN-US>The trial judge reviewed the
    substance of the expert opinion evidence on gunshot residue.  He pointed out that the expert’s findings
    could be explained by or originate from the appellant having fired a gun or
    having been in close proximity to another person who had fired a gun.  The judge also explained that the particles
    could also have been transferred from another source to which they had adhered
    to the items on which they were found.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[184]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge reminded the jurors
    of the evidence that, despite the large number of particles on the appellant’s

    the possibility of transfer could not be discounted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[185]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge also told the jurors
    about the evidence of contamination from brake parts and the failure to follow
    a protocol for control sampling often used in scientific analysis.  The trial judge further reminded the jurors
    that the expert could only confirm the presence of gunshot residue, not
    identify its source or the circumstances in which it came to be on the item.</span></p>
