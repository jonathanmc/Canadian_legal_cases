  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appellant, Reid’s Heritage Homes Ltd. (“RHH”),
    appeals the judgment of Belleghem J. dated November 19, 2008, in which he
    decided that the respondent Elizabeth McKee (“McKee”) had been an employee of
    RHH and awarded her damages in lieu of 18 months notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>RHH appeals on the grounds that the trial judge erred
    in finding that the parties’ written contract had expired, that McKee was an
    employee, that 18 months was reasonable, and that McKee was not obliged to
    mitigate her damages by accepting an offer to continue her relationship for a
    period of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The principal issue on the appeal is whether McKee was
    an employee of RHH or a dependent contractor.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) <u>The
    parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1987 Agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On January 8, 1987, Orin Reid, the owner and directing
    mind of RHH, and McKee both signed an agreement that Reid wrote by hand
    entitled “Sales + Advertising Agreement”.  McKee signed it on behalf of her business style, Nu Home Consultant
    Services (“Nu Home”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Agreement provided that RHH supply approximately 69
    homes in Guelph for McKee to advertise and sell, for which McKee would charge a
    fee of $2,500 for each home that she sold.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Agreement included something of an exclusivity
    clause, providing that “RHH will have sole use of [Nu Home] services unless RHH
    agrees to allow [Nu Home] the right to sell for another company that is
    controlled by Orin Reid” and it then listed two other companies under Orin
    Reid’s control, but also added “or a company that could be formed in the
    future.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, McKee requested, and the Agreement included, a
    termination provision: “Either party can terminate this agreement for any
    reason with giving the other party 30 days notice.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Work under the Agreement and Thereafter</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is no precise, explicit evidence on how quickly
    McKee sold the 69 homes, but it was probably very quickly in 1987 because her
    reported income for 1987 was $449,300, whereas the 69 homes at $2,500 per home
    would have provided only $172,500.  After
    the first 69, RHH continued to provide homes for McKee to sell, but RHH hired
    someone else to handle the advertising aspect and paid McKee $1,500 per home
    sold instead.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Around the same time, RHH also began supplying the
    necessary stationery and forms for selling homes to McKee and RHH gave her the
    title “Sales Manager”, though RHH paid her through her corporation, whose name
    changed to Bribet Holdings Inc. (“Bribet”) in 1988.  McKee became very busy with work for RHH and
    over time she hired, trained, and managed her own subagents with whom she split
    her commissions on their sales, without intervention, direction, or
    interference from RHH.  At all times,
    McKee both invoiced RHH and paid her subagents through Bribet.  McKee testified that Reid “pretty well left
    me on my own to do what I was supposed to do.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The working relationship continued in this way.  In 2000, Reid died and his son-in-law, Tim
    Blevins, succeeded him, but the relationship continued.  However, in 2004, Blevins hired Doug Sider as
    Corporate Sales Manager and decided to restructure RHH’s entire sales force –
    which at that time consisted of a number of different contracted real estate
    agents, dependent contractors, and in-house employees – so that each
    commissioned agent would report directly to Sider.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>End of the Relationship</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Blevins told McKee on January 10, 2005, that she and
    her subagents would have to work for RHH as “direct employees”.  As part of their discussions in January
    toward negotiating for McKee to adjust to RHH’s new structure, McKee and
    Blevins discussed a 100-lot assurance to McKee for the following two
    years.  McKee, who was 64 years old,
    decided that she would agree on these terms.  Blevins referred McKee to Sider to work out the details, as McKee wanted
    to put the agreement in writing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>McKee met with Sider on February 4, 2005 to finalize a
    contract, but Sider repudiated McKee’s and Blevins’ understanding, refusing to
    agree to the 100 lots per year guarantee (having never spoken with Blevins
    about it).  Blevins wrote a letter to
    McKee on February 11, offering only a standard form employee contract with a
    14-day notice period and “first pick” of one phase of any project in
    Guelph.  In this same letter, Blevins
    opined that McKee’s subagents performed badly and this might have something to
    do with “how much [McKee was] taking off the top of every deal.”  McKee rejected this offer.  She also rejected Blevins’ March 3 offer of a
    six-month engagement whereby she could sell in her choice of one of two
    subdivisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>McKee testified that she rejected the time-limited
    offer because she felt that at her age she would do better to look for
    non-time-limited employment. Further, the “animosity” in the February 11 letter
    made her feel “uncomfortable”. However, she also testified that she would have
    returned to work for RHH if they had officially offered the January plan
    guaranteeing 100 lots in writing.  McKee
    tried and failed to get a real estate agent licence because she found studying
    difficult at her age.  In 2006, she sold
    new homes for another builder, but earned only $45,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>McKee sued RHH for wrongful dismissal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The trial judgment</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Following a four-day trial in Guelph, the trial judge
    released a 51-page judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge held that the original 1987 Agreement
    was “spent” after the sale of the initial 69 homes.  It followed that the 30-day termination
    period in that agreement did not survive to govern the consequences of McKee’s
    termination 18 years later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However, although the Agreement was “spent”, the trial
    judge found that McKee and Reid had “through their continued practice and
    business relationship, implicitly agreed that she would continue to work for
    him, and he would continue to pay her for selling homes.”  Although some terms changed from the 1987
    Agreement, she was still paid a fixed commission for each home and “it was
    implicit in the fact that she never worked for anyone else … that there must
    have been between them a tacit agreement that she would work exclusively for
    [RHH]” in a different manner to that contemplated by the Agreement but, again,
    with some continued practices.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the crucial issue of McKee’s status when she was
    terminated, the trial judge determined that McKee was an employee, not an
    independent contractor or even a dependent contractor.  On this issue, he concluded: “Finally, the
    plaintiff’s activity in the present case is part of the business of the
    defendant.  Selling the homes is the most
    integral part of the defendant’s business.  It is the defendant’s business in which the plaintiff is engaged.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge then considered the question of
    notice.  Applying the factors from <i>Bardal v. Globe &amp; Mail Ltd.</i> (1960),
    24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.), as recently confirmed in <i>Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 362, he concluded that
    McKee’s position, years of service and age, in light of the limited
    availability of comparable employment for someone of her experience, training
    and qualifications, warranted eighteen months severance in lieu of notice.  The trial judge declined to award aggravated
    or punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, the trial judge held that there was no duty on
    McKee to mitigate her damages by accepting an offer from RHH of continuing
    employment in a different position.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appellant raises four issues on the appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    trial judge err by determining that McKee was an employee, not a dependent
    contractor?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>If the
    answer to (1) is ‘Yes’, did the trial judge err by finding that the 1987
    Agreement was “spent” and that the 30-day notice period in that Agreement was,
    therefore, inapplicable?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>If the
    answer to (1) is ‘Yes’, did the trial judge err by ordering an 18-month notice
    period?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    trial judge err by holding that there was no duty on McKee to mitigate her
    damages by accepting RHH’s offer of employment in a different position?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) Employee vs. dependent
    contractor</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>RHH submits that the law provides for
    an intermediate position of “dependent contractor” between employee status and
    independent contractor status.  I
    agree.  The caselaw’s evolution
    demonstrates the existence of an intermediate category, defined by economic
    dependency in the work relationship, requiring, <i>inter alia</i>, some reasonable notice for termination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>RHH further submits that the trial judge erred in determining
    that McKee was an employee because a proper application of the law to this case
    necessitates a conclusion that McKee was a dependent contractor of the sort
    defined above.  For the reasons that
    follow, I disagree.  Although I conclude
    that a “dependent contractor” category exists, I nevertheless conclude that the
    existing principles defining the employee category remain intact.  Employing these principles, the trial judge
    concluded that McKee is an employee, a decision for which he is owed
    substantial deference.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>  (a) Existence of an Intermediate Category</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1936, this court recognized the existence of an
    “intermediate” position “where the relationship of master and servant does not
    exist but where an agreement to terminate the arrangement upon reasonable
    notice may be implied”: <i>Carter v. Bell
    &amp; Sons (Canada) Ltd.</i>, [1936] O.R. 290, at p. 297.  <i>Carter</i> emphasized the permanency of the working relationship between the parties as a
    determinant in delineating this intermediate category: see <i>Carter</i> at pp. 297-98.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A number of courts in several Canadian jurisdictions
    have since found such intermediate workers in a number of reasonable notice
    cases, particularly where the worker is economically dependent on the
    defendant, generally due to complete exclusivity or a high-level of exclusivity
    in their work: see, e.g., <i>Marbry
    Distributors Ltd. v. Avrecan International Inc. </i>(1999), 171 D.L.R. (4th)
    436 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 35-38, 46; <i>JKC
    Enterprises Ltd. v. Woolworth Canada Inc.</i> (1986), 300 A.R. 1 (Q.B.); <i>Erb v. Expert Delivery Ltd.</i> (1995), 167
    N.B.R. (2d) 113 (Q.B.), at paras. 6-14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This court impliedly recognized the existence of an
    intermediate category for work relationships involving a distributorship
    agreement in <i>Paper Sales Corporation Ltd.
    v. Miller Bros. Co. (1962) Ltd.</i> (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 460.  There, the court upheld, orally, Stark J.’s
    decision below, which held that a non-employment relationship whereby the
    plaintiff was “the exclusive distributor of the defendant’s products in [two
    provinces]” was “closer to a contract of employment than to a commission
    agency” and thereby required reasonable notice for termination: <i>Paper Sales</i> at pp. 463-64.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Mancino v. Nelson
    Aggregate Co.</i>, [1994] O.J. No. 1559 (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at paras. 9-13,
    applied the reasoning in<i> Paper Sales</i> to self-employed truckers, requiring reasonable notice where the work
    relationship was permanent and exclusive in nature, such that the plaintiff was
    in a “position of economic dependence”.<i>  Mancino</i> thereby exemplifies the
    applicability, in Ontario, of the intermediate category analysis beyond merely
    sales or distributorship relationships.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Recently, this court again impliedly recognized the
    intermediate category where the case required the court to determine the status
    of a commissioned salesperson.  In <i>Braiden v. La-Z-Boy Canada Ltd.</i> (2008), 294
    D.L.R. (4th) 172, at para. 24, Gillese J.A. noted the trial judge’s suggestion
    that a “third category of relationship has emerged, between [the
    employer-employee and independent contractor relationship categories], in which
    reasonable notice of termination must also be given”, while upholding his
    conclusion that the plaintiff, Braiden, was nevertheless an employee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, recognizing an intermediate category based on
    economic dependency accords with the statutorily provided category of
    “dependent contractor” in Ontario,<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> which the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, S.O.
    1995, c. 1, Sch. A, s. 1(1), defines as: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] person, whether or not employed under a
    contract of employment, and whether or not furnishing tools, vehicles,
    equipment, machinery, material, or any other thing owned by the dependent
    contractor, who performs work or services for another person for compensation
    or reward on such terms and conditions that the dependent contractor is in a
    position of economic dependence upon, and under an obligation to perform duties
    for, that person more closely resembling the relationship of an employee than
    that of an independent contractor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I conclude that an intermediate category exists, which
    consists, at least, of those non-employment work relationships that exhibit a
    certain minimum economic dependency, which may be demonstrated by complete or
    near-complete exclusivity.  Workers in
    this category are known as “dependent contractors” and they are owed reasonable
    notice upon termination.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>RHH submits that exclusivity and economic dependence
    are hallmarks of the dependent contractor relationship, such that although they
    take a relationship out of the independent contractor category, they do not
    give rise to an employment relationship.  Though I do not disagree with this characterization, it requires some
    refinement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Having concluded that there is an intermediate category
    between independent contractor and employee, namely “dependent contractor”, I
    also conclude that the legal principles applicable to distinguishing between
    employee and independent contractors apply equally to the distinction between
    employees and dependent contractors.  In
    this way, the dependent contractor category arises as a “carve-out” from the
    non-employment category and does not affect the range of the employment
    category.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <i>Braiden</i>,
    at para. 35, Gillese J.A. employed the general principles for distinguishing
    between an employee and an independent contractor, as laid out by Juriansz J.A.
    in <i>Belton</i> <i>v. Liberty Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.),
    at para. 11.  Had Braiden been a
    contractor, he would have been a dependent contractor, as he worked exclusively
    for the defendant, La-Z-Boy: <i>Braiden</i> at para. 35.  However, Gillese J.A. did
    not have to consider what sort of contractor Braiden might be, because she
    concluded that Braiden was in fact an employee: <i>Braiden</i> at para. 37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this way, the proper initial step is to determine
    whether a worker is a contractor or an employee, for which the <i>Sagaz</i>/<i>Belton</i> analysis, described in the next section, controls.  Under that analysis, the exclusivity of the
    worker is listed as a <i>factor</i> weighing
    in favour of the employee category (<i>Belton</i>’s
    first principle).<b>  </b>The next step, required only if the first
    step results in a contractor conclusion, determines whether the contractor is
    independent or dependent, for which a worker’s exclusivity is <i>determinative</i>, as it demonstrates
    economic dependence.  Therefore,
    exclusivity might be a “hallmark” of the dependent contractor category
    vis-à-vis the broader category of contractors.  However, it continues also as a factor in determining whether the worker
    is not a contractor at all, but rather an employee, in the first-step analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This process of analysis serves the policy purposes
    that underlie the jurisprudence.  In
    summarizing the caselaw, Geoffrey England, Roderick Wood &amp; Innis Christie, <i>Employment Law in Canada</i>, 4th ed.
    (Markham, Ont.: LexisNexis Canada) vol. 1, at s. 2.33, describes the frequently
    stated policy reasons for recognizing an intermediate category:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These decisions have frequently acknowledged the
    policy justification for using the “intermediate” status doctrine in order to
    extend the safeguards of the employment contract to self-employed workers who
    are subject to relatively high levels of subordination and/or economic
    dependency, but who, technically, do not qualify as “employees” <i>strict sensu</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Given this concern to safeguard workers who are
    formally “contractors” but who are in a position of economic vulnerability, it
    only makes sense to carve the dependent contractor category out of the broader
    existing contractor category and leave the range of the employee category
    intact.  Therefore the appropriate
    analysis for distinguishing employees from “contractors” generally is the
    existing analysis for distinguishing employees from independent contractors.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The legal principles to be applied in labelling the
    status of a work relationship admit of broad discretion to the trier of fact.  As the Supreme Court of Canada has
    recognized, “there is no one conclusive test which can be universally applied”: <i>671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries
    Canada Inc.</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 983, at para. 46.  Instead, Major J. stated, at para. 45, that
    “what must always occur is a search for the total relationship of the
    parties.”He then approvingly quoted
    MacGuigan J.A. in <i>Wiebe Door Services
    Ltd. v. M.N.R.</i>, [1986] 3 F.C. 553, at p. 563:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The most
    that can profitably be done is to examine all the possible factors which have
    been referred to in these cases as bearing on the nature of the relationship
    between the parties concerned....  [N]o
    magic formula can be propounded for determining which factors should, in any given
    case, be treated as the determining ones.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In my opinion, this language endorses a case-specific,
    discretionary analysis.  Such analyses
    are best left to the trier of fact, who is closest to the facts of the case and
    has the best handle on the true nature of the work relationship.  More specifically, the trier of fact is best
    equipped to settle the “central question” based on the balance of factors put
    forth in <i>Sagaz</i> at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The central question is whether the person who has
    been engaged to perform the services is performing them as a person in business
    on his own account. In making this determination, the level of control the
    employer has over the worker's activities will always be a factor. However,
    other factors to consider include whether the worker provides his or her own
    equipment, whether the worker hires his or her own helpers, the degree of
    financial risk taken by the worker, the degree of responsibility for investment
    and management held by the worker, and the worker's opportunity for profit in
    the performance of his or her tasks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <i>Belton</i>,
    Juriansz J.A., writing on behalf of the court, upheld the use of the following
    five principles, modelled on the <i>Sagaz</i> factors, at paras. 11, 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>1.</span><span>  </span>Whether or not the agent was limited exclusively to the service of the
    principal;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>2.</span><span style='color:black;'>  Whether or not the agent is subject to the control of the principal, not
    only as to the product sold, but also as to when, where and how it is sold;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>3.</span><span>  </span><span
style='color:black'>Whether or not the agent has an investment or interest in
    what are characterized as the “tools” relating to his service;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>4.</span><span>  </span>Whether or not the agent has undertaken any risk in the business sense
    or, alternatively, has any expectation of profit associated with the delivery
    of his service as distinct from a fixed commission;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>5.</span><span>  </span><span
style='color:black'>Whether or not the activity of the agent is part of the
    business organization of the principal for which he works. In other words,
    whose business is it?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the present case, the trial judge reviewed the <i>Sagaz</i> balancing inquiry.  Although he did not explicitly reference the
    five <i>Belton</i> principles, his
    description of the “established practice” between McKee and RHH was clearly
    patterned on them:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Principle
    1:] [T]here was a tacit agreement, carried out in practice for almost twenty
    years, that the plaintiff would sell “exclusively” for the defendant. [Principle
    2:] The defendant assigned particular subdivisions to the plaintiff, built
    model homes and told her which lots she could sell.  The defendant told her [when she] could sell,
    and maintained control over how the lots were sold.  The defendant set the prices and conditions
    of sale, and retained the right to set the hours that the model homes were
    open.... [Principle 3:] [T]he principle tool was the model home – provided by
    [RHH]. [Principle 4:] The plaintiff here had no risk in the business and was paid
    on a strictly commission basis. [Principle 5:] Finally, the plaintiff’s
    activity in the present case is part of the business of the defendant.  Selling the homes is the most integral part
    of the defendant’s business.  It is the
    defendant’s business in which the plaintiff is engaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Based on this review of the practice, the trial judge
    held: “I am satisfied that the plaintiff was an ‘employee’ of the defendant
    when she was terminated in 2005.”  The
    appellant does not challenge the trial judge’s summary of these facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Instead, the appellant submits that the trial judge’s
    error in determining that McKee was an employee was based, in part, on a
    palpable and overriding factual error in finding that McKee had “a limited
    freedom to recruit others also to work exclusively for [RHH], but only to the
    extent that they worked under her and discharged her own sales
    responsibilities.”  For RHH, this
    limitation actually underscores that she was a dependent contractor, so the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence.  However,
    the trial judge does not offer this finding as a factor weighing in favour of
    employee status, as RHH submits.  Instead, he makes this finding in the context of characterizing the work
    that continued after the 1987 Agreement was “spent”.  It continued “pursuant [to] a mutual
    understanding” or “tacit agreement”.  It
    incorporated elements of the 1987 Agreement, but evolved over the subsequent 18
    years in several aspects, such as McKee’s “limited freedom” to hire
    subagents.  Read in context, therefore,
    this finding was to establish that the 1987 Agreement ended and the ensuing
    relationship evolved therefrom, and was not material to deciding that McKee was
    an employee.  Therefore, the deference
    due in this case is not undermined by palpable and overriding factual errors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  As such, I
    would defer to the trial judge, unless the facts of this case could not support
    the trial judge’s decision that McKee is an employee under the applicable legal
    principles.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>  (d) Employee Determination Defensible under Law</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In my opinion, the trial judge’s decision is defensible
    under the legal principles defining work relationships and the employee
    category.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Recently, Gillese J.A., writing on behalf of the court,
    applied the <i>Belton </i>principles in <i>Braiden</i>, at paras. 33-36.  She emphasized the fifth principle at para.
    34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In many ways, the question posed at the end of the
    fifth principle -- whose business is it? -- lies at the heart of the matter.
    Was the individual carrying on business for him or herself or was the
    individual carrying on the business of the organization from which he or she
    was receiving compensation?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gillese J.A. considered Braiden’s relationship with
    La-Z-Boy under each of the principles and concluded that Braiden was an
    employee: <i>Braiden</i> at para. 35.  Her comprehensive consideration of each
    principle further elucidates their meaning and facilitates application to this
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the first principle: McKee, like Braiden, also
    worked exclusively for the defendant company and the trial judge found that
    this was pursuant to her implied agreement with RHH.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second: the trial judge’s findings demonstrate that
    McKee was, as Gillese J.A. characterized Braiden’s work relationship, subject
    to the defendant’s control as to “where [s]he was to sell, the promotional
    methods [s]he was to use, what [s]he was to sell and how much [s]he was to sell
    it for.”  With respect to the promotional
    methods, the evidence revealed that RHH took advertising responsibilities away
    from McKee.  This is indicative of the
    sort of specialization of tasks that one expects to find with respect to an
    in-house agent rather than an independent, or even dependent, realty firm.  Gillese J.A. also noted that La-Z-Boy
    “regularly monitored Mr. Braiden’s sales performance and measured it against
    the performance of other of La-Z-Boy’s sales agents”.  Although the trial judge did not refer to it,
    there was also evidence in this case that RHH had engaged “professional
    shoppers” to review the sales performance of McKee’s subagents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third: the third principle places McKee’s situation
    further in favour of employee status than Braiden’s.  Gillese J.A. questioned the applicability of
    the “tools” consideration to the case at hand, but noted, at para. 36: “If
    ‘tools’ includes anything necessary to perform one’s contractual responsibilities,
    it would encompass Mr. Braiden’s car and office, both of which he furnished and
    maintained at his own expense.”  McKee,
    by contrast, performed her sales function in model homes provided by RHH and
    the evidence indicates that RHH supplied her stationery and forms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth: McKee, like Braiden, “was financially dependent
    on [the defendant] and had no expectation that [s]he might earn a profit as
    distinct from the fixed commissions.”  Throughout the contract, McKee’s profit was based on “fixed commissions”
    from RHH alone.  Further, there is no
    indication that McKee risked any significant capital in her sales operation,
    given that RHH supplied the necessary facilities and “tools”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, fifth: although RHH gradually came to make use
    of other sales services in addition to McKee’s, the evidence suggests that,
    like Braiden, “the sales force of which [McKee] was a member was a crucial
    element of [RHH’s] business organization.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, RHH submits a number of reasons that <i>Braiden</i> should be distinguished.  However, I do not find them persuasive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, the submission that McKee differs in that
    Braiden began his work relationship as an employee places the cart before the
    horse: McKee’s status in her work for RHH since the end of the 1987 Agreement
    is the issue at hand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the fact that McKee operated through a business
    in her work for RHH from the beginning is not determinative of her work status:
    see <i>Braiden</i> at para. 30; <i>Kordish v. Innotech Multimedia Corp.</i> (1998), 46 C.C.E.L. (2d) 318, at paras. 16-17 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), aff’d
    [2000] O.J. No. 2557 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, I am of the opinion that an “employee” can have
    the intermediary relationship between subordinate staff and higher management
    that McKee did.  As RHH submits, McKee
    preferred that RHH communicate with “her sales staff” through her.  However, this is consistent with certain
    organizational set-ups where employees who manage certain divisions, such as
    sales, act as a conductor between higher management and staff within their
    division.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, it is true that McKee obtained greater profit
    than a salesperson in Braiden’s situation by employing subagents.  However, McKee’s services to RHH included
    supervision of a subordinate sales staff, for which she received a fixed
    commission.  Therefore, in respect of the
    facts relevant to principle 4, McKee did not have an “expectation of profit in
    the delivery of her services” distinct from a “fixed commission”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As such, I adopt Gillese J.A.’s conclusion in <i>Braiden</i>, at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, I see no basis on which to interfere
    with the trial judge's determination that the continued relationship between
    the appellant and [respondent] was that of employer and employee. This
    determination was based on careful, thorough findings of fact which are fully
    supported on the record, and was responsive to the issues raised by the
    parties. Although the reasons do not identify the factors set out above, the
    findings reflect a consideration of the appropriate factors.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The 1987 Agreement</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The 1987 Agreement provided that either party could
    terminate the agreement by giving the other party 30 days notice.  The appellant concedes that if McKee was an
    employee at RHH throughout the 1987-2005 duration of their relationship, the
    30-day notice period in the 1987 Agreement would contravene s. 57 of the <i>Employment Standards Act 2000</i>, S.O. 2000,
    c. 41.  I agree.  Accordingly, since McKee was an employee, not
    a dependent contractor, this issue does not arise.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3) <u>Reasonable notice</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If McKee was a dependent contractor, RHH would
    challenge the 18-month notice ordered by the trial judge.  However, I have determined that McKee was an
    employee.  RHH does not contend that an
    18-month notice order for an employee in McKee’s position and circumstances is
    unreasonable.  Hence this issue does not
    arise.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4) <u>Mitigation</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>RHH contends that McKee failed to mitigate her damages
    by declining to accept RHH’s offer on March 3, 2005 of continuing employment
    for six months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge carefully reviewed and applied the
    recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with mitigation in an
    employment law context, <i>Evans v.
    Teamsters Local Union No. 31</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 661.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge described the parties’ two-month-long negotiations
    over McKee’s continuing role with RHH in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The circumstances surrounding her dismissal related
    to a drastic reduction in her responsibilities and income earning capacity,
    both of which must have been seriously demoralizing.  Despite this, she agreed to stay on if
    mutually agreeable conditions of employment could be arranged.  She was sixty-four years of age.  She had given, what could arguably be said
    were, her best earning years to the defendant company.  Had the situation not deteriorated over the
    two months following her initial meeting with Mr. Blevins, the employer in this
    case may have been able to mount a successful argument that she ought to have
    returned in order to mitigate her damages, at least for the six months proposed
    in one of the final offers to her.  However, those final offers themselves, when looked at in the context of
    Mr. Blevins’ admittedly “angry” letter, demonstrate that the relation between
    the defendant and the plaintiff had already drastically changed.  By the final letter, the relationship was
    irreparably damaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In my view, the record amply supports this
    analysis.  Although McKee was willing to
    consider continuing to work for RHH when this was being discussed in January
    2005, the course of negotiations between January and March, with the nasty and
    hurtful February 11 letter from Blevins to McKee in the middle of that period,
    caused such a rupture that it would be unfair to conclude that McKee had a duty
    to accept RHH’s offer of time-limited continuing employment.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
