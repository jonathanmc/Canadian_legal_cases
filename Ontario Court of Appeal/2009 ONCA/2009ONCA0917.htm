    March 31, 2009, dismissing his motion to set aside the order of Loukidelis
    J.  This last-mentioned order, made on
    consent, dismissed Rashid’s action.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This action was originally commenced on June 13, 2003.  Rashid sought $500,000 for the return of
    funds paid to the respondent, Ann Shaher, pursuant to a promise of marriage and
    for punitive damages arising from Shaher’s alleged fraudulent misrepresentation.
    Shaher had promised to marry Rashid.  In
    fact, she was already married.</span></p>

    delivered and on September 16, 2003, pursuant to minutes of settlement dated
    August 8, 2003, Loukidelis J. dismissed the action on consent. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The minutes of settlement required Shaher to pay $90,000 to
    Rashid by way of two promissory notes.  The first promissory note, for $30,000, was to be paid in full no later
    than January 31, 2004.  The second note,
    for $60,000, was to be paid five years from January 31, 2004, and was to be
    secured by a collateral mortgage in the amount of $60,000, given by Shaher’s
    sister, Mona, to Rashid.  Based on the
    agreement, Rashid withdrew his lawsuit against Shaher.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The parties disagreed over whether Shaher fulfilled her
    obligations under the settlement agreement.  Rashid took the view that Shaher had not complied with the agreement, and
    he served Shaher with a notice of motion dated May 15, 2008, whereby he moved
    under rule 59.06(2)(a) to set aside the consent dismissal. The motion was
    brought on the basis of facts arising or discovered after the order was made or
    fraud.  The claimed “facts arising” after
    the order involved the failure of Shaher’s solicitor to carry out his alleged
    personal undertaking to fully implement the minutes.  Rashid also alleges that the consent order
    was obtained by Shaher’s fraud in entering into the minutes of settlement. Rashid
    also sought an order enforcing the settlement agreement.  </span></p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The motion judge dismissed the
    motion on the basis that there were no new facts to justify setting aside the
    consent order and there was no genuine issue for trial with respect to fraud in
    the formation of the minutes of settlement.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge found that Rashid’s real complaint was that Shaher
    had failed to perform her obligations under the minutes of settlement.  The appropriate approach, therefore, was to
    bring an action to enforce the settlement.  Furthermore, the motion
    judge held that Rashid had not adequately explained his delay of over four
    years in pursuing the matter.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Before this court, Rashid’s primary submission is that the
    motion judge erred in his analysis of fraud by using the test for summary
    judgment and by ignoring certain evidence that supports a finding of fraud in
    the sense that Shaher entered into the settlement knowing that she had no
    intention of fulfilling her part of the bargain.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>During argument, counsel for Shaher advised that his client
    had commenced an action against Rashid in which Rashid had asserted a
    counterclaim.  Counsel for Shaher agrees
    that all of the relief that Rashid seeks in respect of the alleged breach of
    the minutes of settlement can be asserted in that counterclaim.  He further conceded that, if necessary, the
    counterclaim could be amended to ensure that all relevant issues are before the
    court.  He also said that he did not
    anticipate a limitation defence.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    order to let the matter proceed where it should, in the new action.</span></p>

    order as to the costs of this appeal. </span></p>
