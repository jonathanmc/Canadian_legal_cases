    feet off the ground.  Each window had a
    number of glass windowpanes, each measuring about 3 feet by 3.5 feet, arranged

    window. The panes had been removed from the plastic clips that held them in

    removed from the windows.  The print[s] -
    and I’m satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that that print[s] belongs to the
    accused.  The prints were attributed by
    the investigating officer on the scene to be at the [edge] of the glass.  The inference being is that the person
    removing the glass -- those prints belonged to the person removing the glass as
    removing glass is usually held by the [edge] rather than on the centre portion.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the evidence before me, I have considered the
    defence arguments understanding that [it] is not obligatory on the defence to
    prove anything, the onus remains on the Crown.  I acknowledge that there is no evidence of motive here. There is no
    evidence of opportunity with respect to the part of the accused.  But [given] the location of the window and
    the evidence before me, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown
    has made out its case against the accused.</p>

    forward by counsel, with the <i>caveat</i> that given the abundance of “fingerprint cases”, it is not surprising that
    there were decisions of this court upon which each side could rely.  However, as Doherty J.A. observed in <i>Mars </i>at para. 5, the application of the
    reasonableness standard involves a certain weighing of the evidence.  As such, the process is case-specific, and
    the assistance of other fingerprint cases is restricted to informing judicial

    several men who committed a home invasion.  One of the victims testified that, after an extended struggle, he chased
    the perpetrators out the door and watched one jump over a car by placing his
    hand on the front of the car and leaping over it as he fled.  </span></p>

    the accused’s fingerprint that the police lifted from the windshield of the

    fingerprint evidence, taken with other available evidence, was capable of
    supporting a reasonable inference that it was the accused who ran from the
    house and touched the car as he fled from the scene of the crime, or whether
    the print could just as likely have been placed on the windshield at some other
    time and place.</span></p>

    evidence of his fingerprints on the windows demonstrates only that he touched

    evidence put forward by the Crown to support the link between him and the crime,

    case.  As I have said, the fingerprint
    evidence clearly established that the appellant, at some point in time, had touched
    the windows.  However, the probative
    value of this evidence depended on whether the entirety of the evidence
    reasonably permitted the inference that the appellant touched the windows in
    connection with the August 2006 break-in and not at some other time.  The fingerprint evidence by itself did not
    permit any such inference.  The reasonableness
    of the inference that the appellant touched the windows in connection with the
    break-in depends, therefore, on whether it could reasonably be drawn from the
    evidence other than the fingerprints themselves.</span></p>

    the officer may have meant that “a lot of” the prints were lifted from the

    circumstances, the appellant’s failure to advance an innocent explanation
    cannot add weight to the Crown’s case so as to justify drawing what would
    otherwise be an unreasonable inference of guilt: <i>R. v. LePage</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), at pp. 396-97.  Only “where the prosecution’s case, standing
