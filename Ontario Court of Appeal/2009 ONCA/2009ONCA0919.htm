  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    of the Province of Ontario, as represented by the Minister of Transportation
    for the Province of Ontario (the “MTO”), and Kansa General International
    Insurance Company Ltd., in Liquidation (“Kansa”), appeal from the judgment of

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>declarations
    that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i) CSC was obliged to
    defend the MTO in a third party proceeding commenced against the MTO by Huron
    Construction Company Ltd. and Huron Gravel Ltd. (collectively, “Huron”) at
    CSC’s own expense and to pay the costs associated with the MTO’s counterclaim
    against Huron and of the MTO’s defence of the main action in the construction
    accident litigation (the “accident litigation”), including the costs of
    investigation; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii) CSC is obliged to
    indemnify the MTO in respect of amounts for which the MTO has been found liable
    to Huron in the accident litigation; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>judgment
    against CSC for all amounts paid by Kansa to satisfy Huron’s claims and for all
    expenses incurred by Kansa in defence of Huron’s claims and the claims asserted
    in the accident litigation, including in MTO’s counterclaim proceeding against
    Huron</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(<span class=GramE>the</span> “coverage litigation”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>It is not necessary for the disposition of this
    appeal to address all the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellants.  In our view, notwithstanding the able
    submissions of the appellants’ counsel in this court, the appeal must be
    dismissed for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>First, the appellants contend that by the
    combined effect of a certificate of insurance issued by an insurance broker in
    favour of Huron (the involved MTO contractor) and the MTO, and a comprehensive
    general liability insurance policy issued by CSC in favour of Huron (the “CSC
    Policy”), coverage was afforded to the MTO for the damages and expenses at
    issue.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The certificate refers to the construction
    contract between the MTO and Huron, which required Huron to obtain insurance
    coverage against loss or damage resulting from bodily injury that named the MTO
    as an additional insured and protected the MTO against all claims for all
    damage or injury “resulting from or arising out of any act or omission on the
    part of the contractor or any of his servants or agents during the execution of
    the contract”.  The trial judge found
    that Huron was not obliged under the construction contract to obtain insurance
    coverage for claims concerning the MTO’s own conduct.  We agree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Based on the specific wording of the certificate
    and the CSC Policy, we are of the opinion that any coverage afforded thereunder
    to the MTO was limited, at least, to claims based on the MTO’s vicarious liability
    for the acts or omissions of Huron and its representatives.  However, the liability findings made against
    the MTO in the accident litigation do not engage vicarious liability on the
    part of the MTO.  On the contrary, they
    involve acts or omissions of the MTO’s own personnel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Second, the appellants also submit that the
    coverage claimed was afforded to the MTO by virtue of Endorsement 18 (Revised)
    to the CSC Policy.  Again, we disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>These sophisticated parties were represented
    throughout by highly experienced insurance counsel.  The record establishes that <span
class=GramE>counsel were</span> alive to the coverage issues arising from the
    certificate, the CSC Policy and the Endorsement from an early stage of the
    accident litigation.  On a fair reading
    of the record, the parties’ counsel, including the MTO’s counsel, did not view
    the Endorsement as affording any coverage to the MTO beyond that pertaining to
    liability arising out of Huron’s operations.  However, as we have already indicated, the liability findings made
    against the MTO in the accident litigation concerned acts or omissions of the
    MTO’s own personnel, not the acts or omissions or, more generally, the
    operations of Huron or its personnel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>We note that the MTO sought and obtained its own
    comprehensive general liability insurance coverage from Kansa.  If the CSC Policy was intended or expected by
    the parties to respond in the fashion now asserted by the MTO, this separate
    coverage from Kansa would appear to have been unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>We also note that, towards the close of the
    trial in the coverage litigation, the appellants abandoned their negligence
    claims against their former counsel.  These claims were inconsistent, at least in part, with the appellants’
    assertion of expansive coverage under the certificate and the CSC Policy, or
    alternatively, under the CSC Policy and the Endorsement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge in the coverage litigation held
    that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Both <span class=GramE>counsel</span> were clearly
    of the belief and understanding that the [CSC Policy] only protected M.T.O.
    against liability claims if M.T.O. were liable for some act of Huron, and not
    for any independent negligent acts which may result in a loss.  This was the commercial expectation of the
    parties and the commercial reality of their legal relationship.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo>These findings were open to the trial judge on this evidential
    record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Third, it is undisputed that the appellants did
    not make any claim against CSC of the type now advanced until 1998 – more than
    eight years after the commencement of the third party proceeding against the
    MTO in the accident litigation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge in the coverage litigation held
    that it was unreasonable in these circumstances for Kansa, as the MTO’s primary
    insurer, to now advance enlarged coverage claims against CSC, “having
    acquiesced by delay and rested upon its rights”.  He further ruled that if CSC had been
    informed earlier that the MTO might seek “anything other than liability
    coverage if [the] MTO were liable for some act of Huron … the issue could have
    been determined and the course of the trial and appeal [in the accident
    litigation] might have been entirely different”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>We agree.  There was evidence before the trial judge of prejudice caused to CSC by
    the appellants’ delay in attempting to invoke coverage under the CSC Policy for
    claims unrelated to the MTO’s vicarious liability for Huron’s acts or omissions
    or claims arising out of Huron’s operations.  Having elected not to pursue such recourse against CSC until after final
    judgment in the accident litigation, for reasons of their own having to do with
    the defence of the accident litigation, the appellants are now precluded from
    doing so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Finally, it is our view that the trial judge’s
    findings in the coverage litigation regarding CSC’s good faith conduct are
    unassailable on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The appeal is dismissed.  CSC is entitled to its costs of the appeal, fixed
    in the total amount of $18,636, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
