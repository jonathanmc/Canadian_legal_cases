  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Moldaver J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      Following her trial before Benotto J. and
    a jury, the appellant was convicted of second degree murder in connection with
    the drowning death of her daughter, Scarlett. The appellant appeals from
    conviction and raises a number of issues, only two of which I propose to
    address.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      The first issue relates to the
    admissibility of certain evidence given by Dr. Taylor, the pathologist who
    performed the autopsy on Scarlett. In particular, the appellant submits that
    the trial judge erred in permitting Dr. Taylor to give evidence about the
    nature and timing of certain bruises located at the back of Scarlett’s neck and
    the means by which they may have been caused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      The second issue relates to the trial
    judge’s instructions on the included offence of manslaughter. Although counsel
    for the appellant framed the issue differently in his notice of appeal and
    factum, the debate before us centred on the adequacy of the trial judge’s
    instructions and whether the jury was given the information it needed to
    properly assesses whether, at the time of the drowning, the appellant possessed
    one or other of the requisite intents for murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      For reasons that follow, I would not give
    effect to the first ground of appeal. I am however, of the view, that the
    second ground has merit and that a new trial must be ordered.  Because of that, I propose to limit my review
    of the facts to a minimum.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Overview of Salient Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      On July 12, 2004, the appellant and her
    husband discovered the lifeless body of their four-and-a half year old
    daughter, Scarlett, submerged in the bathtub of their home. She was naked and
    unconscious and there was vomit on her face. Efforts by family members and
    medical personnel to resuscitate her proved futile. Dr.&nbsp;Taylor, the paediatric
    pathologist who performed the autopsy, attributed the cause of death to
    drowning – a finding that no one disputes. The focus at trial centred on the
    circumstances surrounding the drowning and the manner by which it had come
    about. According to the Crown, Scarlett was drowned by the appellant; according
    to the appellant, Scarlett drowned as a result of a tragic accident in which
    she played no part.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      Evidence presented at trial showed that
    Scarlett’s short life had been marred by medical and family issues. Scarlett
    was the only child of the appellant and her husband David. The appellant
    suffered from health issues and found it difficult to care for Scarlett.
    Eventually, at age 20 months, Scarlett was sent to China where she spent the
    next two and a half years living with her maternal grandmother.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      While in China, problems were noted with
    Scarlett’s speech development and communication skills. At age 4, she could not
    speak and did not play with other children. She also exhibited temper tantrums
    and refused to follow instructions. Doctors in China attributed her developmental
    delay to a condition known as Hydrocephalus – in lay terms, a “water bubble” on
    her brain.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      Several months after her fourth birthday,
    Scarlett and her grandmother returned to Canada, where it was felt that Scarlett
    would receive better medical attention. Her parents were hopeful that a
    corrective solution could be found to address her developmental problems. Unfortunately,
    that was not to be the case. After several months of testing, Scarlett was
    found to be autistic. On the day of Scarlett’s death, the appellant and her
    husband were told that corrective surgery was out of the question and that
    Scarlett would never function normally. At the same time, however, they were
    informed that Scarlett was only mildly autistic and there was a potential for
    major improvement. Various services and educational opportunities were
    available and steps were taken that day to set them in motion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>      After returning home from the doctor’s
    office at about 4:00 p.m., the appellant remained alone with Scarlett for about
    three-and-a-half hours while her husband and mother attended to other matters.
    This was the first time that the appellant had been alone with Scarlett since Scarlett’s
    return from China a few months earlier. In several statements made to the
    police, the appellant explained that Scarlett had been very naughty all
    afternoon. She had been running around and getting into mischief and the
    appellant described her behaviour as “horrible” – she could “hardly take more”.
    The afternoon was “very frustrating” and she had made numerous attempts to reach
    her husband and have him come home.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>According to the
    appellant, at around 6:00 p.m., she managed to put Scarlett down for a nap and
    Scarlett fell asleep within half-an-hour. The appellant then went downstairs
    and watched television until around 7:30 p.m., when her husband and mother
    returned home. At that time, she accompanied her husband upstairs and
    discovered that Scarlett was not in bed. The appellant and her husband then looked
    in the bathroom and saw Scarlett’s lifeless body in the bathtub, submerged
    under the water. They immediately called 911 and the appellant’s mother and her
    husband tried to resuscitate Scarlett before the police and ambulance personnel
    arrived.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Earlier that
    afternoon, the appellant had placed some kitchen utensils and the shower
    curtain in the bathtub to let them soak in detergent and water. Photographs of
    the scene taken by the police showed those items in a small bassinette located
    on the floor beside the bathtub. The shower curtain had been folded up and it
    too was in the bassinette. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Forensic testing
    revealed that the walls surrounding the bathtub, as well as the top and
    exterior of the tub, had been wiped or scrubbed clean. There were no marks
    within the total bathtub area that would indicate it had been touched at all.
    In contrast, the other half of the bathroom showed many areas that had been
    touched and the vanity and toilet were dusty and covered in cobwebs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>On autopsy, Scarlett
    was found to be otherwise normal and healthy, with no signs of prior abuse. The
    entire front of her torso, including her chest, arms, legs and face showed no
    signs of bruising or any other signs of trauma. On her backside, no signs of
    trauma were noticed until the second day of the autopsy, when Dr. Taylor, for
    the first time, observed a tiny bruise on her lower back. With the guidance and
    assistance of two highly qualified forensic pathologists, Dr. Taylor layered
    back the skin on Scarlett’s backside and noticed several more tiny bruises, two
    of which were symmetrical and located at the back of Scarlett’s neck. As for
    the appellant, no scratches or injuries of any kind were found on her hands,
    arms, or face following the event.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Appellant’s Position at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>At trial, the
    appellant took the position that Scarlett’s death resulted from a tragic
    accident in which she played no part. Scarlett was a healthy, well-cared for,
    well-nourished child. Despite Scarlett’s problematic behaviour, the appellant
    loved her and she had never abused the child. Programs were available to assist
    with Scarlett’s mild autism and major improvements could be expected. The
    physical evidence belied the notion that the appellant had violently submerged
    Scarlett in the bathtub. Scarlett had no defensive injuries on her body and the
    appellant was injury-free. Dr. Taylor’s evidence as to the nature, timing and
    potential causes of the bruising found on Scarlett’s neck was speculative and,
    in any event, it did not provide conclusive or indeed any proof that Scarlett
    had been forcibly drowned.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s Position at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The Crown at trial
    maintained that Scarlett had been forcibly drowned and that the appellant was
    responsible. According to the Crown, the appellant and Scarlett had never
    bonded. Scarlett was a difficult child and the appellant could not cope with
    her. Faced with the prospect that Scarlett would never be normal and brought to
    the brink by Scarlett’s horrible behaviour on the afternoon in question, the appellant
    took the opportunity, when Scarlett was in the bathtub, to forcibly drown her. The
    finding of the kitchen utensils and the folded shower curtain in the bassinette
    beside the tub belied the notion that Scarlett had wondered into the bathroom, removed
    those items, neatly folded the shower curtain, entered the tub and then accidentally
    drowned. The scene, instead, provided strong proof that the appellant, who was
    alone with Scarlett at the time, removed those items before Scarlett entered
    the tub and was present when she drowned. While acknowledging that the medical
    evidence was not conclusive, the Crown relied on Dr. Taylor’s opinion that the
    two symmetrical bruises at the back of Scarlett’s neck likely occurred within
    four hours of her death and that they may have been caused by the shearing of
    tiny blood vessels “if Scarlett were on her back and, being restrained ... and
    attempting to raise her head against the restraint”.  The Crown also pointed to the “clean-up” of
    the bathtub area, suggesting that the appellant had been responsible and that this
    post-offence conduct constituted “a devastatingly damning piece of evidence”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In sum, the Crown
    maintained that in its totality, the circumstantial evidence provided
    conclusive proof that the appellant had murdered Scarlett by forcibly drowning
    her in the bathtub.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Against that backdrop,
    I turn to the two central issues on appeal. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue One: Did the trial judge err in
    permitting Dr. Taylor to testify about the nature, timing and potential causes
    of the two bruises located at the back of Scarlett’s neck?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The appellant submits
    that Dr. Taylor should not have been permitted to testify about the nature,
    timing or potential causes of the two bruises located at the back of Scarlett’s
    neck because Dr. Taylor did not have the forensic training required to give
    those opinions.  In short, he was a paediatric
    pathologist, not a forensic pathologist, and, as he readily conceded, his
    understanding of bruising was, at best, moderate and others had far more
    experience than he did.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>As for the substance
    of his evidence, he acknowledged that the theory which the Crown wished to
    advance – that the two symmetrical bruises at the back of Scarlett’s neck were
    caused by straining her head and neck in response to restraint – was one of
    many possibilities and in that sense, of little value to the jury. Permitting
    Dr. Taylor to give evidence supportive of the Crown’s theory ran the risk that
    the jury would accept it and use it as proof that the appellant had forcibly
    held Scarlett down, when there was no other evidence to substantiate that
    conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>I would not give effect
    to the appellant’s submissions. The trial judge gave thoughtful and cogent
    reasons for permitting Dr. Taylor to give the evidence he did. She held, properly
    in my <span class=GramE>view, that</span> his evidence regarding the cause of
    bruising was not “speculative but the result of 16 years of high-level
    experience as a paediatric pathologist” in which he had dealt extensively with
    the sudden death of children.  The trial
    judge further observed, correctly in my view, that “the fact that others may be
    more qualified than he is does not disqualify him as an expert in this area.
    Any deficiencies go to weight, not to threshold admissibility”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>As for the reliability
    of Dr.&nbsp;Taylor’s evidence, the trial judge noted that in arriving at his
    opinions about the bruises located on Scarlett’s body, and particularly the two
    at the base of her neck, Dr. Taylor “called in two forensic pathologists and
    consulted with them”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>As for the risk the
    jury would give Dr. Taylor’s evidence undue significance, the trial judge
    observed that Dr. Taylor was “quick to acknowledge the limitations of his
    expertise” and “very balanced in listing the possible causes of bruising”.
    Moreover, his testimony was “but one potential piece of evidence for the jury
    to consider”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In the circumstances,
    I can detect no errors in the trial judge’s analysis or conclusion. Dr.
    Taylor’s evidence was clearly necessary. It cannot be said – nor does the
    appellant suggest otherwise – that the jury would have known, without expert
    assistance, that bruising can be caused when someone “strains against
    restraint” – and it was essential that the jury have that evidence to prevent
    any suggestion by the defence that Scarlett’s body exhibited no injuries
    consistent with the Crown’s theory. Put differently, the Crown was entitled to
    present the jury with evidence capable of showing that its theory was at least
    plausible, having regard to the physical evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>That said<span
class=GramE>,</span> I would simply add, for purposes of the new trial, that a
    short, sharp warning about the limitations of Dr. Taylor’s evidence would not
    have been out of order. In the circumstances, I believe that a brief limiting
    instruction, along the following lines, would have been useful:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“In assessing the significance and
    weight to be afforded to Dr.&nbsp;Taylor’s evidence, you must bear in mind the
    limitations on his evidence. He does not know how Scarlett sustained the
    bruises on her neck and was not expressing an opinion about that issue. As he
    explained, it is not possible to determine, based on a physical examination,
    exactly when and how the bruises were caused. It is up to you to consider his
    evidence in the context of the whole of the evidence given at trial and to
    determine the weight and significance to be afforded to it. His evidence may
    assist you, it may not. In the end, that will be a matter for you to determine.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>All in all, I am
    satisfied that Dr. Taylor’s evidence was properly received. Accordingly, I
    would not give effect to the first ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue Two:
    Was the jury adequately instructed on the included offence of manslaughter?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>I preface my remarks
    on this issue by noting that the trial judge’s instructions on manslaughter
    were not challenged by defence counsel, nor did Crown counsel at trial [not Ms.
    Shai or Ms.&nbsp;Nakelsky] raise any concerns about them. Beyond that, defence
    counsel provided no assistance to the trial judge as to the defence position on
    manslaughter and how the jury should be instructed in relation to it. On my
    review of the record, including the oral and written submissions provided by
    defence counsel to the trial judge in anticipation of the charge, defence
    counsel simply took the view that in light of the position taken by the Crown in
    its closing address, murder was “no longer a possibility” and it “should not be
    left to the jury. It should be a manslaughter charge at most”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>That submission was
    not only unhelpful, it was wrong. In his closing address, Crown counsel put the
    Crown’s position to the jury as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The killing of her daughter by Ms. Peng
    is something that <i>happened on the sudden,
    in a moment of anger and frustration</i>, where she found herself in a
    situation that she was unable to cope with, and to relieve herself of a burden,
    and the opportunity presented itself to her while in the bathroom, where there
    was a tub full of water, and <i>she snapped</i> and drowned her daughter. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Later, in the same address, Crown counsel returned to that
    theme, urging the jury to find that “in a moment of frustration and rage, [the
    appellant] held her daughter under the water till she lost consciousness and
    drowned ...<span class=GramE>”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In response to the appellant’s contention that
    by virtue of its closing address, the Crown could not seek a conviction for
    murder, Crown counsel explained to the trial judge that the remarks in question
    were merely designed to inform the jury that premeditated murder was not an
    issue so far as the Crown was concerned; they were never meant to take murder
    off the table. By the same token, the Crown did not suggest that manslaughter
    should be removed from the jury’s consideration. On the contrary, the Crown obviously
    recognized that manslaughter was a viable verdict on the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In conjunction with its contention that the
    appellant’s conduct amounted to a momentary loss of control, the Crown
    maintained that the act of holding Scarlett down until she lost consciousness
    “wouldn’t have taken very long”. The Crown’s submission in this regard accorded
    with Dr. Taylor’s evidence that when someone is submerged under water, loss of
    consciousness will generally occur within a minute to three minutes but it can take
    as little as 30 seconds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown’s submission as to the length of time
    it would take for Scarlett to lose consciousness was by no means gratuitous. As
    the following excerpt from the Crown’s closing address reveals, it was designed
    to explain away the absence of significant bruising or other injuries to the
    front of Scarlett’s torso and also the lack of injuries to the appellant that
    might have been expected had Scarlett been thrashing around in the tub in a desperate
    effort to preserve herself from death:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In terms of the struggle,
    Dr. Taylor testified regarding the mechanism of drowning, <i>and my submission to you, listening to his testimony, bearing in mind
    this was a four-year-old child, it wouldn’t have taken very long for the child
    to succumb and lose consciousness and essentially stop struggling.</i> I think
    there’s a suggestion out there that you should expect to see bruising on other
    parts of her body, perhaps on the extremities if she was thrashing around;
    expect to see defensive or wounds on Ms. Peng.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my submission, those
    possible scenarios are speculative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That is the context against which the trial judge’s
    instructions on the included offence of manslaughter must be assessed. I turn
    to them now.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge began her instructions by
    informing the jury that murder required proof of a particular state of mind and
    that to convict the appellant of murder, the Crown had to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that she either meant to kill Scarlett or intended to cause
    bodily harm to Scarlett which she knew was likely to cause death and was
    reckless whether death ensued or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge next told the jury that in
    determining the appellant’s state of mind at the requisite time, the jury could
    consider “what she did or did not do; how she did or did not do it; and what
    she said or did not say”. The jury was further instructed to look at the
    appellant’s “words and conduct before, at the time, and after the unlawful act
    that caused Scarlett’s death”. As well, the jury was told to look at all of the
    circumstances that might “shed light on [the appellant’s] state of mind at the
    time” with a view to deciding “what she meant or didn’t mean to do”. In
    considering the evidence, the jury was to use its “good common sense”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge next instructed the jury on the
    common sense inference that “when a sane and sober person does something that
    has predictable consequences, that person usually intends or means to cause
    those consequences”. The trial judge cautioned the jury, however, that their
    task was to determine the person’s “actual state of mind” and that the common
    sense inference was permissive, not mandatory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To this point, the trial judge’s instructions
    were flawless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge then turned to the evidence upon
    which the Crown was relying to prove murder:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown alleges that Ms. Peng did have the state
    of mind for murder.  In particular:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>She held her under water till she lost
    consciousness. <i>According to Dr. Taylor,
    it takes a few minutes to lose consciousness</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>She left Scarlett in that state and went
    downstairs to await the return of her husband and mother and watch television.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>She made no attempts to remove Scarlett from the
    water or to resuscitate her prior to their arrival.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>After Scarlett was
    discovered by her father, Ms.&nbsp;Peng was the only one who made no effort to
    revive her. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pausing here, I note that the trial judge’s
    recitation of Dr. Taylor’s evidence regarding the time it takes to lose
    consciousness was not entirely accurate. With respect, it was incomplete and
    did not accord with the Crown’s actual submission which, as I have pointed out,
    was “it wouldn’t have taken very long for the child to succumb and lose
    consciousness and essentially stop struggling”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have already alluded to Dr. Taylor’s evidence
    that loss of consciousness can occur in as little as 30 seconds and I have
    explained why it was important for the Crown to keep that time frame short. I
    do not propose to repeat my comments. Suffice it to say that if the jury were
    to accept that it took “a few minutes” for Scarlett to lose <span class=GramE>consciousness,
    that</span> would not bode well for the appellant on the issue of intent.
    Specifically, it would cut away from the notion that she acted on the sudden,
    in the heat of the moment, quickly and impulsively, without giving much or any
    forethought to the consequences of her actions. That, of course, was the basis
    upon which the jury could find the appellant guilty of manslaughter – and it
    found credence both in the evidence and in the Crown’s closing address. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Manifestly, the appellant had difficulty coping
    with Scarlett. But there was no ``suggestion that Scarlett had ever been abused
    in the past. And the day in question was unique, in the sense that it was the
    first day that the appellant found <span class=GramE>herself</span> alone with
    Scarlett having to care for her. In the circumstances, a momentary outburst was
    by no means out of the question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Equally, while I accept that the appellant would
    not have been happy to learn that Scarlett was suffering from autism and that
    she would never function normally, the news regarding Scarlett’s condition was not
    entirely bleak. According to the doctor, her autism was mild and there was
    potential for improvement; as well, there were many supportive programs available
    to Scarlett. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In sum, having regard to the evidence in its
    entirety, including the medical evidence, I believe that manslaughter was a
    viable verdict and the appellant was entitled to have the issue of her intent
    and the evidence surrounding it, put fully and fairly to the jury.
    Unfortunately, it was not. After completing her review of the evidence in
    support of the Crown’s position, set out above, the trial judge said this to
    the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Remember, the Defence
    says that this didn’t happen at all, so she could not have had the intent to do
    it. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Nothing more was said about the defence position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In fairness, as I mentioned at the outset of this
    section, defence counsel did not object and the Crown stood by silent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In many circumstances, defence counsel’s failure
    to object will prove fatal. In oral argument before us, defence counsel
    conceded his mistake and took full responsibility for it. We appreciate his candour.
    In the end, our primary concern is to ensure, so far as possible, that justice
    is done. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the error was serious. It
    effectively precluded the jury from considering the included offence of
    manslaughter from the appellant’s perspective. That being so, I am respectfully
    of the view that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> cannot be applied to
    sustain the conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before leaving this matter, I wish to comment
    briefly on one further concern that may or may not arise at the new trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As mentioned, the Crown in its closing address
    made much of the fact that the outer surfaces of the bathtub and the areas
    surrounding it had been wiped clean. According to the Crown, this constituted
    “a devastatingly damning piece of evidence” against the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her charge, the trial judge made no mention
    of this “after-the-fact” conduct and the jury received no instructions on it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For purposes of the new trial, if the Crown
    chooses to make the “clean-up” evidence part of its case, the jury should be
    told that its use, if any, must be limited to the question whether the
    appellant caused Scarlett’s death and not whether the appellant formed the
    requisite intent for murder.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons given, I am of the view that the
    jury was not properly instructed on the included offence of manslaughter.
    Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new
    trial.</p>
