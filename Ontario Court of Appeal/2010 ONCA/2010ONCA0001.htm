    ruling admitting certain evidence obtained in violation of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The trial judge, applying <i>R. v.
    Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, the then applicable law on s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>, admitted the evidence.  This court is asked to review that decision
    using the reformulated approach to s. 24(2) set down in <i>R. v. Grant</i> (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  The appellant submits that while the trial
    judge’s ruling may have been correct as the law stood at the time of the trial,
    s. 24(2), as recalibrated in <i>Grant</i>,
    dictates that the evidence should be excluded.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal was pending when <i>Grant</i> was released by the Supreme Court
    of Canada.  The appellant is entitled to
    rely on the law as set down in <i>Grant</i>.  However, I am satisfied that in the
    circumstances of this case the application of <i>Grant</i> yields the same result as did the application of <i>Collins</i>.  The evidence was properly admitted by the trial judge.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    without a jury on one count of possession of crack cocaine for the purpose of
    trafficking and one count of breaching his probation.  The appellant appeals from his
    convictions.  The appeal is directed at his
    trafficking conviction.  If the
    conviction on the trafficking charge is quashed, the conviction on the charge
    of breach of probation also falls.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown’s case largely consisted of a number

    cocaine, each weighing about 27 grams.  Each piece was in a small, plastic bag and both bags were in a larger
    Ziploc bag.  The bag was hidden in the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the outset of the trial, the defence
    challenged the admissibility of these items, claiming that the search breached
    the appellant’s right to privacy under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and that the evidence should be excluded under s.
    24(2).  The trial judge held that the
    search did breach s.8, but that the items seized during the search should not
    be excluded from evidence under s. 24(2).  The trial proceeded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown called the officers involved in the
    search of the appellant’s residence and the discovery of the crack cocaine and
    related paraphernalia.  The defence
    called Mr. Hezron Watson, a lifelong friend of the appellant.  Mr. Watson had been a target of this
    investigation, but was not charged.  He testified
    that the drugs found in the appellant’s apartment belonged to him and that the
    appellant had no knowledge that the drugs were there.  Mr. Watson explained in his testimony that he
    had hosted a party at the appellant’s apartment on the evening of December 14,
    2005, two days before the search.  During
    the party, Mr. Watson purchased the crack cocaine from some of the other
    partygoers.  He hid it inside the
    mattress in one of the bedrooms because he was travelling to Jamaica the next
    day and thought it would be safer there than in his apartment.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge rejected Mr. Watson’s evidence and
    gave detailed reasons for doing so.  He
    went on to hold that the crack cocaine found in the appellant’s residence
    belonged to the appellant and that it, with the other evidence, established his
    guilt on the trafficking charge.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <h2>The Rejection of Watson’s Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s ruling admitting the seized crack
    cocaine is the focal point of this appeal.  Before turning to that ground of appeal, I will address the other ground
    of appeal advanced by the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial
    judge wrongly determined that Mr. Watson’s evidence describing the packaging of
    the crack cocaine placed inside the mattress was inconsistent with the evidence
    given by the police officers who discovered the crack cocaine during the search.  Counsel contends that Mr. Watson’s evidence about
    the packaging was unclear, and that, as he was never specifically confronted on
    cross-examination with the police evidence about the packaging, it was inaccurate
    and unfair to hold that his evidence was inconsistent with the police
    testimony.  Counsel submits that the so called
    rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> (1893), 6 R.
    67 (H.L.), prohibits any finding against the credibility of Mr. Watson absent
    direct confrontation on cross-examination with the substance of the police
    officers’ evidence describing the packaging.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before Mr. Watson testified for the defence, Staff
    Sergeant Longworth and the other officers involved in the search testified as
    part of the Crown’s case.  Sergeant
    Longworth indicated that two pieces of crack cocaine were found secreted inside
    the mattress.  Each piece was in its own
    baggy and the two small bags were in a larger Ziploc bag.  He was not challenged on this part of his
    testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When Mr. Watson testified, he described each
    piece of crack cocaine as being in a separate bag, but made no reference to a
    larger Ziploc bag containing the two smaller bags.  He was specifically cross-examined about the
    packaging of the drugs on more than one occasion, but the officer’s testimony
    was not put to Mr. Watson by Crown counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was open to the trial judge to find that Mr.
    Watson’s description of the packaging of the crack cocaine was inconsistent
    with the description given by Sergeant Longworth.  I do not agree that Mr. Watson’s evidence on
    this matter was unclear.  He was asked
    more than once about the packaging and made no reference to the larger bag
    containing the two smaller bags.  Nor was
    there any unfairness to the witness flowing from Crown counsel’s failure to put
    the evidence of the police officers directly to Mr. Watson on
    cross-examination.  The appellant’s trial
    counsel could have put the police officer’s evidence concerning the packaging
    to Mr. Watson on re-examination if he thought that would clarify his evidence.  Counsel did not do so, presumably because he
    decided that re-examination would not assist.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The record supported the trial judge’s finding
    that Mr. Watson’s evidence was inconsistent with that of Sergeant Longworth on
    a material matter.  As the trier of fact,
    the trial judge was entitled to use that inconsistency in determining Mr.
    Watson’s ultimate credibility.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h2>The Admissibility of the Crack Cocaine</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown and defence agreed at trial that, on
    the <i>voir dire</i>, the evidence to
    determine the admissibility of the seized items would consist of Sergeant
    Longworth’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry and a redacted version of the
    information he had sworn in December 2005 to obtain the search warrant.  The redacted version of the information had removed
    anything that could possibly identify various confidential sources who had
    supplied information relied on by Longworth as providing reasonable and
    probable grounds in support of the issuance of a search warrant.  It was clear from the contents of the
    redacted information that some of the confidential information came from
    anonymous Crime Stoppers’ tips, some came from known confidential informants of
    unproven reliability and some came from confidential informants who were known to
    Longworth and had proved reliable in the past.  The redacted version of the information was provided to counsel and the
    court prior to the preliminary inquiry.  The same redacted version was entered as an exhibit at trial and formed
    part of the record on appeal.  The
    original unredacted information is presumably being held under seal in the
    appropriate court office.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police and the Crown were under a legal
    obligation to protect the identity of confidential informants:  <i>R. v.
    Leipert</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at para. 15.  Defence counsel did not suggest at trial that he could bring his case
    within the innocence at stake exception to the confidential informant privilege,
    thereby entitling him to access to the informant’s identity.  This is the only recognized exception to that
    privilege:  <i>R. v. Leipert</i>, at paras. 20-22<span class=GramE>.  Nor</span> did trial counsel challenge the
    legitimacy of the confidential-informant claim advanced by the Crown.  Counsel did not contend that any of the
    editing was unnecessary or otherwise improper.  He did not ask the trial judge to examine the unredacted information, review
    the editing process and perhaps order further disclosure or provide judicial
    summaries of the redacted contents:  see <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at
    pp. 1460-61.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel at trial also did not ask the
    trial judge to consider the unredacted version of the information before
    determining the merits <span class=GramE>of the appellant’s s. 8 claim</span>.  Crown counsel was content to have the
    validity of the warrant and, hence, the reasonableness of the search determined
    on the contents of the redacted information.  As observed in <i>Leipert</i>, at
    para. 38:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The issue before the trial judge was whether there
    were reasonable grounds for the issuance of the warrant.  If the Crown wished to limit its defence of
    the reasonableness of the warrant and subsequent search to particular grounds,
    it was entitled to do so.  <i>At the end of the day the task of the judge
    was to make a ruling on reasonableness on the basis of the information relied
    on by the Crown.</i>  [Emphasis added.]    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In summary, the Crown was content to have the
    reasonableness of the search determined exclusively on the basis of the redacted
    information.  The defence did not
    challenge the validity of the confidential informant claims, seek access to the
    identity of those informants nor challenge the editing done by the Crown to
    protect the identity of those informants.  In my view, these positions taken on the <i>voir dire</i> have significance in the s. 24(2) analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge tested the constitutionality of
    the search by reference exclusively to the redacted information.  He concluded that the redacted information
    did not provide a basis on which a justice, acting reasonably and judicially,
    could be satisfied that the statutory prerequisites to the issuance of a search
    warrant had been met.  Consequently, the
    Crown could not rely on the search warrant as justification for the constitutionality
    of the search.  Without the warrant, the
    search was unreasonable and violated the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The Crown does not challenge that ruling in this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge proceeded to consider the admissibility
    of the seized items under s. 24(2) using the template set out in <i>Collins</i>.  The trial judge characterized the evidence as real non-conscriptive
    evidence that had no effect on the fairness of the trial.  He described the s. 8 breach as “very
    serious”, but held that the police had acted in “good faith” in their attempt
    to acquire legal authorization to conduct the search.  Finally, the trial judge observed that the
    evidence was crucial to the Crown’s case and that the charges were serious.   He
    determined that the evidence was admissible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant does not contend that the trial
    judge erred in law in his application of the <i>Collins</i> criteria.  Counsel
    submits that the application of <i>Grant</i> should yield a different result.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Grant</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada took a judicial wire brush to the 20 years of jurisprudential
    gloss that had built up around s. 24(2) and scrubbed down to the bare words of
    the section.  Chief Justice McLachlin and
    Justice Charron, writing for the majority, observed at para. 67 that “[t]he
    words of s. 24(2) capture its purpose: to maintain the good repute of the
    administration of justice”.  They
    continued at para. 68:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The phrase “bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute” must be understood in the long-term sense of maintaining the
    integrity of, and public confidence in, the justice system.  Exclusion of evidence resulting in an
    acquittal may provoke immediate criticism.  But s. 24(2) does not focus on immediate reaction to the individual
    case.  Rather, it looks to whether the
    overall repute of the justice system, viewed in the long term, will be
    adversely affected by admission of the evidence.  The inquiry is objective.  It asks whether a reasonable person, informed
    of all relevant circumstances and the values underlying the <i>Charter</i>, would conclude that the
    admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The majority identified three lines of inquiry that
    are relevant to the identification and balancing of the interests at play when
    s. 24(2) is invoked.  According to the majority,
    the trial court must examine the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i>-infringing state conduct, the impact of the <i>Charter</i> violation on the <i>Charter</i>-protected interest of the
    accused and society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The inquiry into the nature of the state conduct
    that resulted in a <i>Charter</i> breach
    seeks to place that conduct along a continuum of misconduct.  As explained in <i>Grant</i>, at paras. 72-74, the graver the state’s misconduct the
    stronger the need to preserve the long-term repute of the administration of
    justice by disassociating the court’s processes from that misconduct.  That disassociation is achieved by excluding
    the evidentiary fruits of the state misconduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the police acted in
    “good faith” in their attempt to acquire legal authorization for the search.  I accept that finding.  The police were clearly aware of the need to
    obtain a warrant and proceeded accordingly.  They cannot be said to have acted negligently
    or in ignorance of any of the applicable <i>Charter</i> requirements.  A finding of “good faith” obviously
    reduces the need for the court to disassociate itself from the state conduct
    that resulted in the <i>Charter</i> infringement, and supports the admissibility of the challenged evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not only do I agree with the trial judge’s
    finding of good faith on the part of the investigators, I can see no possible
    criticism of the police conduct on this trial record.  Throughout the process that culminated in the
    seizure of the evidence, they acted exactly as they were obligated to under the
    law.  They were required to obtain a
    warrant before entering the residence.  They did so.  They were required
    to make full disclosure to the justice of the peace.  There is no suggestion that they did not do
    so.  The police, and later the Crown,
    were legally obligated to protect the identity of the confidential informants
    by removing all material from the information that could identify the
    informants before making that material available to the defence.  They did that.  Given the manner in which the s. 8 claim was
    litigated, the police acted not only in good faith, but as required by the law.  The police conduct in this case does not fit anywhere
    on the misconduct continuum described in <i>Grant</i>,
    at para. 74.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police conduct in this case is somewhat analogous
    to the conduct considered in cases where the police have gathered evidence according
    to the law as it was understood at the time the evidence was gathered only to
    have the law changed or declared unconstitutional at some subsequent point, but
    before the evidence is tendered at trial: see e.g. <i>R. v. Duarte</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 59-60; <i>R. v. Wijesinha</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 422, at
    paras. 55-56<span class=GramE>.  In</span> those cases, the police acted not only in good faith, but in accordance with
    the law as it stood at the time.  Under
    the <i>Collins</i> approach, real evidence
    obtained in this manner was inevitably admitted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The nature of the state conduct resulting in the
    constitutional infringement in this case seems to fall outside the paradigm
    described in <i>Grant</i>.  If it is within that paradigm, it is clearly
    at the far end of the spectrum favouring admissibility.  The appellant has not availed himself of the
    various options open to him that would potentially have allowed further
    assessment of the police conduct.  In
    these circumstances it would be inappropriate to presume that the police did
    anything other than conduct themselves in accordance with the applicable legal
    rules.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second line of inquiry directed in <i>Grant</i> – the impact of the breach on the <i>Charter</i>-protected interest of the
    accused – points strongly toward exclusion of the evidence.  As the trial judge observed, this was a “very
    serious breach” of the appellant’s constitutional rights.  The appellant had a high expectation of
    privacy in his own residence.  That
    privacy was compromised by an intrusive and extensive police search.  The powerfully-negative impact on the core of
    the appellant’s legitimate privacy interests creates the risk that the
    admission of the fruits of the search could bring the administration of justice
    into disrepute:  <i>R. v. Grant</i>, at paras. 76-78.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The seriousness of the impact of the breach on
    the appellant is not mitigated by the fact that the police may have had
    reasonable and probable grounds when they obtained the warrant, but were unable
    to demonstrate those grounds at trial because of the confidential-informant
    privilege.  The Crown chose to proceed on
    the redacted information.  The
    assessments of whether there was a breach and of the impact of that breach on
    the appellant must be measured against the substance of that redacted
    information.  Assessed from that
    perspective, this was an extensive, unjustified search of the appellant’s home.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The third arm of the inquiry mandated by <i>Grant</i> looks to society’s interest in an
    adjudication of a criminal trial on its merits.  As indicated in <i>Grant</i> at para.
    82:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The fact that the evidence obtained in breach of the <i>Charter</i> may facilitate the discovery
    of the truth and the adjudication of a case on its merits must therefore be
    weighed against factors pointing to exclusion, in order to “balance the
    interests of truth with the integrity of the justice system”.... [Citation
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Society’s interest in <span class=GramE>an
    adjudication</span> on the merits is seriously undercut where highly reliable and
    important evidence is excluded.  The
    evidence in issue here, particularly the crack cocaine, was entirely reliable
    and essential to the Crown’s case.  The
    charge is also a serious one, although as the majority point out in <i>Grant</i>, at para. 84, the seriousness of
    the charge will “cut both ways” when assessing society’s interest in an
    adjudication on the merits.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having conducted the inquiries mandated by <i>Grant</i>, examined the application of those
    inquiries to non-bodily physical evidence in <i>Grant</i> (paras. 112-115) and its companion case, <i>R. v. Harrison</i> (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 86 (S.C.C.), I would hold
    that the nature of the state conduct and society’s interest in an adjudication
    on the merits militate strongly in favour of admitting the evidence.  The impact on the appellant’s s. 8 rights
    points strongly toward exclusion.  How
    does one balance these directly conflicting assessments?  Without diminishing the important negative
    impact on the appellant’s legitimate privacy interests occasioned by the
    unreasonable search, I find compelling the argument that the exclusion of
    reliable crucial evidence in circumstances where the propriety of the police
    conduct stands unchallenged would, viewed reasonably and from a long-term
    perspective, have a negative effect on the repute of the administration of
    justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent any claim of police misconduct or
    negligence in the obtaining of the initial search warrant, and absent any
    attempt to go behind the redacted information, it would be inappropriate to
    proceed on any basis other than that the police conducted themselves in
    accordance with the applicable legal rules.  If there were a taint of impropriety, or even inattention to
    constitutional standards, to be found in the police conduct, that might well be
    enough to tip the scales in favour of exclusion, given the very deleterious
    effect on the accused’s legitimate privacy interests.  I can see none.  The evidence is admissible under the approach
    to s. 24(2) set out in <i>Grant</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
