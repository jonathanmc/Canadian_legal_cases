  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are limited partners whose involvement in a London
    condominium complex in the late 1980’s went horribly wrong.  The respondent,
    Colonia, who provided the limited partners with loans through a fractured
    mortgage arrangement, is seeking the deficiency remaining after power of sale
    proceedings.  The limited partners claim damages from Colonia for negligent
    misrepresentation and in the alternative, for breach of fiduciary duty; they
    also offer a number of defences to the shortfall action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal focuses on a single incident: a renewal letter, prepared by
    Colonia that was sent by the general partner to the limited partners in 1992
    which implicitly represented that the project, which was the subject of their
    investment, had no property tax arrears.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time the renewal letter was prepared, Colonia was not aware there
    were outstanding property taxes.  However, between the time that letter was
    sent to the general partner, Clanson, and the time the letter was forwarded by
    Clanson to the limited partners, Colonia became aware that the 1991 property
    taxes were outstanding.  During that period Colonia and Clanson entered into a
    forbearance arrangement whereby it was agreed that Clanson would pay the tax
    arrears over a limited time period.  The tax arrears were never paid and by the
    time the limited partners learned of the arrears in 1994 it was too late
    because by then the project was no longer salvageable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed the investors’ claims for negligent
    misrepresentation essentially on the basis that Colonia’s duty of care did not
    include the duty to communicate directly with the limited partners to keep them
    appraised of the property tax arrears and in any event there had been no
    reliance as the limited partners did not understand the renewal agreement as an
    implied statement that there were no tax arrears.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With no suggestion that Colonia was acting on
    behalf of, or would look out for, the interests of the limited partners, the
    imposition of the obligations of a fiduciary is not appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also dismissed the various defences offered by the limited partners
    to the shortfall action concluding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Colonia’s
    failure to collect or monitor the tax payments was not a material alteration of
    the original contract of debt such that their personal covenants were
    discharged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         It
    was not open to the limited partners to argue they were not bound by the
    renewal agreement.  They were primary covenantors by virtue of the mortgage
    assumption agreement, not sureties and they had throughout acted as though the
    loan had been properly renewed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         The
    most logical interpretation of the parties’ interactions and intentions is that
    the loan was renewed with the consent of the limited partners.  For those who
    signed and returned the renewal document, they are bound and for those who did
    not, their consent is inferred as a matter of fact.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         The
    limited partners acted through the general partner who negotiated the renewal
    on their behalf. They could not argue Colonia failed to disclose a material
    fact when their agent was a party to the forbearance agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow we are of the view that the appeal should be
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship between Colonia and the limited partners is a
    contractual one.  That is not to say there cannot be a claim against Colonia in
    tort.  But when consideration is given as to whether a duty of care arises on
    the particular facts, the contractual nature of the relationship cannot be
    ignored.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The limited partners were investors and this investment opportunity was
    not without risk.  The offering memorandum described the securities as
    “speculative” and noted that there was no market for the partnership units. 
    Investors were told they would be largely dependent on the rental manager’s and
    general partner’s good faith and expertise in the operation and management of
    the project as well as on the financial ability of Mountainside generally and
    in particular its provision of the gross rent and operating expense guarantees.
    They were told that neither the general partner nor Mountainside (an affiliate
    of the general partner) had any net worth. As the trial judge noted “This was
    clearly an investment for reasonably sophisticated investors who were prepared
    to risk their investment.”  The offering memorandum clearly stated that each
    limited partner would be required to assume the Colonia mortgage and would
    thereby become personally liable for the mortgage amount associated with his or
    her partnership unit.  As such the limited partner might be required to make
    additional payments if the mortgage went into default.  When the partnership
    unit was purchased, the limited partner would direct the general partner to
    make the Colonia payments, for which the limited partner was liable, from the
    building’s gross rents.  Each limited partner was required to execute a
    mortgage assumption agreement which was a schedule to the offering memorandum.  That
    document caused the limited partners to become personally liable for the
    mortgage debt and adopt all of the mortgagor’s covenants.  Paragraph 4, the
    “principal debtor” clause, emphasized the mortgagee’s right to refrain from
    enforcing its rights without prejudice.  The clause is an important one:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.  The Covenantor hereby covenants, promise and
    agree to and with the Mortgagee as principal debtor and not as surety, to pay
    the Assumed Debt, and to  observe, perform, keep and be bound by every
    covenant, attornment, term, condition and agreement contained in the Mortgages,
    and the Covenantor hereby waives notice of default under the Mortgages. The Covenantor
    further agrees that the Mortgagee may at any time or times and from time to
    time release or discharge any part or parts of the Mortgaged Property or any
    securities now or hereafter held as collateral or otherwise to the Mortgages
    for such consideration as the Mortgagee may see fit, and that the Mortgagee may
    allow the principal moneys[<i>sic</i>] and/or interest or any part or parts
    thereof to be in arrears and may alter, extend or revise in any way whatsoever
    the terms and conditions of repayment, and may refrain from enforcing payment,
    or otherwise deal with the Mortgages, the Covenantor and with the Limited Partnership
    in whatsoever manner as the Mortgagee shall think proper, from time to time
    without the prior approval or knowledge of or notice to the Covenantor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general partners arranged for the Mortgage Assumption Agreement to
    be signed by the limited partners and returned  to Colonia.  Throughout the
    dealings Colonia made it clear that it would deal only with the general partner
    and would not deal directly with the limited partners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colonia was in the commercial mortgage business.  It did not deal in residential
    mortgages. The original take-out financing was a single loan amount which
    covered the entire project. To facilitate the marketing of the project as a
    limited partnership, the developers sought Colonia’s agreement to fracture the
    mortgage into units which would correspond to the partnership units which were
    associated with one or two specific condominium units.  Colonia agreed to
    fracture the mortgage but only on the conditions set out in their letter dated
    May 2, 1988 to Colbourne York Limited Partnership including:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.         Colbourne
    York Limited Partnership is to provide for the ongoing administration of these
    individual mortgage loans in collecting all monthly payments from individual
    unit owners. Colbourne York Limited Partnership will then submit one monthly
    payment cheque to Colonia, which cheque will be submitted to Colonia in the
    form of a series of twelve post-dated cheques.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Should
    any or all of the individual loans go into default, requiring Colonia to then
    collect all or any individual payments, there shall be a two percent annual
    administration fee charged and payable monthly to Colonia.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The partnership was to be responsible for all costs associated with the
    fracturing of the mortgage and pay Colonia an administration fee of $14,700.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be no doubt that the arrangements, clearly understood by all,
    were that Colonia would deal only with the general partner in relation to the
    mortgage debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We turn now to the critical document, the renewal offer. The renewal
    offer, dated June 16, 1992 is addressed to Krystal Holdings Inc. (for Colbourne
    York Limited Partnership).  The offer to renew stated that it was “subject to
    the terms and conditions set out in the original commitment letter dated April
    30, 1987 and the amending agreement dated May 2, 1988.” and to CMHC approval. 
    The renewal also provided that each limited partner provide Colonia with a
    signed consent to the renewal and an acknowledgement of his or her
    proportionate share of the outstanding principal. It is agreed that both CMHC
    and Colonia underwriting requirements did not permit arrears of property tax.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between the times the renewal letter was sent to the general partner and
    June 26, 1992 – Colonia became aware that the 1991 property taxes had not been
    paid.  After discussion Colonia entered into a forbearance agreement with the
    general partner whereby it would continue with the renewal on the understanding
    that the 91 taxes would be brought current within 12 to 18  months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general partner sent Colonia’s renewal letter to the limited
    partners but not the subsequent letter of June 25, 1992 which evidences the
    forbearance arrangement in relation to the outstanding property taxes.  The
    limited partners were asked to sign and return the letters and to address any
    questions in relation to the renewal to the author of the letter under the
    heading Financial Information the letter stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The building has been operating in a deficit
    position due to the inability to increase rents as originally projected. The
    recession and the current problems facing the real estate market in general
    have been major factors influencing the lack of any rental increase in your
    building.  As mentioned in previous correspondence, half of the $500,000 letter
    of credit, held by the Registrar and Transfer Agent, was used to cover
    shortfalls in 1991.  It is expected that the remaining amount will be used to
    cover shortfalls occurring in 1992.  The General Partner has agreed to fund the
    deficit on the building (approximately $10,000 per month) until the end of
    1993.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, Colonia was entitled to assume that the General Partner
    would pass all relevant information on to the limited partners.  Throughout
    their dealings Colonia had only ever dealt directly with the general partner;
    it had no direct dealings with the limited partners. It’s agreement to fracture
    the mortgage was conditional on the general partner undertaking all of the
    necessary administration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, Colonia had no obligation to communicate
    directly with the limited partners; all of their correspondence went to the
    general partner and there was no reason to assume then, that the relevant
    information was not being passed along.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hercules Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i> (1997), 2 S.C.R.165
    LaForest J. noted at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The first branch of the Anns/Kamloops
    test demands an inquiry into whether there is a sufficiently close relationship
    between the plaintiff and the defendant that in the reasonable contemplation of
    the latter, carelessness on its part may cause damage to the former. The
    existence of such a relationship – which has come to be known as a relationship
    of “neighbourhood” or “proximity” – distinguishes those circumstances in which
    the defendant owes a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care to the plaintiff from
    those where no such duty exists. In the context of a negligent
    misrepresentation action, then, deciding whether or not a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care exists necessitates an investigation into whether the
    defendant-representator and the plaintiff-representee can be said to be in a
    relationship of proximity or neighbourhood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here Colonia and the limited partners relationship is defined between
    the contracts between them and the general partner. Absent the contracts they
    are strangers in law. The limited partners granted mortgages as security to
    Colonia for the loans advanced by Colonia to financially facilitate the limited
    partners’ acquisition of their partnership units. In consenting to fracture the
    original mortgage Colonia made it clear that the administration in relation to
    the 147 fractured mortgages was for the general partner and not Colonia. Indeed
    the record discloses that when, on one occasion, the general partner requested
    of Colonia that it provide certain information to the individual limited
    partners, Colonia refused to do so. In fact, Colonia never communicated with
    the limited partners for any reason. The mortgage assumption agreements that
    the limited partners signed were sent by Colonia to the general partner for
    execution and return. There can be no doubt on this record that the only party
    the limited partners relied on in relation to the Colonia mortgages was the
    general partner. There was no reason for Colonia to have the limited partners
    in its contemplation when it had specifically refused to have any relationship
    with them. Colonia’s relationship of proximity was with the general partner and
    on this record the general partner was in full possession of all the facts long
    before the loan was ever renewed- it just did not pass the information along to
    the limited partners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their letter of renewal which by implication suggested there were no
    property tax arrears was sent to the general partner as was their subsequent
    letter after they learned about the outstanding taxes.  What has been
    characterized as the “misrepresentation” in the renewal letter was corrected by
    the letter which followed 10 days later and over a month before the mortgage
    came due.  As stated above at the time the renewal letter was sent Colonia did
    not know the 91 taxes had not been paid; they did not knowingly misrepresent
    anything.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances and particularly in view of the nature of the
    contractual arrangements among the parties and their interactions one with the
    other, we are of the view that no duty of care was owed by Colonia to the limited
    partners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further the evidence of Mr. Pyle, the expert lender, was that he would
    not have communicated with the limited partners  directly in the circumstances
    which prevailed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Pyle also opined about “correcting the misrepresentation”.  While
    Colonia’s Mr. Harper was of the view that to correct the “misrepresentation” it
    would be necessary to inform the limited partners that there were outstanding
    tax arrears, Mr. Pyle took a different view.  As the trial judge noted at para.
    147 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The appropriate question for the standard of care,
    then, is whether the standard of care required Colonia to inform the limited  partners
     of  the  Forbearance  Agreement.   Mr. Pyle stated that he would have expected the general
    partner to send the forbearance letter to the limited partners.  In his view,
    it was not the lender’s role to communicate information that was available within
     the  partnership.  He  repeatedly,   stated that he would not have
    communicated directly with the limited partners. He particularly noted that he
    would not have sent such a letter to them directly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And after noting that industry standards are instructive but not
    determinative of the standard of care he went on at para. 149:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Pyle’s opinion is not determinative by itself
    of the standard of care but is of significance.  Given the way that this
    transaction was structured and the history of the interactions between the
    parties, I have concluded that the requisite standard of care did not require
    Colonia to circulate the forbearance letter to the limited partners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that Colonia did not owe any
    duty to the limited partners to “correct” what later turned out to be
    misinformation in the renewal letter. In all the circumstances and on the particular
    facts of this case it was reasonable for Colonia to assume all relevant
    information would be passed from the general partner with whom it dealt, to the
    limited partners including of course the forbearance letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly the claim for breach of fiduciary duty must fail where there
    is no duty owed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><u>Defences to the Shortfall Claims</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those defences and the trial judge’s conclusions in respect thereto are
    set out above in paragraph six. We agree with the trial judge and would add
    only that clause four of the mortgage assumption agreement gives to Colonia
    broad powers to deal with the mortgage “..without prior approval or knowledge
    of or notice to the Covenantor…”</p>
