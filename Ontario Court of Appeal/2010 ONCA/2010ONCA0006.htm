  <h2>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 69(1)(d) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8
    (the “Act”), authorizes the Superintendent of Financial Services (the
    “Superintendent”)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    in the exercise of his or her discretion, to order a partial or full wind-up of
    a pension plan where “a significant number of members of the pension plan”
    cease to be employed by an employer as a result of the “discontinuance” or
    “reorganization” of the employer’s business.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under existing authorities, the significance inquiry under s. 69(1)(d)
    of the Act traditionally has been conducted on one or both of two bases: (i) by
    comparing the number of pension plan members whose employment has been
    terminated as a result of a business reorganization or discontinuance with the
    number of active members of the plan as a whole; or (ii) by considering the
    number of terminated plan members on an absolute, non-comparative basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue on this appeal is whether s. 69(1)(d) of the Act also
    permits the conduct of a significance inquiry on a third basis, namely, by
    comparing the number of terminated plan members falling within a defined subset
    of plan members with the total number of active plan members in that subset (a
    “subset analysis”).  This interpretive question is a matter of first impression
    for this court.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three subsidiary issues also arise: (i) what standard applies to review
    of a decision by the Financial Services Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) to compel the
    partial wind-up of a pension plan? (ii) did the Divisional Court err by holding
    that the Tribunal’s decision on significance under s. 69(1)(d), based on a
    subset analysis, was reasonable in the circumstances of this case? and (iii) is
    the existence of a collective agreement in the affected workplace a proper
    consideration under s. 69(1)(d) when deciding whether to order the partial
    wind-up of a pension plan?</p>
  <h2>II.        Relevant Statutory Provisions</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The full text of the pertinent statutory provisions is set out in
    Appendix “A” to these reasons.  Section 69(1)(d) of the Act reads as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>69.(1) The Superintendent by order may require the
    wind up of a pension plan in whole or in part if,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(d)
    a significant number of members of the pension plan cease to be employed by
    the employer as a result of the discontinuance of all or part of the business
    of the employer or as a result of the re-organization of the business of the
    employer; </p>
  <h2>III.      Facts </h2>
  <h2>            (1)       Terminations</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002, the appellant Hydro One
    Inc.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>(“Hydro One”)<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> implemented four business initiatives that resulted in various workers leaving
    the employ of the company.  One of these initiatives, effected in late 2002,
    involved the merger of two former Hydro One affiliate corporations (the
    “Merger”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although about 3,700 Hydro One employees were affected by the Merger, only
    126 employees lost their jobs as a result of it.  Specifically, Hydro One
    terminated the employment of 73 Management Compensation Plan (“MCP”) employees
    – including that of the individual respondents, Chris Marino (“Marino”) and
    Karen Jones (“Jones”) – (the “Affected MCP Employees”).  As well, 53 employees
    represented by the respondent, the Society of Energy Professionals (the
    “Society”), left their employ with Hydro One under voluntary severance programs
    negotiated between Hydro One and the Society (the “Affected Society Employees”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the Merger, Hydro One sponsored a single defined benefit
    pension plan for all unionized and non-unionized regular employees (the
    “Plan”).  As of December 31, 2002, there were 3,913 active members of the Plan,
    about 90% of whom were represented by the two respondent unions: the Society
    and the Power Workers’ Union (the “PWU”).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> 
    The breakdown of Plan members was as follows: 379 MCP employees; 773 Society employees;
    and 2,761 PWU employees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan formed part of the collective agreements between Hydro One and
    the respondent unions.  MCP employees were not members of either union and,
    hence, were not covered by the collective agreements.  However, the Plan made
    no material distinction among MCP, Society and PWU employees.  Consequently, any
    enhancements to the Plan negotiated by either union benefited all members of
    the Plan, including MCP employees.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On termination of their employment with Hydro One, none of the Affected
    MCP and Society Employees received any pension enhancements.  The Affected
    Society Employees, however, received severance packages negotiated during the
    collective bargaining process.  The record before this court does not reveal the
    nature of any statutory or common law severance arrangements put in place for
    the Affected MCP Employees on the involuntary terminations of their employment.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Superintendent’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the Merger, Marino and Jones, acting on their own behalf and on
    behalf of other Affected MCP Employees, applied to the Superintendent for a
    partial wind-up of the Plan under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) of the Act.  They argued
    that Hydro One’s four business initiatives during the three-year period ending
    December 31, 2002 constituted a single “reorganization” of Hydro One’s business,
    which resulted in the cessation of employment of “a significant number of
    members of the [Plan]” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;69(1)(d).   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent disagreed.  In his view, the four business initiatives
    in question did not constitute a single reorganization of Hydro One’s business. 
    Moreover, while some of the initiatives, viewed individually, involved a reorganization
    of Hydro One’s business, none of them warranted a partial wind-up of the Plan.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent explicitly rejected the claim that the Merger should
    trigger a partial wind-up of the Plan.  He held that, while the Merger
    constituted a “reorganization” under s. 69(1)(d), the 126 Plan members whose
    employment was terminated as a result of the Merger was not significant “in the
    context of an active Plan membership of approximately 4,000”.  Accordingly, by
    notice of proposal dated July 14, 2005, the Superintendent proposed to decline the
    request for a partial wind-up order.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Tribunal’s Ruling</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marino and Jones requested a hearing before the Tribunal concerning the
    Super-intendent’s decision.  The Tribunal agreed with the Superintendent that
    Hydro One’s four business initiatives were not related and that the Merger was
    a “reorganization” within the meaning of s. 69(1)(d).  The Tribunal also ruled that
    the total number of Plan members who ceased to be employed as a result of the
    Merger (126 members) was not a significant number, either in absolute terms or
    as a percentage of the total active Plan membership.  These findings are not
    disputed on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Tribunal also undertook a subset analysis to further
    evaluate the significance of the number of Plan members whose employment ceased
    as a result of the Merger.  In the Tribunal’s view, this interpretive approach
    was permitted by s. 69(1)(d) of the Act in an appropriate case, although the
    circumstances in which it should be undertaken “may be rare”.  In particular, the
    Tribunal held that it is permissible in such cases “to segregate a category of
    employees from the total membership of a plan, and judge the significance of
    the number of employees within the segregated category who have ceased to be
    employed … by comparing that number to the total number of members in that category”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The subset analysis conducted by the Tribunal in this case involved a
    comparison of the number of Affected MCP Employees (73) with the total number
    of MCP employees who were active members of the Plan at the time of the Merger
    (379).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal found that the MCP employees, who were “unprotected by …
    collective agreements”, constituted about 10% of the total active Plan
    membership.  In contrast, the Affected MCP Employees represented less than 2%
    of the total number of active Plan members.  However, the Affected MCP
    Employees also represented approximately 18% of all active MCP members of the
    Plan.  In the Tribunal’s opinion, had the entire group of MCP employees enjoyed
    a pension plan of its own, 18 per cent (18%) would be “well within the range of
    terminations considered ‘significant’, on the existing authorities”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this basis, the Tribunal concluded that the number of Affected MCP
    Employees was significant under s. 69(1)(d) of the Act.  The Tribunal,
    therefore, directed the Superintendent to order a partial wind-up of the Plan
    regarding those Affected MCP Employees whose employment was terminated between
    September 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal reached a different conclusion concerning the Affected Society
    Employees for two reasons.  First, the Tribunal held that the number of
    Affected Society Employees (53) did not represent a significant number of
    members of the Plan whether compared with the total active Plan membership
    (3,913), with the total number of Society employees who were active Plan members
    at the time of the Merger (773), or considered in absolute terms.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in the Tribunal’s view, deference to the collective bargaining
    process dictated that the Affected Society Employees should be excluded from
    the directed partial Plan wind-up.  The Tribunal held that, once it was
    determined that the threshold for a wind-up order under s. 69(1)(d) had been
    met, the collective agreement between the Society and Hydro One was a relevant
    factor to be considered when deciding whether to order a partial Plan wind-up. 
    Unlike the circumstances pertaining to the Affected MCP Employees, Society representatives
    had determined and negotiated a bargain that, at the time it was struck, was
    “in the best interest of [the Society employees]”.  Consequently, the bargain
    negotiated should remain “inviolate”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hydro One appealed to the Divisional Court.  The Affected Society
    Employees did not appeal.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Divisional Court’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court ruled that the standard of correctness applies to review
    of the Tribunal’s interpretation of s. 69(1)(d) of the Act, while the
    Tribunal’s application of s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) to the facts of this case is reviewable
    on the reasonableness standard.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying those standards, the Divisional Court held that the Tribunal’s
    conclusion that s. 69(1)(d) permitted a significance inquiry based on a subset
    analysis was “correct in law” and “consistent with the context in which s. 69
    appears, the language employed by the Legislature, and the scheme and purpose
    of the [Act]”.  The Divisional Court further ruled that the Tribunal’s application
    of the Act to the facts of this case and its consideration of Hydro One’s
    collective agreement with the Society were reasonable.  Accordingly, the
    Divisional Court dismissed Hydro One’s appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hydro One again appeals.  </p>
  <h2>IV.      Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As framed by the parties, there are four issues:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court err in its determination of the standards for

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)<span

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court err by holding that the Tribunal’s decision to

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[26]<span

  <h2>V.        Analysis</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       Standards of Review</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Divisional Court that the standard applicable to review
    of the Tribunal’s interpretation of s. 69(1)(d) of the Act is that of
    correctness.  I also agree that the reasonableness standard governs review of
    the Tribunal’s application of s. 69(1)(d) to the particular facts of this
    case.  I reach these conclusions for the following reasons.</p>
  <h2>(i)        Proper Standard on the </h2>
  <h2>                                    Statutory
    Interpretation Issue</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court’s ruling concerning the proper standard on the
    statutory interpretation issue was based on the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Monsanto
    Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services)</i>, [2004] 3
    S.C.R. 152, and the Divisional Court’s own review of the various factors permitting
    identification of the proper standard of review.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Monsanto</i>, the Supreme Court held that the correctness standard
    governed review of the Tribunal’s interpretation of s. 70(6) of the Act, a
    provision dealing with the rights and benefits accruing to pension plan members
    on a partial wind-up of a pension plan.  Based on the standard of review
    analysis then applicable under its jurisprudence – the “pragmatic and
    functional test” – the Supreme Court reasoned that all the factors permitting identification
    of the standard of review supported the conclusion that the correctness
    standard applied to the Tribunal’s interpretation of s. 70(6).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Monsanto</i> pre-dated by four years the Supreme Court’s landmark
    decision in <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, which
    revisited the framework for determining standard of review.  <i>Dunsmuir</i> establishes a two-step standard of review process.  Justices Bastarache and LeBel,
    writing for a majority of the court, explained this process at para. 62:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>First, courts ascertain whether the jurisprudence
    has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be
    accorded with regard to a particular category of question.  Second, where the
    first inquiry proves unfruitful, courts must proceed to an analysis of the
    factors making it possible to identify the proper standard of review.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 64 of their reasons, Bastarache and LeBel JJ. elaborated on the
    second step of this process:   </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The analysis must be contextual.  As mentioned
    above, it is dependent on the application of a number of relevant factors,
    including: (1) the presence or absence of a privative clause; (2) the purpose
    of the tribunal as determined by interpretation of enabling legislation; (3)
    the nature of the question at issue; and (4) the expertise of the tribunal.  In
    many cases, it will not be necessary to consider all of the factors, as some of
    them may be determinative in the application of the reasonableness standard in
    a specific case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court expressly considered these factors in <i>Monsanto</i>,
    indicating as follows at pp. 159-161:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>no statutory privative clause insulates the Tribunal’s decisions from
    judicial review.  On the contrary, s.&nbsp;91(1) of the Act provides for a
    statutory right of appeal to the Divisional Court;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the question at issue in <i>Monsanto</i> was a pure question of law, as
    it related to the interpretation of a statutory provision that has no
    specialized technical meaning;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in respect of such an interpretive issue: “[T]he Tribunal does not have
    specific expertise … the nature of the Tribunal’s expertise is primarily
    adjudicative.”   Further, “[T]here is little to indicate that the legislature
    intended to create a body with particular expertise over the statutory
    interpretation of the Act”; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>nothing related to the purpose of the Act as a whole, or s. 70(6) in
    particular, evidenced a requirement of deference to the Tribunal’s
    interpretation of s. 70(6).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This reasoning is apposite in the present case with respect to the
    statutory interpretation issue.  In particular, in my opinion, the
    interpretation of s. 69(1)(d) of the Act involves a general question of law “that
    is both of central importance to the legal system as a whole and outside [the
    Tribunal’s] specialized area of expertise” so as to attract the correctness
    standard of review: <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at para. 60.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that not all questions of law attract the correctness
    standard: see <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at paras. 55-56; <i>Flora v. Ontario (Health
    Insurance Plan, General Manager)</i> (2008), 295 D.L.R. (4th) 309, at para.
    41.  This important principle was reiterated recently in <i>Nolan v. Kerry
    (Canada) Inc.</i> (2009), 309 D.L.R. (4th) 513.  As in <i>Monsanto</i>, <i>Nolan</i> involved a standard of review analysis relating to a Tribunal decision.  The
    questions at issue in <i>Nolan</i> were largely questions of law concerning the
    Tribunal’s interpretation of pension plans, related texts and the Tribunal’s own
    enabling statute, the FSCO Act.  In respect of these types of questions, where
    the Tribunal does have expertise “being both close to the industry and more
    familiar with the administrative scheme of pension law”, <i>Nolan</i> holds that
    the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness: paras. 29 and 31-35.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not this case.  In contrast to <i>Nolan</i>, the key question on
    this appeal concerns the Tribunal’s interpretation of a provision of the Act, <i>not</i> the interpretation of pension plans and the Tribunal’s ‘home’ statute.  I do
    not read <i>Nolan</i> as deviating from <i>Monsanto</i>’s holding that the
    correctness standard applies to the type of interpretive question engaged in
    the present case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Monsanto</i> establishes the degree of deference to be accorded to
    the Tribunal on pure questions of law or statutory interpretation involving the
    Act.  That standard is one of correctness.  Thus, it is unnecessary to consider
    the second step of the <i>Dunsmuir</i> standard of review analysis in
    connection with the statutory interpretation issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I also observe that my holding on this issue would be the
    same under the second step of the standard of review analysis, as the factors
    permitting identification of the applicable standard of review were expressly
    considered in <i>Monsanto</i> and led, as I have indicated, to the conclusion
    that the correctness standard applies to review of the Tribunal’s
    interpretation of a provision of the Act.  </p>
  <h2>(ii)       Proper Standard on the</h2>
  <h2>                                    Statutory
    Application Issue</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In ruling that the reasonableness standard applies to review of the
    Tribunal’s application of the Act in this case, the Divisional Court stated at
    para. 29:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A second question is the application of the statute
    to the facts.  This requires the Tribunal to exercise its discretion whether to
    order a partial wind-up.  In that context, the Tribunal does have expertise and
    consequently the decision attracts deference.  We are of the view that the
    standard of review on this aspect is reasonableness.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>I agree for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, I observe that <i>Monsanto</i> is not dispositive of the
    issue of the proper standard for review of the Tribunal’s decision to order a
    partial wind-up of the Plan.  <i>Monsanto</i> was concerned with the Tribunal’s
    interpretation, rather than its application, of a specific provision of the
    Act.  Nor, in my view, does any other authority definitively determine the
    applicable standard on this question.  Accordingly, on the statutory
    application issue, it is necessary to consider the second step of the <i>Dunsmuir</i> standard of review process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, I regard the following factors as controlling.  First, where,
    as here, a hearing by the Tribunal is conducted regarding a proposal by the
    Superintendent to decline a request for a partial wind-up of a pension plan, s.
    89(9) of the Act comes into play.  That provision states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At or after the hearing, the Tribunal by order may
    direct the Superintendent to carry out or to refrain from carrying out the
    proposal and to take such action as the Tribunal considers the Superintendent
    ought to take in accordance with this Act and the regulations, and for such
    purposes, the Tribunal may substitute its opinion for that of the
    Superintendent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Tribunal enjoys wide discretionary power under s. 89(9) to
    substitute its opinion for that of the Superintendent and to direct the
    Superintendent to act as the Tribunal considers appropriate in accordance with
    the Act: <i>Nolan</i>, at paras. 27 and 35.   Questions of discretion generally
    attract a standard of reasonableness and deference will usually apply
    automatically: <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at paras. 51 and 53.  This suggests that
    deference is owed to the Tribunal on the question of whether to direct the
    Superintendent to order a partial wind-up under s. 69(1)(d) of the Act.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, unlike its specialized predecessor agency – the Pension Commission
    of Ontario – the Tribunal is a multidisciplinary body whose members are not
    obliged to have any specific expertise in pensions.  The FSCO Act does not require
    that members appointed to the Tribunal and assigned to a pension-related
    hearing have special expertise in pension matters: <i>Monsanto</i>, at p. 161;
    FSCO Act, ss. 6(4) and 7(2).  Moreover, in contrast to the former Commission, the
    Tribunal has no policy functions as part of its pension mandate that might
    attract deference to a Tribunal decision requiring a pension plan wind-up. 
    Rather, the Tribunal serves an adjudicative function within Ontario’s pension
    regulation scheme: <i>Monsanto</i>, at p. 161; <i>Nolan</i>, at para. 27; <i>BICC
    Cables Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services)</i> (2001),
    147 O.A.C. 252 (Div. Ct.), at paras. 11-12.  The policy function that was
    previously assigned to the Pension Commission of Ontario has been inherited by
    the Superintendent under the Act.  These factors suggest that less deference is
    owed to a Tribunal decision compelling a pension plan wind-up.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet, the decision whether to require the partial wind-up of a pension
    plan is fundamentally different from a question of statutory interpretation
    concerning the circumstances in which the remedy of a partial wind-up may be
    legally available.  Because it works frequently with the implementation of the
    Act and is more familiar than the courts with the administrative scheme of
    pension law (see <i>Nolan</i>, at para. 29), I accept that the Tribunal possesses
    some expertise on discretionary matters relating to the application of the Act
    and that it has developed some measure of expertise regarding the multi-faceted
    implications of a wind-up.  That this was recognized by the legislature, at
    least implicitly, is confirmed by the expansive ambit of the Tribunal’s authority
    under s.&nbsp;89(9) of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the question of whether to order a partial or full wind-up of
    a pension plan involves the “balancing of multiple sets of interests of
    competing constituencies”: see <i>Monsanto</i>, at p. 162.  Unlike the issue in <i>Monsanto</i>, which concerned a purely legal question that was “neither
    factually laden nor highly technical”, it is also a fact-driven and
    case-specific inquiry: <i>Monsanto</i>, at p. 160.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, these considerations tilt the balance in favour of the
    deferential standard of reasonableness on the statutory application issue.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Statutory Interpretation Issue </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal’s use of a subset analysis in its s. 69(1)(d) significance
    inquiry derived from comments by a differently constituted panel of the
    Tribunal in <i>London Life Insurance Co. v. Ontario (Superintendent of
    Financial Services)</i> (2001), 26 C.C.P.B. 249 (FSCO).  In that case, relying
    on <i>Stelco Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Pensions)</i>, PCO Bulletin,
    vol. 4, issue 1 (July 7, 1993), aff’d (1994), 115 D.L.R. (4th) 437 (Ont. Div.
    Ct.), varied (1994), 126 D.L.R. (4th) 767 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused,
    [1995] S.C.C.A. No. 481, the Tribunal determined the significance of the number
    of employment terminations caused by a business reorganization on the basis of
    the absolute number of terminations, without regard to the total membership of
    the applicable pension plan.  However, the Tribunal also said, at pp. 254-55:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]e have also considered the question of whether
    the number of involuntary terminations as a result of the reorganization is
    “significant” in relation to the membership of the Plan.  In this case, the
    significance of the number 384 may be properly assessed <i>by comparing that
    number to the total number of active members of the Plan who were
    administrative employees at the relevant time</i>. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center;'>.…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>If we take the number of Plan members who, it is
    agreed, ceased to be employed as a result of the reorganization, namely 384, as
    a percentage of this possible range of total active Plan members who were
    administrative staff at the relevant time</i>, we come up with percentages
    ranging between 14.9 and 12.8.  In our opinion, 384 is a “significant number”
    of employees ceasing to be employed in the course of a year as a result of a
    reorganization when that number represents a percentage, of the relevant base
    of Plan members, that comes anywhere within this range, i.e. even if it is as
    low as 12.8%.  <i>This proportional analysis reinforces our earlier conclusion
    based on the absolute number of terminations resulting from the reorganization
    that the number of terminations was “significant” in this case</i>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal in the present case considered these <i>obiter</i> comments
    and stated: “We believe that this is an appropriate case to further consider
    the cautious suggestion in <i>London Life</i> that significance might be
    determined by reference to some sub-group within a plan.”  The Tribunal went on
    to conclude that a subset analysis is permissible under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) in
    “appropriate” but “rare” circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal considered several factors,
    including: (i) the size of the entire group of MCP employees who were members
    of the Plan, in relation to the total Plan membership; (ii) the fact that MCP
    employees were not protected in the workforce by collective agreements; (iii)
    the percentage that the Affected MCP Employees represented of the entire group
    of MCP employees; (iv) the language of s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) of the Act, including,
    especially, the use of the word “significant” in that provision; (v) the
    direction afforded by <i>Monsanto</i> regarding the protective purpose and
    remedial nature of the Act; and (vi) finally, the complexity of and variation in
    modern private sector pension plans.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given these factors, the Tribunal concluded, “this is an appropriate
    case to segregate the MCP employees from other plan members” and held that the
    Affected MCP Employees “constituted a significant number of members of the
    pension plan for the purpose of applying s. 69(1)(d) of the [Act]”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conclusions of the Divisional Court on this issue were succinctly summarized
    at paragraphs 52-53 of its reasons:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>From these cases we conclude the following.  The
    number of terminated employees can be significant as an absolute number.  It is
    not necessary to introduce proportions to the analysis, although it is
    sometimes done.  When proportions are considered, the numerator might be the
    number of terminated employees and the denominator might be the total number of
    active members in the plan; or <i>the numerator might be the number of
    terminated employees in a subset and the denominator might be the total number
    of members in that subset.  Those examples are not exhaustive</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Based on the decisions in those cases, on the
    ordinary and grammatical sense of the words, on the legislative history and the
    scheme and purpose of the <i>Act</i>, we do not agree with Hydro One’s
    assertion that the words “significant number” must be determined by comparing
    the number of affected Pension Plan members against the total active plan
    membership (i.e. 73/3913).  The jurisprudence has moved from this historical
    approach to finding that the threshold of s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) can be met simply by
    considering the absolute number of terminated employees without looking to the
    ratio.  <i>Indeed, the numerator may be the number of terminated employees in a
    subset and the denominator may be the total number of members in that subset in
    appropriate circumstances</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>Thus, in the Divisional Court’s opinion, the Tribunal’s
    interpretation of s. 69(1)(d) was correct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I agree that a significance inquiry under
    s. 69(1)(d) of the Act may be based on a subset analysis.  In my opinion, both
    the wording of s. 69(1)(d) itself and the overall scheme and purpose of the
    legislative framework compel this interpretive conclusion.  However, as I will
    also explain, despite the availability of a subset analysis under s. 69(1)(d),
    resort to this type of analysis will not be reasonable in every case.</p>
  <h2>(i)        Wording of s.
    69(1)(d)</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper approach to statutory interpretation requires that the words
    in question be “read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
    ordinary sense”, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the legislation and
    the intention of the legislature: see e.g.,<i> Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd</i>.<i> (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21;<i> Bell ExpressVu Limited
    Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the words in question are “a significant number of members
    of the pension plan”, as they appear in s. 69(1)(d).  Because the relevant
    number of members is concerned with members “of the pension plan”, the
    grammatical and ordinary sense of the entire phrase “a significant number of
    members of the pension plan” suggests that regard must be had to the plan as a
    whole.  But the matter does not end there.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first important word of the phrase at issue, the word “significant”,
    is not defined under the Act and, apart from s. 69(1), does not otherwise
    appear in the Act.  As used in s. 69(1)(d), the word “significant”  modifies
    the phrase “number of members of the pension plan” who cease to be employed by
    the employer.  Under s. 1(1) of the Act, the word “member” is defined as “a
    member of the pension plan”, while the phrase “former member” is defined in
    part to mean “a person who has terminated employment or membership in a pension
    plan”.  The parties accept that by virtue of these definitions, the relevant
    inquiry under s. 69(1)(d) is whether the number of terminated <i>active</i> pension
    plan members is “significant”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No other words of limitation constrain the meaning of “significant” in
    s. 69(1)(d).  In particular, no reference is made in s. 69(1)(d) to any fixed
    formula or approach for the assessment of significance.  For example, the
    provision fails to stipulate any percentage of the workforce or number of
    terminations as a minimum threshold to establish a “significant number of
    members of the pension plan”.  Nor are any other criteria for establishing such
    a threshold set out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from s. 69(1)(d), the statutory grounds for a wind-up order contemplate
    a significance inquiry in three other instances.  Section 69(1)(e) refers to
    the discontinuance of “all or a significant portion” of the employer’s business,
    while ss. 69(1)(h)(i) and (ii) refer to “a significant reduction” in the number
    of members and in contributions, in the context of a multi-employer pension
    plan.  As with s. 69(1)(d), no words of limitation or explanatory language
    regarding the meaning of “significant” appear in these provisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court began its analysis of the Tribunal’s interpretation
    of s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) with consideration of the legislative history of that
    provision.  The court noted that, prior to 1987, the predecessor version of s.
    69(1)(d) referred to a “substantial number”, rather than a “significant number”,
    of pension plan members.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> 
    The Divisional Court emphasized this change in statutory language, observing at
    para. 36: “[T]he word ‘substantial’ connotes weight or size, while the word
    ‘significant’ connotes import.”  At paras. 38-39 of its reasons, the court went
    on to say: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We agree with counsel for the Superintendent that
    words such as “substantial” and “significant” were used to allow for
    flexibility in determining whether a partial wind up should be ordered.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Furthermore, we infer from the change from
    “substantial” to “significant” and to the lack of precision in defining
    “significant”, that the Legislature intended to afford to Tribunals the
    opportunity to make a decision that responds to the uniqueness of each
    situation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the word “significant” does not lend itself to precise
    definition: see <i>Stelco</i> (Ont. Div. Ct.), at p. 110.  I also agree that
    the change in language from “substantial” to “significant” denotes a shift from
    purely quantitative to qualitative considerations.  However, I am not persuaded
    that the nuanced difference in meaning between “substantial” and “significant”
    is of any great moment in interpreting s. 69(1)(d).  Both words essentially
    connote importance or materiality.  This is reinforced by the French language
    version of s. 69(1)(d), which refers to “<i>un nombre important</i> <i>de
    participants</i>”.  Similar references to “<i>importante</i>” are contained in
    the French language text of ss.&nbsp;69(1)(e) and 69(1)(h)(i) and (ii).<a

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, in accordance with normal rules of statutory interpretation,
    the legislature’s use of the term “significant” must be viewed as deliberate. 
    The fact that the term “significant” is inherently imprecise, and that its
    meaning under s. 69(1)(d) is almost entirely unqualified, is a strong
    indication of a legislative intent that the significance inquiry mandated by s.
    69(1)(d) be a flexible and context-specific assessment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in my view, it is precisely because there is considerable
    variability in the structure and scope of pension plans, and in the types of
    business reorganizations that may impact on the security of employee pension
    benefits, that the importance of the number of employee terminations caused by
    a reorganization cannot always be uniformly evaluated.  The use of the somewhat
    elastic term “significant” in s. 69(1)(d) seems designed to ensure that the
    Superintendent has considerable latitude to assess the materiality of the
    number of employee terminations, having regard to the full circumstances
    surrounding the reorganization and the pension plan at issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal made essentially the same point:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]e are also aware that pension plans may now be
    very complex with respect to the employees they protect.  They may range from
    plans covering a single employer with a relatively homogenous work force to
    plans covering multiple operating subsidiaries of a holding company.  They may
    cover, as in this case, management and non-management, or union and non-union
    employees.  They may cover members belonging to more than one union, and those
    unions may not be <i>ad idem</i> in their approach to the pension
    considerations at issue in the face of forthcoming lay-offs.  We conclude that
    the legislative intent of [s. 69(1)(d)] is best furthered by equipping the
    Superintendent with a scalpel, rather than restricting her or him to a blunt
    instrument.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hydro One Group emphasizes that, unlike some other provisions of the
    Act (for example, ss. 31 and 33), s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) makes no mention of
    employees or members of a “class of employees” or of any “classes of persons”.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> 
    Given this omission, the Hydro One Group argues that the legislature should not
    be taken as having intended that a significance inquiry under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) be
    based on a subset analysis, which, by definition, focuses on a particular
    category, class or group of plan members.  The Tribunal rejected this argument
    on the ground that s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) also makes no reference to the “total
    active membership of the pension plan”, a key comparator under the historical approach
    to the evaluation of significance under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the absence in s. 69(1)(d) of explicit reference to any
    category, class or group of employees, pension plan members or persons does not
    preclude resort to a subset analysis for the determination of the significance
    of the number of terminated pension plan members.  As the Tribunal noted, just as
    it was open to the legislature to include such a reference so, too, was the
    legislature free to refer explicitly in s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) to the total overall
    plan membership.  It did neither, instead electing to use the expansive word
    “significant”, a term that necessarily derives its meaning from the context in
    which it is used.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, nothing in the plain language of s. 69(1)(d) precludes the use
    of a subset analysis.  On the contrary, the absence of words of limitation in
    s. 69(1)(d) and the legislature’s choice of the word “significant” suggest that
    a contextual and case-specific approach to the determination of significance is
    required, based on the particular circumstances of each case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Stelco</i>, this court accepted an interpretation of s. 69(1)(d)
    that allowed for significance to be assessed, not on the basis of a comparison
    of the number of member terminations with the total plan membership, but on consideration
    of the absolute number of terminations.  I agree with Marino’s and Jones’
    submission that this reflects reluctance to impose a particular or precise
    meaning on the word “significant” in the context of s. 69(1)(d).  And in <i>Stelco</i>,
    this court upheld a decision of the Pension Commission of Ontario rejecting the
    argument that significance under s. 69(1)(d) requires the number of terminated
    pension plan members to equal a set minimum percentage of the total plan
    membership.  This, too, suggests that a fixed approach to the determination of
    significance under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) is to be avoided.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[66]<span

    69(1)(d) in particular, are best fostered by an interpretation of s. 69(1)(d)
    that allows for flexibility in the means chosen to determine significance under
    that provision, based on the context in which the significance inquiry arises.

  <h2><i>(b)<span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 69(1) of the Act authorizes the Superintendent to intervene in
    respect of a private pension plan in specific circumstances, each of which
    involves a serious event regarding the employer, the employer’s business, or
    the pension plan sponsored by the employer that jeopardizes the availability of
    retirement pension benefits.  For example, the Superintendent’s power under s.
    69(1) is triggered on the cessation or suspension of required plan
    contributions (ss. 69(1)(a) and (b)); on the bankruptcy of the employer (s.&nbsp;69(1)(c));
    on the discontinuance of “all or a significant portion” of the employer’s business
    at a specific location (s. 69(1)(e)); or, on the sale of the employer’s
    business without a continuing pension plan (s. 69(1)(f)).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Tribunal acknowledged that a wind-up order under s.
    69(1) could only be made by the Superintendent where “one of several serious
    events out of the usual course of the employer’s business or the
    employee-employer relationship have [<i>sic</i>] occurred”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The s. 69(1) focus on serious business events is scarcely surprising. 
    The wind-up of a pension plan is an important event for all concerned.  Under
    the Act, even a partial wind-up triggers various statutory rights for the
    involved plan members and imposes numerous and potentially costly statutory
    obligations on both the plan administrator and the employer.  Indeed, in some
    situations, a partial pension plan wind-up may affect the on-going viability of
    the plan itself.  For these reasons, not every change in the status or business
    of an employer, or in the sponsored pension plan, will give rise to a potential
    wind-up order.  Equally, however, s. 69(1) recognizes that the nature of some
    business events can endanger the entitlement of plan members to continuing
    employment or to the receipt of retirement pension benefits, thereby
    potentially justifying a wind-up order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hydro One Group submits that the nature of the events enumerated in
    s.&nbsp;69(1) signifies a legislative intention that a partial or full wind-up
    order be available only where an “extraordinary event” involving the employer,
    or its business, places the security of pension benefits for <i>all</i> plan
    members at risk.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept this submission.  This narrow characterization of the
    purpose of s. 69(1) is inconsistent with its remedial and protective aims and
    those of the Act.  Were it accepted, it would set the bar too high for the
    preservative intervention contemplated by s.&nbsp;69(1).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, properly read, s. 69(1) requires that the trigger for a
    wind-up order be an event that endangers the continued availability of pension
    benefits for a material number of plan members, assessed in the context of the
    applicable pension plan.  A threat to the future security of pension benefits
    for all members of the relevant pension plan is a possible, but not a necessary,
    precondition to an order under s. 69(1).  Consider the language of s.&nbsp;69(1)
    itself.  As I have said, a partial wind-up may be ordered under s. 69(1)(f)
    where part of an employer’s business or assets is disposed of and the person
    who acquires the property fails to provide a pension plan for the members of
    the former employer’s pension plan.  In these circumstances, there is no
    requirement that the plan as a whole be at risk before a partial wind-up may be
    ordered.</p>
  <h2><i>(c)       Section 69(1)(d)</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I turn to the particular purpose of s.&nbsp;69(1)(d).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Stelco</i>, (PCO, at p. 44), the former Pension Commission of
    Ontario suggested that s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) was enacted to protect older, long
    service employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In enacting section 69(1)(d) the Legislature was
    concerned about protecting older employees with appreciable amounts of service
    who involuntarily lose their employment as a result of a major change in the
    way in which their employer carries on its business.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have already mentioned, a full or partial pension plan wind-up
    triggers various statutory rights for affected plan members, including the
    right to a distribution of any surplus in the plan, the right to immediate
    vesting in the plan and the right to certain transfer options: see ss. 42,
    70(6) and 73 of the Act.  In addition, terminated plan members whose age plus years
    of service total 55 are entitled to “grow-in” benefits under s. 74 of the Act. 
    These benefits permit eligible plan members whose employment has ceased to
    “grow-in” to the early retirement benefits available under the relevant pension
    plan by including in their pension benefits any early retirement benefit
    provided by the plan to which they would have been entitled if the plan had not
    been wound up, in whole or in part.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[9]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent submits that the provision of statutory grow-in
    benefits for older plan members with long service indicates that the wind-up mechanism
    provided for under s. 69(1)(d) of the Act is intended to compensate such
    members for the cessation of employment at a relatively late stage of life.  On
    this basis, it is said, a broad and purposive interpretation should be given to
    significance under this provision, as the number of terminations may be
    significant where employees within a targeted group are older, or if the employment
    terminations occurred over a relatively short time span.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the benefits available on a plan wind-up are relevant to
    the discretionary decision not to order a wind-up notwithstanding that the
    statutory preconditions for a wind-up order are satisfied, as are the benefits
    provided by the employer, if any, to the terminated members as a result of the business
    reorganization at issue.  Thus, for example, partial wind-ups have been denied
    by the Superintendent where additional or enhanced early retirement benefits
    have been furnished to affected employees, consistent with those otherwise
    available under the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I make two additional observations regarding the Superintendent’s
    submission.  First, grow-in benefits only arise if a wind-up order is otherwise
    made.  They are a consequence of, rather than authority for, a wind-up order. 
    Second, while I agree that the age of terminated plan members may bear on the
    question of the significance of the number of terminations (for example, where
    it is demonstrated that the reorganization targeted older employees), this assumes
    that a subset analysis under s. 69(1)(d) is otherwise permissible.  Age is not
    a factor that provides stand-alone authority for a subset analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the purpose of s. 69(1)(d) flows from its remedial
    nature.  It is intended to permit a wind-up order consequent upon a business
    reorganization (or discontinuance) that endangers the security of pension
    benefits for a material number of plan members, in the context of the
    applicable pension plan.  Section 69(1)(d) is concerned with protecting the
    retirement income security of those members of a pension plan whose employment
    ceases in such circumstances, thus ending their participation in the pension
    plan.  The materiality of the number of affected plan members is
    case-specific.  It will depend on a host of factors relating to the specific
    pension plan and reorganization (or discontinuance) at issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the question of how to determine what constitutes “a
    significant number of members of the pension plan” under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d)
    cannot depend on hard and fast rules.  The crucial point is that a fixed or
    closed approach to the means by which this question is assessed would inhibit,
    and in some cases perhaps preclude, the Superintendent from reaching the just
    result contemplated by s. 69(1)(d).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I discuss later in these reasons, contrary to the Hydro One Group’s
    contention, this is not to say that a significance inquiry under s. 69(1)(d) is
    entirely open-ended or arbitrary, or that there are no principles to guide the
    Superintendent and the Tribunal in determining when a subset analysis may be
    conducted under that provision.  In <i>Monsanto</i> and <i>Nolan</i>, the Supreme
    Court of Canada approved an interpretation of the Act that seeks to recognize
    its protectionist aims, while balancing the interests of employers and
    employees alike.  These objectives must anchor the interpretation of
    significance under s.&nbsp;69(1)(d).  </p>
  <h2>(iii)     Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the expansive and unrestricted language of s. 69(1)(d)
    and the remedial and protective nature of the Act in general and of s. 69(1) –
    including s. 69(1)(d) – in particular, support the conclusion that a flexible
    approach is to be taken to a significance inquiry under s. 69(1)(d).  It
    follows that a significance inquiry under that provision may be based on a
    subset analysis in order to evaluate the materiality of the number of plan
    member terminations occasioned by a business reorganization.  I pass now to the
    reasonableness of the Tribunal’s decision to conduct a subset analysis in this
    case.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the Divisional Court ruled at para. 55 of its
    reasons: “[T]he approach taken by the Tribunal in the application of the
    statute to the facts was reasonable.”  On my reading of the entirety of the
    Divisional Court’s reasons, this conclusion appears to have been based on three
    considerations: (i) the court’s view that it was open to the Tribunal, as a
    matter of law, to utilize a subset analysis to determine significance under s.
    69(1)(d); (ii) the Tribunal’s factual findings concerning the purpose of the
    Merger; and (iii) the court’s view that the Tribunal’s treatment of Hydro One’s
    collective agreement with the Society was reasonable.  For the following
    reasons, I agree with the Divisional Court that these considerations support
    the reasonableness of the Tribunal’s application of s. 69(1)(d).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have already concluded that the Tribunal was correct to interpret s.
    69(1)(d) as permitting a significance inquiry based on a subset analysis.  I
    therefore agree with the first consideration identified by the Divisional
    Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also my opinion that the Tribunal’s factual findings concerning
    the purpose and focus of the Merger lay the ground for the reasonableness of
    using a subset analysis to determine the significance of the number of plan
    member terminations caused by the Merger.  As the Divisional Court noted, at
    paras. 11-12 of its reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Tribunal found that the [Merger] and three
    earlier discrete initiatives since January 1, 2000 involving down-sizings were
    designed in part to reduce “legacy costs” of a too expensive payroll inherited
    from the predecessor corporation, Ontario Hydro, and to introduce a more
    competitive attitude within the work force.  The Tribunal stated that from
    management’s standpoint “there were too many employees, and on average, they
    were too senior in age.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Tribunal concluded in respect of the [Merger]
    that “the merger was an excuse, rather than a reason to further thin out staff,
    particularly staff with some seniority.”  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These key findings are not challenged on appeal.  They establish that the
    Merger targeted, at least in part, older members of the Plan whose retirement
    years were approaching.  The Tribunal expressly rejected the suggestion that
    the employment of the Affected MCP Employees was terminated due to staff
    redundancies arising on the Merger.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that the
    terminations were performance or competency-related.  Rather, the terminations constituted
    a cost reduction measure that was also intended to generate attitudinal change
    within Hydro One’s work force.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Affected MCP Employees are precisely the type of employees for
    whom pension security is of most immediate and tangible concern, and whose
    pension benefits fall within the protective purview of s. 69(1)(d) of the Act. 
    The fact that the Merger was intentionally directed at senior employees nearing
    retirement, coupled with the fact that their terminations were involuntary and
    unrelated to performance or competency, affords a clear and rational basis for
    the Tribunal to focus its significance analysis on those members of the Plan
    most directly affected by the Merger.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hydro One Group submits that this case is factually distinguishable
    from <i>London Life</i> and, on that basis, argues that a subset analysis was
    unreasonable here.  The Hydro One Group points out that the reorganization in <i>London
    Life</i> targeted only the administrative side of the employer’s business, which
    encompassed a substantial portion of the pension plan members.  As a result,
    the relevant terminations affected only employees who worked in that segment of
    the employer’s business.  In contrast, the Merger here affected MCP, Society,
    and other employees of Hydro One.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not regard these distinctions as detracting from the reasonableness
    of the Tribunal’s decision to employ a subset analysis in this case.  On the
    Tribunal’s factual findings, the MCP employees constituted a proportion of the
    total Plan membership that was “not trivial”.  The Tribunal also held that if the
    MCP employees had their own pension plan with Hydro One, the percentage of
    Affected MCP Employees (18% of all MCP employees) “would be well within the
    range of terminations considered ‘significant’, on the existing authorities”. 
    I agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, as in <i>London </i>Life, the Merger targeted a specific
    and identifiable group of employees.  In <i>London Life</i>, the targeted group
    was comprised of administrative staff.  In this case, the targeted group
    consisted of long-service employees with costly compensation arrangements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Huus,</i> this court emphasized that pension plans are created for
    the benefit of employees, not the companies that sponsor them.  Justice MacPherson
    indicated at para. 25: “[Pension plans] are a particularly important component
    of the compensation employees receive in return for their labour.  They are not
    a gift from the employer; they are earned by the employees.”  I endorse these
    comments.  As pointed out by Deschamps J. in <i>Buschau</i>, at paras. 12 and
    31, “Employees rightly see their pension benefits as part of their overall
    compensation” and “either employees contribute directly or their entitlement is
    regarded as remuneration deferred until the date of their retirement.”  See
    also <i>Monsanto</i>, at p. 172.  I add that the security of promised pension
    benefits for employees whose re-employment prospects may be limited due to
    advancing age is of special import.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third and final consideration identified by the Divisional Court
    concerned the Tribunal’s treatment of Hydro One’s collective agreement with the
    Society.  There are two aspects to this issue.  First, the Tribunal ruled that,
    while not germane to the determination of significance under s. 69(1)(d), the
    fact that the Plan is incorporated into collective agreements between Hydro One
    and the respondent unions was a relevant factor to be weighed by the
    Superintendent when deciding whether to order a partial wind-up of the Plan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, when deciding whether to direct the Superintendent to order a
    partial wind-up of the Plan, the Tribunal adverted to the fact that the MCP
    employees were “unprotected” by collective agreements, they had “no opportunity
    to consider trade-offs for any rights they might have under a wind-up”, and
    “There is no evidence that they received any compensating benefit for loss of
    those rights.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hydro
    One Group contends that the Tribunal improperly based its use of a subset
    analysis on the fact that the Affected MCP Employees did not have the benefits
    of union representation.  They submit that, in so doing, the Tribunal erred as there
    is no language in the Act that supports differentiation between unionized and
    non-unionized members of the same pension plan when determining whether a
    wind-up should be ordered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot
    accede to this characterization of the Tribunal’s treatment of this issue.  The
    Tribunal said only that, if the authority afforded by s. 69(1)(d) can be
    invoked in a given case, the provisions of a collective agreement may inform the
    Superintendent’s discretionary decision whether to exercise that authority by
    ordering the wind-up of a pension plan.  I see nothing objectionable in this
    approach.  Indeed, like the Divisional Court, I regard it as reasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that
    the Hydro One Group argued before the Tribunal that the voluntary severance
    arrangements negotiated with the Affected Society Employees should be
    respected.  In effect, the Hydro One Group took the position that bargains
    negotiated between the employer and a union are relevant factors to be taken
    into account in determining whether to direct a wind-up order.  Having taken
    this position, the Hydro One Group cannot be heard to now complain that its argument
    was accepted by the Tribunal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I agree
    that the Tribunal erred or that its application of s. 69(1)(d) was rendered
    unreasonable by taking into account the ‘unrepresented’ status of the Affected
    MCP Employees.  It is a fact that the Affected Society Employees enjoyed
    negotiated severance packages after the Merger, whereas the Affected MCP
    Employees did not.  The reasons of the Tribunal and the record before this
    court do not reveal the details of those packages.  Nor do they indicate what
    severance arrangements were put in place for the Affected MCP Employees
    pursuant to statutory or common law entitlements.  Relying on <i>Imperial Oil
    Ltd. v. Atlantic Oil Workers Union, Local No.1</i>, [2006] NSCA 100, leave to
    appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 403, the Tribunal properly recognized that
    severance benefits aim to compensate different losses than benefits available
    on the wind-up of a pension plan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The critical,
    undisputed fact is that the employment of the Affected MCP Employees was
    involuntarily terminated without provision of any of the benefits contemplated
    by the Act.  In contrast, the Affected Society Employees voluntarily applied at
    the time of the Merger to take up the severance option negotiated by the
    Society with Hydro One and, on acceptance, terminated their employment.  As the
    Tribunal noted, “[A] number of Society-represented employees who applied to
    terminate under this offer were refused.”  Given these facts, the position of
    the Hydro One Group was described as follows by the Tribunal: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where employees are leaving a pension plan when they
    terminate, the extent of their present and future rights with respect to that
    plan is a factor which both parties to a collective agreement must weigh.  <i>Where,
    for what are con-sidered by the bargaining parties, especially the repre-sentatives
    of the employees, good reasons to accept some equivalent, not necessarily in
    the pension area, for what employees might obtain if the representatives
    pressed for a wind up or partial wind up, this should be respected by
    regulators</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, by
    noting that the Affected MCP Employees were unrepresented by either union, the
    Tribunal was simply responding to the argument advanced by the Hydro One Group
    and underscoring that the Affected MCP Employees were not the beneficiaries of
    the same considerations and bargaining realities that governed the Affected
    Society Members.  This, too, was accurate and unobjectionable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Dunsmuir</i> emphasizes that some decisions that come before administrative tribunals “do
    not lend themselves to one specific, particular result”.  On the contrary,
    “[t]hey may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions. 
    Tribunals have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and
    rational solutions”: <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at para. 47.  Deference is owed to the
    Tribunal’s decision to conduct part of its significance inquiry under s.
    69(1)(d) of the Act on the basis of a subset analysis if that decision “falls
    within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible on the
    facts and the law” and if the justification for the decision is sound, transparent
    and intelligible: <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at para. 47.  I conclude that the Tribunal’s
    application of s. 69(1)(d) to the facts of this case satisfies these
    requirements and, therefore, that it was reasonable. </p>

    version of s. 69(1)(d) of the Act from the time of the first official reporting
    in Ontario of that version: see <i>Loi sur les r</i><i>égimes de retraite</i>,
    L.R.O. 1990, c. P. 8.</p>

    Superintendent is required to specify, among other matters, the persons or
    “class or classes of persons” to whom the plan administrator must provide
    notice of the order.  Similar language appears in s. 89(5) of the Act, which
    concerns the notice to be given of a proposed wind-up of a pension plan or of a
    declaration that a pension plan is wound up.  These provisions are designed to
    ensure that persons to be affected thereby, receive notice of a wind-up.</p>

    apply to eligible plan members whose employment is terminated by their employer
    otherwise than for cause.</p>
