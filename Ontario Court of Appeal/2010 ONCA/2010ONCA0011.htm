  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party requests an order compelling disclosure of records in
    the hands of the Crown and the Ministry of the Attorney General relating to the
    interpretation services provided by five interpreters at his trial. He claims
    that the records will either provide evidence for a proposed application to
    introduce fresh evidence on appeal or assist him in generating such evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The records the moving party is asking for fall into three broad
    categories:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>records in the hands of the Ministry of the Attorney General concerning
      the qualifications, competency and accreditation of the five interpreters who
      provided interpretation services at his trial;</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>records in the hands of the Ministry of the Attorney General or the
      Crown concerning what I will call “who knew what when” about alleged systemic
      issues in relation to the quality of interpretation services at the Brampton
      courthouse; and </p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>copies of the audiotapes of the evidence of the witnesses at his trial
      who required interpretation services, which the moving party proposes to use to
      obtain an independent expert opinion concerning the adequacy of such
      interpretation services. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his request, the moving party relies on material indicating
    that the competency of one of the three Punjabi interpreters who provided
    interpretation services at his trial has been called into question in other
    cases and that the Twi interpreter provided for one of the witnesses at his trial
    was not accredited by the Ministry of the Attorney General. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the motion.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a jury trial that lasted about three months, the moving party
    was convicted, on November 25, 2004, of the second degree murder of his former
    girlfriend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim died on July 7, 2001. At trial, the Crown alleged that the moving
    party killed the victim in a jealous rage and that he later confessed, on
    separate occasions, to his younger brother, to his older brother and to his
    father. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the moving party’s father and older brother gave evidence at
    trial confirming the moving party’s confession to them, the moving party’s
    younger brother, Ranjit, recanted his preliminary inquiry evidence, and gave
    evidence at trial providing the moving  party  with  an alibi for  the
    afternoon of  July 7, 2001.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The  recanted testimony proved to be false; Ranjit admitted at his subsequent perjury trial that he
    lied to protect his brother. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span

  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party’s mother tongue is Punjabi. On this motion, he
    acknowledges that he has been in Canada for a number of years, that he has
    completed some grade 10 courses in Canada and that he did not have the assistance
    of an interpreter at the preliminary inquiry, at any of his set date
    appearances in the Superior Court or during pre-trial motions in the Superior
    Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party claims that he requested a Punjabi interpreter for his
    trial, that the Crown argued that he did not require an interpreter and that
    the trial judge ordered that he be provided with an interpreter on an “as
    needed basis”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the moving party also acknowledges that “[t]he defence
    conceded some degree of proficiency in English and asked that an interpreter be
    made available [at his trial proper] on an as needed basis.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party has also acknowledged, by way of an Agreed Statement of
    Fact on this motion, that several witnesses would testify to his proficiency in
    English.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER"><b>iii)<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the interpretation services provided for the moving party,
    interpreters were required for six witnesses at the trial proper and for one
    other witness on a pre-trial motion:</p>
  <blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the moving party’s younger brother, Ranjit, testified primarily in
      English at trial but also had a Punjabi interpreter present to assist him if
      required. Once again, the moving party claims that Ranjit asked for but was
      denied the opportunity to testify through a Punjabi interpreter. The trial
      transcript indicates that Ranjit used an interpreter at several points during
      his examination by Crown counsel but that he did not use an interpreter during
      cross-examination by the moving party’s counsel. The Crown points out that
      Ranjit testified in English at the preliminary inquiry and at his subsequent
      perjury trial; </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Bhandhal was the primary Punjabi interpreter. She sat beside the moving
    party during most of the trial and also provided interpretation services for
    the moving party’s older brother who testified in Punjabi. She may have
    provided interpretation services to the moving party’s father, who also
    testified in Punjabi.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            v)       The Moving Party’s Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party filed a solicitor’s notice of appeal against conviction
    on April 18, 2006. Although the trial transcripts were fully filed on June 12,
    2007, more than two years ago, the appeal has not yet been perfected.  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER"><b>vi)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Moving Party’s Motion Record</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the moving party’s notice of motion and notice of appeal,
    the moving party’s motion record consists of various letters between appeal
    counsel; a series of transcript excerpts from the moving party’s trial, from the
    summary conviction appeal proceedings in <i>R. v. Sidhu</i> (2005), 203 C.C.C.
    (3d) 17 (Ont. S.C.) and from the unrelated trial of <i>R. v. Jughar Singh</i>;
    as well as correspondence from a Brampton assistant Crown attorney, a Brampton
    court administrator and a Mississauga lawyer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these materials are identified or authenticated in an affidavit.
    Indeed, the moving party’s motion record does not contain any affidavit
    evidence at all. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as part of his motion record, the moving party filed a draft
    notice of application to introduce fresh evidence on appeal relating to the
    interpretation services provided at his trial. The draft notice of application stipulates
    that the fresh evidence will be introduced in support of three arguments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, an argument that the moving party was deprived of his s. 14 <i>Charter</i> rights because the main Punjabi interpreter provided to him was not competent
    to interpret and her level of interpretation fell below constitutional
    standards.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, an argument that the manner and quality of interpretation
    provided at the moving party’s trial was generally incompetent and fell below
    constitutional standards both for the moving party and various witnesses at the
    trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, an argument that, to the knowledge of the local Crown and the
    Ministry of the Attorney General, there were systemic problems with the quality
    of interpretation at the Brampton courthouse where the moving party’s trial
    took place and that the manner in which these problems impacted the moving
    party’s trial tarnished the appearance of fairness and resulted in a
    miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Moving Party’s Position on this Disclosure Motion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party claims he is entitled to disclosure of the records
    noted in para. 2 above for three reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Ms. Bhandhal’s competence as a Punjabi interpreter has been
    questioned and may have been found wanting in at least three other cases: <i>R.
    v. Singh</i> (June 2003); <i>R. v. Naranjan</i> (December 2004); and <i>R. v.
    Mann</i> (January 2005). She was also the subject of a complaint in a fourth
    case, <i>R. v. Sohi</i> (January 2005).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, although Ms. Bhandhal apparently passed Ministry of the
    Attorney General Punjabi accreditation tests on July 9, 2002 and again in 2005,
    Punjabi is not her mother tongue, she may not read Punjabi and she previously
    failed the accreditation test on August 10, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, evidence given in <i>R. v. Sidhu</i> indicates that Mr. Barning
    was not an accredited interpreter at the time he provided interpretation
    services at the moving party’s trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, set in the context of a large-scale systemic problem with the
    interpretation services provided at the Brampton courthouse, which was known to
    the Crown and Ministry of the Attorney General, the quality of interpretation
    provided at the moving party’s trial undermined the appearance of fairness and
    resulted in a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leaving aside any issues concerning the propriety of the moving party’s
    material, the fundamental problem with the moving party’s motion is that he has
    failed to establish any air of reality to his claims that the quality of
    interpretation services provided at <i>his</i> trial was in any way deficient;
    that it resulted in a breach of <i>his</i> s. 14 <i>Charter</i> rights; or that
    it had any other adverse impact on the fairness of <i>his</i> trial. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Rybak</i> (2008), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 58 (Ont. C.A.), the
    appellant relied on fresh evidence demonstrating systemic issues with the
    interpretation services provided at the Brampton courthouse and an
    interpreter’s lack of accreditation by the Ministry of the Attorney General to
    support an argument that his s. 14 <i>Charter</i> rights were breached.
    Although this court stated that unaccredited interpreters “may only be used in
    situations of extreme emergency”, the court nonetheless concluded that the
    fresh evidence “lack[ed] a nexus to the proceedings at the appellant’s trial”
    and did not give effect to the ground of appeal depending on the fresh evidence.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Watt J.A., speaking for the court, said the following at para 98 of <i>Rybak</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What is lacking in the appellant’s fresh evidence
    materials, is a nexus between the systemic and accreditation flaws identified
    in the materials filed, and the interpreter assistance provided in this case:
    no affidavit of other evidence from the appellant, none from trial counsel and
    deafening silence in the trial record. Something supportive of <i>this</i> claim of constitutional infringement is necessary, but lacking. [Emphasis in
    the original; citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same can be said of the materials filed by the moving party on this
    motion. Even assuming that the material filed by the moving party demonstrates
    that Mr. Barning was not an accredited interpreter at the time he provided
    interpretation services at the moving party’s trial and that Ms. Bandhal’s interpretation
    skills have been found wanting in other cases, the material contains nothing to
    indicate that these potential concerns manifested themselves in any genuine
    problems at the moving party’s trial. </p>

      filed any affidavit evidence from anyone to indicate whether he or anyone else
      perceived any difficulties with the Punjabi interpretation services provided to
      the Punjabi-speaking witnesses at trial. Further, the moving party has not
      filed any material on this motion that would in any way detract from the
      acknowledgment made through counsel at his trial that he did not require full

      rather than interpreting it, no issue was raised at trial concerning the
      competence or performance of any of the five interpreters who provided

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Trotta</i> (2004), 23 C.R. (6th) 261 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty
    J.A. noted, at para. 23, that while the Crown’s disclosure obligations remain
    in force following a conviction, “the resolution of disclosure disputes on
    appeal will require a somewhat different analytical framework” than that which
    applies during trials. This is because the presumption of innocence is no
    longer in play and also because, unless successful on appeal, the accused will
    have exhausted his right to make full answer and defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A. stated that in the appellate context what is necessary is
    that the Crown’s disclosure obligation “recognize and give full value to an
    accused’s broad right of appeal and the rationale underlying those rights.”
    Accordingly, “[t]he Crown's disclosure obligation on appeal must extend to any
    information in the possession of the Crown that there is a reasonable
    possibility may assist the accused in the prosecution of his or her appeal.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the specific context of a production motion made in support of an
    application to introduce fresh evidence on appeal to which the <i>Palmer</i> criteria applies, Doherty J.A. concluded that two conditions must be fulfilled
    to warrant an order for production:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>To obtain production, the applicant must first
    demonstrate a connection between the request for production and the fresh
    evidence he proposes to adduce</i>. The applicant must show that there is a
    reasonable possibility that the material sought could assist on the motion to
    adduce fresh evidence. By assist, I mean yield material that will be admissible
    as fresh evidence, or assist the applicant in developing or obtaining material
    that will be admissible as fresh evidence. <i>The applicant must next
    demonstrate that there is some reasonable possibility that the evidence to
    which the production request is linked may be received as fresh evidence on
    appeal.</i> Unless the appellant can make both links, there is no reasonable
    possibility that the material sought could assist in the prosecution of the
    appeal and consequently, no reason for this court to require the Crown to
    disclose it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the moving party that the second prong of the <i>Trotta</i> test does not strictly apply in a case such as this where the proposed fresh
    evidence relates to the integrity of the trial process and there is therefore no
    question concerning the admissibility of the proposed fresh evidence. However,
    I do not agree that this means that the second prong of the <i>Trotta</i> test
    should simply be eliminated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second prong of the <i>Trotta</i> test is aimed at requiring that the
    moving party show a reasonable possibility that a production order will assist
    in developing a successful ground of appeal. Considered in that context, the
    problem with the moving party’s material is that he has failed to demonstrate
    even an air of reality to his claim that some form of interpretation problems
    existed in <i>his</i> case in circumstances where it is reasonable to believe
    that he should be able to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, there is nothing in this record to suggest that the
    appellant would not be able to identify at least the possibility of a problem
    with the Punjabi interpretation at his trial if such a problem existed. Further,
    there is nothing in this record to suggest any lack of competence,
    qualifications or accreditation on the part of the Polish interpreter; nor is
    there anything to suggest that any problems arose with the interpretation of
    the evidence of the witnesses who spoke Polish or Twi. Finally, even if the
    moving party could not reasonably be expected to identify a problem with the
    Twi or Polish interpretation, there is nothing in this record to suggest that
    their evidence was other than peripheral such that any problem with its interpretation
    is capable of giving rise to a miscarriage of justice on the facts of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the moving party’s requests for records relating to the
    qualifications, competency and accreditation of the interpreters and “who knew
    what when” will do nothing to assist in establishing a nexus between
    interpretation problems that may have existed in other cases and the quality of
    interpretation in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the moving party’s requests for copies of the audio recordings of
    the evidence of certain witnesses is at least directed toward obtaining records
    that could demonstrate an interpretation problem in this case, as I have said,
    on the record before us, there is simply no air of reality to the moving
    party’s claim that any such problem existed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the moving party’s requests appear to be no more than a
    fishing expedition that will inevitably have the effect of creating unnecessary
    expense and further delaying this appeal that has already dragged on for an
    inordinate period of time. </p>
