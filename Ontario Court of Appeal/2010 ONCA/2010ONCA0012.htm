  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Weber submits that the trial judge erred in five respects.  One, Mr.
    Weber contends that the trial judge erred in averaging his income over the
    three years preceding trial for the purpose of determining support.  We do not
    accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was of the view that averaging would produce the fairest
    income number.  As Mr. Weber was self employed and was not fully forthcoming in
    his disclosure, we think that the trial judge exercise of discretion to average
    was reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two, Mr. Weber contends that, in ordering child support, the trial judge
    erred because he did not give effect to the reality that two of the five
    children were living with Mr. Weber.  Again, we disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That two of the children were living with Mr. Weber was first raised
    after Mrs. Weber had put in her case and after both parties had consented to an
    order incorporating the parenting plan.  When apprised of the new information,
    the trial judge gave Mr. Weber a choice: a mistrial or agree to the parenting
    plan.  Mr. Weber said that he did not want a mistrial.  However, the trial
    judge expressly told Mr. Weber that he could bring a motion to vary.  We note
    that even as of today, he has not brought that motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three, Mr. Weber contends that the trial judge erred in valuing the
    long-term debt of $355,000 at zero.  There were some factors, referred to by
    Mr. Joseph, that supported giving that debt some value.  However, there were a
    large number of factors, referred to at paras. 28 to 32 of the trial judge’s
    reasons, that led the trial judge to value the debt at zero.  That zero
    valuation is, therefore, reasonably supported by the evidence and not
    reviewable in this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four, Mr. Weber further contends that the trial judge failed to exclude
    from the net family property calculation the proceeds derived from the sale of
    the Puslinch property.  That property was a gift to Mr. Weber, but he did not
    segregate the proceeds or lead any evidence from which they could fairly be
    traced either into his bank account or his company.  Accordingly, the trial
    judge did not err in finding that the proceeds were untraceable and, therefore,
    did not err in refusing to expressly exclude the proceeds from the NFP
    calculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five, finally Mr. Weber seeks leave to appeal the partial indemnity
    costs award in favour of Mrs. Weber.  He argues that the trial judge’s award
    fails to recognize that Mr. Weber succeeded on some issues.  Presumptively,
    under the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, Mrs. Weber was entitled to her costs.  The
    trial judge in exercising his discretion recognized that Mr. Weber achieved
    success on some issues but overall was of the view that this success did not
    displace the presumption or warrant a reduction in costs.  We are not persuaded
    that the trial judge erred in principle in his costs award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for these brief reasons, the appeal is dismissed, with
    costs fixed at $18,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
