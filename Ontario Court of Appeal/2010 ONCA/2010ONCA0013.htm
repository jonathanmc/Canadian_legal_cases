  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rosenhek and the Metropolitan General Hospital (now part of the
    Windsor Regional Hospital) (the “Hospital”) have been in litigation for 20
    years.  These appeals are from the judgment of Quinn J. dated July 24, 2007, awarding
    Dr. Rosenhek damages of $3,000,000 plus pre-judgment interest.  The Hospital
    appeals from the finding of liability and the damage assessment.  Dr. Rosenhek
    cross-appeals from the damage assessment.  We are satisfied that the appeal and
    cross-appeal should be dismissed for the reasons that follow.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rosenhek made several claims against the Hospital.  They all
    centered around the contention that the Board of Governors of the Hospital (the
    “Board”) acted in bad faith in March 1989 when it summarily revoked Dr.
    Rosenhek’s privileges at the Hospital and effectively ended his ability to work
    there.  Dr. Rosenhek alleged that the Board’s actions caused him to lose
    substantial income over the next 10 years.  The trial judge found that the
    Board acted in bad faith.  He also found that the Board’s conduct caused Dr.
    Rosenhek to lose income over several years.  The trial judge was, however,
    critical of the evidence put forward by Dr. Rosenhek to quantify that loss and
    awarded damages that were significantly less than those sought by Dr.
    Rosenhek.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Hospital’s arguments against the finding of liability
    target in one way or another the trial judge’s finding that in revoking Dr.
    Rosenhek’s privileges the Board acted in bad faith.  Before turning to those submissions,
    a description of the background in which these events arose and a chronology of
    the relevant events is helpful. </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(i)  The Working Arrangements at the
    Hospital </span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hospital is a community hospital in Windsor, Ontario.  Community
    hospitals do not hire doctors.  Instead, doctors are given privileges allowing
    them to admit and treat patients in the hospital.  Doctors with privileges are
    not employees or party to any contract for service with the hospital.  The
    doctors operate as “independent business persons”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a doctor has privileges at a hospital, he or she can admit patients
    to that hospital and use the publically-funded resources there to care for
    patients.  A patient who is admitted to the Hospital is the responsibility of
    the admitting physician.  For specialists like Dr. Rosenhek, privileges are
    crucial to earning a livelihood.  Without hospital privileges, he could not
    access hospital facilities to care for his patients.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applications for privileges at the Hospital proceed through a series of committees
    staffed by doctors who work there.  That process culminates in a decision by
    the Board.  The Board can grant privileges and place qualifications on those
    privileges.  Privileges are granted for a specific time – usually a year – and
    the onus is on the doctor to reapply at the appropriate time for a renewal of
    their privileges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board has the statutory power to revoke or suspend the privileges of
    a doctor.  In doing so, the Board must comply with certain statutory procedural
    requirements.  When Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges were revoked in March 1989, the
    Board’s powers were governed by the <i>Public Hospitals Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980 c.
    410.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(ii)  The Chronology of Relevant Events</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rosenhek first applied for privileges at the Hospital in May 1984.  During
    the previous year, he had been certified as a specialist in cardiology.  There
    were no cardiologists at the Hospital, although Dr. Rosenhek’s speciality
    overlapped with work done at the Hospital by specialists in internal medicine. 
    The Board gave Dr. Rosenhek “associate staff” privileges for one year in July
    1984.  This was the equivalent of a probationary appointment and was typical
    for a first appointment at the Hospital.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges were renewed from time to time between May
    1985 and January 1989.  Some issues did arise in respect of those renewals.  There
    were personality conflicts.  Dr. Rosenhek was seen by some as arrogant and overly
    demanding.  The primary problem, however, arose out of Dr. Rosenhek’s inability
    to gain entry to the coverage group to which the other internists at the Hospital
    belonged.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the coverage group scheme, one internist in the group was on call
    at any given time for the hospitalized patients of all the other doctors who belonged
    to the group.  For a doctor like Dr. Rosenhek, who was not in a coverage group,
    the only relief from full-time responsibility for one’s hospitalized patients came
    through the “on call” roster available at the hospital.  However, that facility
    provided only limited relief to physicians who were not part of a coverage
    group.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exclusion of Dr. Rosenhek from the coverage group stemmed, at least in
    part, from the circumstances that predated Dr. Rosenhek’s arrival at the Hospital. 
    When Dr. Rosenhek arrived, there were plans to develop a critical-care unit. 
    Under that proposed plan, the critical-care unit would be staffed by a limited
    number of specialists who would have responsibility for all patients who were
    in the critical care unit regardless of which doctor had admitted the patient. 
    When Dr. Rosenhek came to the Hospital, it was anticipated that he would be one
    of the “super specialists” assigned to run the critical care unit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the critical-care plan was put forward, it was opposed by a number
    of the internists who had privileges at the Hospital.  Ultimately, the plan did
    not go ahead.  After the critical-care plan was rejected, personal divisions
    that had developed among the doctors over its merits lingered.  Dr. Rosenhek
    found himself excluded from the internists’ coverage group.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1988, Dr. Rosenhek brought his concerns about his inability to become
    part of a coverage group to the attention of the Board.  Dr. Rosenhek complained
    that he was on call at virtually all times and that the stress of this workload
    was adversely affecting his health.  Dr. Rosenhek indicated he was under the
    care of a psychiatrist.  The Hospital regarded the coverage controversy as a
    private matter among the doctors in the group and declined to become actively
    involved in any attempt to resolve the issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board renewed Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges for three months in January
    1989.  He was given associate staff status.  The limited length of the renewal and
    the associate staff status presumably reflected Dr. Rosenhek’s ongoing problems
    obtaining adequate coverage and getting along with the other specialists who
    were involved in the care of cardiac patients.  It is important to note,
    however, that there was never any concern about Dr. Rosenhek’s competence as a
    cardiologist or his ability to effectively care for his patients.  During the
    entire time Dr. Rosenhek worked at the hospital, neither was in issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 20, 1989, some two months into his three-month renewal, the Hospital’s
    Medical Advisory Committee (“MAC”) recommended the immediate revocation of Dr.
    Rosenhek’s privileges.  Two days later, without any notice to Dr. Rosenhek, the
    Board adopted that recommendation and revoked his privileges, effective
    immediately.  Dr. Rosenhek was required to leave the Hospital at once.  The
    Board later provided a letter to Dr. Rosenhek setting out the reasons for the
    revocation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rosenhek appealed the Board’s revocation of his privileges to the Hospital
    Appeal Board (“Appeal Board”).  For reasons that need not be set out, the
    appeal was not heard until December 1993.  In January 1994, the Appeal Board
    found that the hospital had complied with its statutory obligations relating to
    a mid-term revocation of privileges but had failed to give Dr. Rosenhek adequate
    notice of the revocation.  In so holding, the Appeal Board relied on decisions
    given by it subsequent to the revocation of Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges in 1989. 
    The Appeal Board ordered a new hearing.  Based on information placed before it,
    the Appeal Board declined to order Dr. Rosenhek’s reinstatement pending that
    re-hearing.  The reasons of the Appeal Board were before the trial judge.  The
    parties agreed that the findings of fact made by the Appeal Board were binding
    on the parties at trial.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the re-hearing took the form of a <i>de novo</i> appeal
    before a differently constituted panel of the Appeal Board.  In April 1996, the
    Appeal Board (“1996 Appeal Board”) released reasons setting aside the order of
    the Board revoking Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges, and ordering that Dr. Rosenhek be
    granted active staff privileges at the Hospital.  The 1996 Appeal Board gave
    detailed reasons for its decision.  Those reasons were also before the trial
    judge and it was agreed that the findings of fact made in those reasons would
    apply at the trial.  The trial judge, in making his findings, relied heavily on
    these reasons.</p>
  <h3> <span style='font-style:normal'>(iii)  The Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the Hospital’s submission that Dr. Rosenhek did
    not have a contractual relationship with the Hospital, and was not an employee
    of the Hospital.  The trial judge went on to hold, however, that as the Board
    was acting as a quasi-judicial body when it revoked Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges,
    the Hospital was liable for Dr. Rosenhek’s damages if the Board acted in bad
    faith in doing so.  The relevant conclusion by the trial judge is found at
    para. 19:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find there was a denial of natural justice on the
    part of the Board of Governors in the manner in which they conducted the
    revocation hearing.  <i>I find there was bad faith on the part of the Board of
    Governors in terminating the privileges of Dr. Rosenhek for a very minor
    problem and for which Dr. Rosenhek may have been only partially responsible.  I
    find the defendant is liable for the damages sustained by Dr. Rosenhek on the
    grounds of a breach of a duty of good faith.</i>  The lack of good faith is
    based on the manner in which the hearing was conducted and the reason for the
    revocation of privileges.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on to find that the Hospital was also liable to Dr.
    Rosenhek for the tort of intentional interference with economic relations.  While
    it is not entirely clear, it would appear that the trial judge found that the
    requirement that the interference be by illegal or unlawful means was satisfied
    by the proof that the Board, in revoking Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges, acted in violation
    of the procedural requirements of ss. 37(6) and 37(7) of the <i>Public
    Hospitals Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a>   </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h2>The Hospital’s Appeal on Liability</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge’s finding of
    liability stands or falls on the bad faith finding.  We agree.  If that finding
    is set aside, then neither basis on which the trial judge found in favour of
    Dr. Rosenhek can stand.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that a bad faith exercise of a statutory, public power
    can, in law, provide a basis for a tort claim by Dr. Rosenhek against the
    hospital: see <i>Harris v. The Law Society of Alberta</i>, [1936] S.C.R. 88; <i>Brown
    v. Waterloo Regional Board of Commissioners of Police</i> (1983), 43 O.R. (2d)
    113 (C.A.), at pp. 121-22; <i>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R.
    263, at paras. 23-32; <i>Freeman-Maloy v. Marsden </i>(2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 401
    (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2006] 2 S.C.R. ix; <i>Roncarelli v.
    Duplessis</i>, [1959] S.C.R. 121.  The Board’s power to revoke Dr. Rosenhek’s
    privileges is found in s. 33(c) of the <i>Public Hospitals Act</i>.  That
    power, in turn, is part of a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the operations
    of public hospitals.  Hospitals are funded largely through the public purse.  A
    purposive reading of the statutory provisions relating to the power to revoke
    privileges demonstrates that it is exercised having regard to various
    public-interest factors relating to, in particular, the quality of care
    provided by the hospital.  Having regard to these features, we think that the
    exercise of the revocation power is properly characterized as public in
    nature.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant accepts that a bad faith exercise by the Board
    of its statutory power to revoke Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges would give rise to a
    personal cause of action for Dr. Rosenhek.  Counsel contends, however, that a
    finding of bad faith against the Board requires more than a demonstration that
    the Board failed to comply with applicable statutory or common law procedural
    requirements, or that the Board’s decision was wrong on the merits.  We do not
    understand counsel for the respondent to disagree with this submission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant makes three arguments challenging the bad
    faith finding.  First, he argues that Dr. Rosenhek did not plead bad faith in
    the revocation of his privileges in his statement of claim and that the trial
    judge, therefore, erred in finding liability founded on bad faith.  The
    pleadings were drafted by Dr. Rosenhek.  They leave much to be desired.  The
    pleadings do, however, refer to a breach of statutory duty and a breach of the
    duty to act fairly.  They describe these breaches as “malicious”.  We are
    satisfied that the bad-faith allegation was before the trial judge and was
    central to the dispute between the parties.  The Hospital did not argue in its
    factum that it did not have adequate notice of the bad-faith allegation at
    trial.  Indeed, this argument took shape only in the course of counsel’s reply
    submissions.  Whatever inadequacies there were in the pleadings, they caused no
    prejudice to the Hospital and, in our view, posed no bar to the trial judge’s
    finding of bad faith.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, counsel for the Hospital submits that the trial judge
    erroneously equated a failure to comply with the rules of natural justice in
    the process surrounding the revocation of Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges with bad
    faith by the Board.  There is a distinction between the failure of an entity
    such as the Board to abide by statutory or other procedural requirements and a
    finding that the Board acted in bad faith in the exercise of its statutory
    powers.  A failure to comply with the requirements of the statute or the
    dictates of natural justice may well give rise to a remedy on review of that
    decision but will not, in and of itself, give rise to a private cause of
    action:  see <i>Welbridge Holdings Ltd. v. The Metropolitan Corporation of
    Greater Winnipeg</i> (1970), [1971] S.C.R. 957, at pp. 968-69.  The trial
    judge’s reasons demonstrate that he was alive to the distinction between a
    finding that a hearing was procedurally flawed and the finding of a bad faith
    exercise of a statutory power (see above, at para. 18).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge, correctly in our view, did consider the
    Board’s failure to accord procedural fairness to Dr. Rosenhek as part of the
    overall evidentiary picture.  The manner in which the Board treated Dr.
    Rosenhek during the process, including its failure to give him fair notice of
    the revocation, could inform the trial judge’s assessment of whether the Board
    acted in bad faith in revoking Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third and main argument advanced by the Hospital essentially comes
    down to a contention that the evidence cannot support a finding of bad faith. 
    This argument focuses on the trial judge’s treatment of the reasons of the 1996
    Appeal Board.  The Hospital submits that, while it agreed to be bound by the
    findings of fact of the 1996 Appeal Board, the trial judge erroneously equated
    the 1996 Appeal Board’s finding that Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges were improperly
    revoked with a finding of bad faith.  The Hospital contends, correctly, that
    the question of bad faith was not before the 1996 Appeal Board.  It further
    argues that, properly understood, the reasons and findings of the 1996 Appeal
    Board do not provide a reasonable ground on which the trial judge could make a
    finding of bad faith.  According to this submission, the findings of the 1996
    Appeal Board go no further than to establish that those responsible for making
    the difficult decision to revoke Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges made an error in
    judgment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This submission cannot withstand a careful review of the trial record. 
    That record, particularly the reasons of the 1996 Appeal Board, provides an
    ample basis on which the trial judge could make a finding of bad faith. 
    Without attempting an exhaustive cataloguing of the evidence that could
    reasonably factor into a finding of bad faith, we will refer to the three
    significant areas of the evidence that supported the bad faith finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We begin with the reasons advanced by the Board for revoking Dr.
    Rosenhek’s privileges.  Reasons were given both in a letter to Dr. Rosenhek in
    April of 1989, and before the 1996 Appeal Board.  The 1996 Appeal Board
    examined each of those reasons carefully and in detail.  The 1996 Appeal Board
    concluded that none of the reasons advanced by the Board for revocation were
    made-out, and that most were devoid of any merit and contrary to the factual
    reality.  Those conclusions of the 1996 Board were central to the trial judge’s
    analysis and deserve repetition here:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is clear from the evidence, indeed, from the
    Hospital’s own evidence, that there is no question as to Dr. Rosenhek’s
    professional competence.  It is equally clear that the revocation of his
    privileges cannot be justified by any reasonable concern over the quality of
    his patient care.  In the end, the Hospital’s case comes down to the allegation
    that Dr. Rosenhek just did not fit in.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But a hospital is not a fraternity, and fraternity
    notions of “fitting in” do not apply.  The fact is that Dr. Rosenhek walked
    into a hornet’s nest, not of his own making, in the form of the Critical Care
    Unit initiative.  The very purpose of his recruitment by the Hospital left him
    on what turned out to be the losing side of the controversy.  It is probably
    the case that he displayed a degree of arrogance in respect of his training and
    skills that exacerbated the situation … There can be little doubt that the lack
    of coverage faced by Dr. Rosenhek and the Hospital’s utter failure to take any
    steps, other than lip service, to assist in the resolution of that problem,
    further exacerbated the situation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All that having been said, however, whatever the
    contributing factors to the alleged interpersonal problems may have been, the
    overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the problems were minor and
    certainly not such as to justify the extreme measure of revocation of
    privileges.  When we are examining the question of ‘fitting in”, this Board
    must take very seriously the testimony of the twelve nurses, eight physicians,
    seven patients and family members of patients and two medical secretaries, all
    of whom sang Dr. Rosenhek’s praises.  To be sure, hearings are not won or lost
    by counting the witnesses on each side.  But against the evidence called by Dr.
    Rosenhek, the only first-hand evidence we have of his alleged inability to work
    within the Hospital structure, to work with professional colleagues and staff
    is that of Dr. Mandal.  We find his evidence unconvincing. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the factual findings of the 1996 Appeal Board, it must be said
    that the Hospital had no basis on which to revoke Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges. 
    While a wrong decision, even a very wrong decision cannot be equated to a
    decision made in bad faith, a decision may be so clearly wrong on the merits as
    to provide some evidentiary support for a finding of bad faith.  We place this
    decision to revoke Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges in that category.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The timing and manner of the Board’s decision to revoke Dr. Rosenhek’s
    privileges also informs the bad faith finding.  The privileges were revoked in
    March 1989, when Dr. Rosenhek had a month remaining on those privileges.  His
    privileges had been renewed only two months earlier.  There is nothing in the
    record to suggest that anything had changed between January, when the Board
    renewed those privileges, and March, when it revoked them.  This about-face
    appears arbitrary and entirely unwarranted given that there was never any
    legitimate issue about Dr. Rosenhek’s competence as a physician or the need to act
    to ensure the safety of his patients.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not only was there no explanation for the timing of the revocation of
    the privileges, the manner in which Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges were revoked also
    suggests bad faith.  Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges were terminated effective
    immediately and he was told to leave the Hospital at once.  This conduct is
    difficult to understand in the face of Dr. Rosenhek’s acknowledged competence, absent
    bad faith.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence, and the findings of fact made by the 1996 Appeal Board,
    also point to the existence of an oblique or improper motive for the revocation
    of Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges.  This oblique motive permeates the conduct of the
    Hospital and is probably the most significant reason supporting a finding of
    bad faith by the Hospital.  As outlined above, Dr. Rosenhek found himself at
    odds with those specialists who had opposed the plans to establish a critical
    care unit.  That difference of opinion, and interpersonal differences, made Dr.
    Rosenhek an outsider who was not allowed to participate in the coverage group. 
    As explained in the reasons of the 1996 Appeal Board, Dr. Rosenhek did not “fit
    in”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hospital was not prepared to take an active role to resolve the
    coverage problems.  Dr. Mandal, the Chief of Medicine at the Hospital, was very
    much in the forefront of those who denied Dr. Rosenhek access to a coverage
    group.  The 1996 Board concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]t seems quite clear that a hospital does have an
    interest in ensuring appropriate coverage arrangements for physicians and that
    it has an obligation to interfere where such arrangements are not being made. 
    For a responsible member of the Hospital management, the Chief of the affected
    department [Dr. Mandal], not only to fail to intervene, but to be a major
    source of the problem is, in our view, intolerable.  While public hospital
    facilities are not public utilities available to all physicians for the asking,
    they are equally not the private preserves for those who are well and long
    established on staff.  All physicians granted privileges to make use of public
    hospital facilities have an obligation to conduct themselves so as to maximize
    the ability of the institution to deliver patient care.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found, albeit in the context of considering the tort of
    intentional interference with economic relations, that the Hospital’s
    “predominant purpose” in revoking Dr. Rosenhek’s privileges was to “resolve a
    perceived problem among specialists”.  No doubt, the revocation solved the
    coverage dispute.  However, in using its revocation powers for that purpose,
    the Board acted for an oblique and improper motive.  This motive provided
    perhaps the strongest evidence from which bad faith could be inferred.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, there was ample evidence before the trial judge to support
    his finding that the Board acted in bad faith.  That finding stands.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board, in bad faith, exercised its decision-making function for an
    ulterior purpose and not for the public good, in circumstances where it had to
    know that its conduct would likely injure the plaintiff.  We are satisfied that
    the tort of misfeasance in a public office was made out:  see <i>Odhavji Estate</i>,
    at paras. 26-32; <i>Three Rivers District Council v. Bank of England (No. 3)</i>,
    [2000] 2 W.L.R. 1220 (H.L.), at p. 1230.  We would not disturb the trial
    judge’s finding that the Hospital is liable to Dr. Rosenhek. <span

    639, <span lang=EN-US>argues that since Dr. Rosenhek failed to adduce readily
    available evidence to prove his damages, he ought to be awarded only nominal
    damages.  In <i>Martin</i>, Finlayson J.A. drew a distinction between damages
    that are difficult in nature to assess, an assessment that must be undertaken
    despite the need for “guess work”, and damages that are unproven due to a
    failure to adduce available evidence.  In the latter case, only nominal damages
    should be awarded.  </span></p>

    J.A. declined to award nominal damages based on insufficient support for the
    damage claim; instead, he referred the damages back to the trial judge on the
    grounds that the plaintiff had adduced enough evidence to prove a significant
    loss.  The principle appears to be that nominal damages are not appropriate
    where a substantial loss has been demonstrated, even if evidence proving
    quantum is lacking.</p>

    accounts, should have been produced in the normal course.  It was also the

    acknowledgment of the magnitude of Dr. Rosenhek’s loss.  We refer to his
    finding that from 1989 to 1996 Dr. Rosenhek’s previously lucrative practice was
    reduced and limited to walk-in clinics.  Furthermore, <span lang=EN-US>while,

    However, there is no evidence as to the income the doctor could have made by
    working full time at the hospital – for example, evidence concerning whether
    the Hospital would have had capacity for Dr. Rosenhek to sustain a full-time
    roster of patients.  Without such evidence, any award based on the assumption
