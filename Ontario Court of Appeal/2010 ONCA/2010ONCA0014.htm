  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent sold the appellant a coin car wash business for
    approximately $2 million and accepted a vendor take back mortgage for $1.472
  million in part payment of the purchase price. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;About a year after the transaction was completed, the appellant
    sued the respondent, claiming that the respondent had misrepresented the
    revenues that would be generated by the business and breached a warranty
    relating to a pylon sign. The respondent disputed the appellant's claims and
    counterclaimed for the amount owing on its mortgage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;On a motion for summary judgment brought by the respondent, the
    motion judge dismissed the appellant's action and granted summary judgment to
    the respondent for possession of the mortgaged premises and payment of the
    amount owing on the vendor take back mortgage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Although the appellant raises several issues on appeal, in essence
    it contends that the motion judge applied the test for granting summary
    judgment improperly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;We do not accept this submission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the appellant's assertion that the respondent misrepresented
    the car wash's business income, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale contained an
    entire agreement clause confirming that there were no representations,
    warranties, collateral agreements or conditions affecting the agreement other
    than as contained in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. The appellant deleted
    conditions in the contract providing for disclosure of financial statements for
    the car wash business and requiring that the appellant be satisfied with the financial
    statements.  Moreover, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale also provided that
    all representations would merge on closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Accordingly, in order to succeed with a claim for
    misrepresentation, the appellant  had to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial as
    to whether there had been a fraudulent misrepresentation. The motion judge
    properly considered the essential elements of a claim of fraudulent
    misrepresentation and concluded on all the evidence before him that there was
    no genuine issue for trial concerning whether several of the necessary prerequisites
    for such a claim were not met in this case. We agree with his conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Concerning the pylon sign, the appellant acknowledges that the
    sign was installed after closing and that only the foundation for the sign was
    constructed prior to closing. On the record before him, the motion judge was
    correct to conclude that there was no evidence to support the appellant’s claim
    that the respondent had breached any representation or warranty contained in
    the closing documents – including the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and the
    vendor’s Statutory Declaration – regarding the sign and the lease for the sign. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, the appellant acknowledged that the motion judge made no
    error in relation to the expropriation issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The costs of the appeal and the motion for security for costs are
    awarded to the respondent on a substantial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount
    of $12,000.00, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
