  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The respondent's first trial date
    was set for the January 30, 2008. On that date, all Crown witnesses were present
    and the Crown was ready to proceed. However, the respondent asked for and was
    granted an adjournment to permit him to retain counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A second trial date was eventually
    set for July 23, 2008.</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>A part-time Crown (not Mr. Reitz or Mr. Clark) was
    assigned to the case. According to her submissions made to the presiding judge
    on July 23, she discovered, on the preceding day, that she had previously acted
    for the respondent.</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>There is no dispute that, after she arrived at the
    courthouse for the trial, she immediately advised counsel for the respondent of
    her difficulty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>When court opened on July 23, 2008
    Crown counsel inquired of opposing counsel whether their discussions should
    continue. Counsel responded, &quot;Well, I'd like to know, first, if the Crown
    is prepared to proceed with its case today?&quot; Crown counsel asked for an
    opportunity to confer with the involved police officers. When court resumed,
    Crown counsel advised that there had been a mix-up concerning the need to
    subpoena a civilian witness, with the result that the witness was not present.
    Crown counsel then asked for an adjournment. She also informed the court that
    there was one other matter she might have to address, depending on the ruling
    on her adjournment request.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The presiding judge refused the requested
    adjournment. Crown counsel advised the court she was still prepared to proceed
    with the witnesses she had. However, she indicated that she was required to
    renew her adjournment request in any event because she faced a potential
    conflict if it became necessary to cross-examine the respondent on a pending <i>Charter</i> application, because he was a former client. She said she had not revealed this
    problem earlier out of concern that the disclosure of this information would reveal
    certain of the respondent’s antecedents, thereby prejudicing him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At that point, counsel for the
    respondent abandoned the pending <i>Charter</i> application. Further
    discussions ensued in which respondent's counsel indicated that, prior to
    hearing the Crown’s case, he was not prepared to elect whether the respondent
    would testify. Crown counsel also indicated that she had tried unsuccessfully
    to secure the attendance of another Crown. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Following these discussions, the presiding
    judge decided to adjourn the case.  Respondent's counsel then said that his
    client had instructed him that he would not testify and asked that the matter
    proceed. The presiding judge declined to revisit his ruling.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In a subsequent scheduling
    discussion, respondent's counsel advised he would be seeking costs against the
    Crown based on the wasted time arising from Crown counsel's failure to seek an
    adjournment immediately based on her conflict of interest. In the light of this
    comment, the presiding judge expressed the view that the matter should proceed
    before another judge. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial eventually resumed
    before Flaherty J. on December 8, 2008. In addition to requesting costs,
    respondent's counsel applied for a stay of proceedings based on abuse of
    process. In support of that application, the respondent filed an affidavit in
    which he expressed the view that Crown counsel was untruthful when she said on
    July 23rd that she was prepared to proceed with the trial with the witnesses
    she had even though her initial adjournment request was denied.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span style='line-height:200%'>Ruling on the Stay
    Application and the Request for Costs</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The submissions and ruling on the
    stay application were brief. In his ruling, the trial judge observed that it
    would have been disheartening for the respondent to see his former lawyer
    appear as Crown counsel and argue for his conviction by requesting the initial
    adjournment.</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge described Crown counsel's conduct as
    &quot;an unforgiveable breach of solicitor\client duty&quot; and held that, in
    the circumstances, it would be an abuse of process for the Crown to continue
    the prosecution.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concerning costs, the trial judge
    held that Crown counsel’s failure to disassociate herself from the prosecution
    immediately on learning of her conflict was exactly the kind of exceptional
    conduct that would justify an award of costs against the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge further said it
    was known on July 23, 2008 that the chief Crown witness had not been subpoenaed
    and that the Crown could not prove its case had the matter proceeded.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the trial judge’s view, by
    failing to disassociate herself from the prosecution and by failing to find
    another prosecutor to take on the case, Crown counsel put the respondent in the
    untenable position of enabling the Crown to secure an adjournment so it could re-subpoena
    its witness and convict him if he objected to Crown counsel's conflict of
    interest. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span style='line-height:200%'>Analysis</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the trial judge made
    at least two significant errors that taint his conclusions on both the stay of
    proceedings and the costs award. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, he made a palpable and
    overriding error in finding that the Crown could not prove its case following
    the denial of Crown counsel's initial adjournment request. Second, he failed to
    advert to and apply the legal principles governing the circumstances in which a
    stay of criminal proceedings may be granted. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concerning the first error, there
    was no evidence in the record on the stay application capable of supporting a
    finding that the Crown would have been unable to prove its case in the absence
    of the civilian witness. The respondent's opinion in that respect was of no
    probative value. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>If anything, the respondent’s
    evidence filed on the stay application supported the conclusion that the Crown
    had a viable case without the civilian witness. The respondent acknowledged in
    his affidavit that the Crown disclosure indicated that at least one police officer
    had observed a hand-to-hand transaction between the respondent and the civilian
    witness; had confiscated cocaine from the civilian witness; and had discovered
    $50 on the respondent's person. The police officer's evidence concerning these
    matters, if given as anticipated and if accepted, was capable of supporting a
    conviction. Accordingly, although the civilian witness’s evidence was material,
    the fact that she was unavailable to testify that the respondent sold her the cocaine
    was not fatal to the Crown's case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although the trial judge did not
    refer explicitly to this finding in his ruling on the stay application, he did
    refer to the civilian witness as being the chief witness for the Crown. In my view,
    this was the only viable underpinning of the trial judge's conclusion that
    there was an abuse of process.  It is only if one assumes that the Crown could
    not prove its case on July 23, 2008</span><span style='line-height:200%'> given
    the absence of the civilian witness</span><span style='line-height:200%'> that
    there was any prospect for real prejudice to the respondent arising from the Crown's
    conduct in this matter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In that regard, Mr. McCue does not
    allege that Crown counsel acted for him previously in a matter related to this
    one or that Crown counsel possessed confidential information directly relevant
    to this matter, such that Crown counsel was prohibited absolutely from acting
    against him in this case: see Rule 2.04(4) of the <i>Rules of Professional
    Conduct</i> and related commentary. In fact, Mr. McCue’s conduct in withdrawing
    his <i>Charter</i> application and in indicating he would not testify so the
    trial could continue on July 23, 2008 belie this suggestion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although I agree that it may have
    been preferable had Crown counsel informed the trial judge of her potential
    conflict immediately on July 23, 2008, at its highest, her failure to do so was
    an error in judgment. Moreover, I see no evidentiary basis for characterizing
    it, as the trial judge did, as “an unforgiveable breach of solicitor\client
    duty.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concerning the second error, the trial
    judge failed to reference any of the legal principles applicable on an
    application to stay criminal proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A judicial stay of criminal proceedings
    is a remedy reserved for the clearest cases of abuse where either: </span></p>

    of the type of prosecutorial conduct that would warrant the extraordinary
    remedy of a stay of a criminal proceeding. Once the trial judge’s finding that
    Crown counsel placed the respondent in an untenable position is removed, there
    is simply no basis for a finding of abuse of process. In these circumstances,
    it follows that there is also no basis for making an award of costs against the
    Crown.</span></p>
