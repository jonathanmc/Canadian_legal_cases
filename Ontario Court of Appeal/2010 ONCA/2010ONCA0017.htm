  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to review and set aside the order of Cronk J.A.
    dated 29 October 2009, ordering him to post security for costs of $40,000
    ($30,000 for trial costs and $10,000 for potential costs of appeal) in order to
    proceed with his appeal.  The motion judge’s order was made under rule
    61.06(1)(a), which provides that where it appears there is good reason to
    believe that the appeal is frivolous and vexatious and that the appellant has
    insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal, security for
    costs may be ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends the motion judge erred by concluding that there
    is good reason to believe that the appeal is frivolous and vexatious and by
    drawing an inference from the trial judge’s reasons that the appellant had
    insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the order should be set aside.  We do so because the second
    paragraph of rule 61.06(i)(a) has not been met.  The onus of demonstrating that
    there is good reason to believe that the appellant has insufficient assets in
    Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal is on the moving party.  In this case,
    neither party filed any evidence respecting the appellant’s financial
    situation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching her conclusion that the appellant lacks sufficient assets to
    pay the costs of the appeal, the motion judge relied on various comments made
    by the trial judge in her reasons.  The comments, however, all related to the
    appellant’s need for cash in the 2006 time period, not to late 2008 when the
    trial took place, or to late 2009 when the security for costs motion was argued.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, because someone is experiencing cash flow difficulties does
    not, in our view, necessarily translate into that person not having assets. 
    The cash flow difficulties do indicate financial problems and, in some
    circumstances, might signal that the person has no assets to liquidate in order
    to resolve the cash flow problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, however, there was evidence that the appellant owned
    substantial assets.  The trial judge’s reasons set out that the appellant was
    growing the business he jointly owned with the respondent and that in the
    2006-2007 period the appellant owned 18 of the 33 Automatic Banking Machines
    used by the business.  The record also shows that in March 2008, the appellant
    purchased the respondent’s interest in the business for $120,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although, as noted by the motion judge, the source of the funds for the
    purchase of the respondent’s interest is not known there is nothing in the
    record to suggest that the appellant does not now own all or at a minimum 50%
    of the business and several automatic banking machines.  On this record,
    therefore, we necessarily conclude that the respondent has not met the onus on
    her to demonstrate that the appellant does not have assets in Ontario
    sufficient to pay the $10,000 costs of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant brought a motion to introduce fresh evidence on the
    review.  Because we would set aside the order for security for costs, it is
    unnecessary to consider the fresh evidence.  The appellant’s motion to
    introduce fresh evidence is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, we set aside the order for security for costs. We reserve
    the issue of costs of the initial motion and of the review to the panel hearing
    the appeal.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MacPherson J.A. (Dissenting):</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not agree with my colleagues’ analysis or conclusion
    on this motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party submits that Cronk J.A. erred by inferring, rather than
    explicitly finding, that he had insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the
    respondent’s costs of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The motion judge held that “[t]he record also supports
    Miller’s claim that Taylor lacks sufficient assets to pay the costs of the
    appeal should his appeal ultimately fail.”  She then reviewed the record in a
    thorough fashion that amply supports this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that most of the evidence relied on by the motion judge in
    making her order related to the appellant’s financial situation at the time of
    the trial in 2006.  However, the motion judge was aware of this limitation in
    the evidence; she put her conclusion no higher than that the observations and
    findings by the trial judge “paint a strong picture of financial fragility and
    greed on Taylor’s part.”  The motion judge then continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I note that at trial, Taylor did not dispute his money
    troubles.  He did not adduce evidence at trial (or before me) to challenge the
    assertion that he lacks financial resources.  Nor do his grounds of appeal
    attack this assertion or the trial judge’s comments concerning his financial
    position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can see no error in this reasoning; it permits the inference that the
    motion judge drew, namely, that in October 2009 it appears that the appellant
    had insufficient assets to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the sake of completeness, I would record that I see no error in the
    motion judge’s conclusion that there is good reason to believe that the appeal
    is frivolous and vexatious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the motion to set aside the order for security for
    costs.</p>
