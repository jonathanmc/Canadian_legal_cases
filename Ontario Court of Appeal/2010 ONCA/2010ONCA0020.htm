style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the decision of the Summary Conviction
    Appeal Court Judge dismissing his appeal from conviction for dangerous operation
    of a motor vehicle pursuant to s. 249(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46.  If leave is granted, he seeks a stay of his driving prohibition,
    pending appeal.  The applicant also seeks leave to appeal his sentence on the
    basis that the trial judge rejected a discharge prior to submissions and the
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ought not to have dismissed his sentence
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant acknowledges that in order for leave to be granted
    pursuant to s. 839 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, he must raise a question of law,
    and the legal issue raised must have significance for the administration of
    justice beyond this specific case.  An assessment of the merits of the appeal informs
    the analysis because, at least since <i>R. v. R. (R.) </i>(2008), 90 O.R. (3d)
    641 (C.A.), this court has adopted an approach similar to that taken by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in applications for leave to appeal indictable offences:
     see e.g. <i>R. v. Pea </i>(2008), 93 O.R. (3d) 67 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of law submitted is whether both the judge at first
    instance and the Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge failed to consider the
    issue of “moral blameworthiness” in the applicant’s conduct and also failed to
    consider if the applicant was aware of the risk and the danger manifested by
    his conduct.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
     </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The applicant submits that although the trial judge said he disbelieved
    the accused, he conducted no analysis of whether he was aware of the risk his
    conduct posed or whether a reasonable person in the applicant’s circumstances
    would be considered “morally blameworthy”.  For the reasons that follow, I
    would dismiss the application. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge found the trial judge had
    directed himself appropriately and had considered all the circumstances,
    including those raised by the defence and the central issue of the “relatively
    recent introduction to a medication which can cause drowsiness.”  In essence,
    she dismissed the applicant’s appeal essentially for the reasons given by the
    trial judge.  Thus, the trial judge’s reasons are the focus here.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence was that the applicant’s car crossed the centre line on approximately
    six occasions as he was approaching Port Hope on Highway #2 and took place over
    as much as four or five kilometres.  In his reasons, the trial judge began by
    quoting <i>R. v. Beatty</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, which set out the test for the <i>actus reus </i>of dangerous driving.  The trial judge held that, viewed objectively,
    the fact the applicant failed to confine his vehicle to its own lane of travel
    was dangerous to other persons using the highway.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then dealt with the <i>mens rea </i>required for the
    offence.  Before him, as before this court, the decision in <i>Beatty </i>was central
    to the submissions respecting the required <i>mens rea. </i> In that case, the
    court discussed the mental element required for the offence at length.  I
    reproduce the following pertinent excerpts, found at paras. 33, 37, 40 and 43
    of Charron J.’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[33]     The Court in <i>Hundal, </i>however, made
    it clear that the requisite <i>mens rea </i>may only be found when there is a
    “marked departure” from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in
    the circumstances of the accused. This modification to the usual civil test for
    negligence is mandated by the criminal setting.  It is only when there is a
    “marked departure” that the conduct demonstrates sufficient blameworthiness to
    support a finding of penal liability. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[37]     The underlying premise for finding fault
    based on objectively dangerous conduct that constitutes a marked departure from
    the norm is that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have
    been aware of the risk posed by the manner of driving and would not have undertaken
    the activity. <span style='color:black'>However, there will be circumstances
    where this underlying premise cannot be sustained because a reasonable person
    in the position of the accused would not have been aware of the risk or,
    alternatively, would not have been able to avoid creating the danger. Of
    course, it is not open to the driver to simply say that he or she gave no
    thought to the manner of driving because the fault lies in the failure to bring
    to the dangerous activity the expected degree of thought and attention that it
    required. As Cory J. explained (at p. 885 of <i>Hundal</i>):</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>It would be a denial of common sense for a
    driver, whose conduct was objectively dangerous, to be acquitted on the ground
    that he was not thinking of his manner of driving at the time of the accident.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>However, because the
    accused's mental state is relevant in a criminal setting, the objective test
    must be modified to give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt about
    whether the reasonable person would have appreciated the risk or could and would
    have done something to avoid creating the danger. On these occasions, even when
    the manner of driving viewed objectively will clearly be dangerous, the accused
    cannot be convicted. Cory J., in <i>Hundal</i>, gave some useful examples (at
    p. 887):</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Take for example a driver who, without prior
    warning, suffers a totally unexpected heart attack, epileptic [page73] seizure
    or detached retina. As a result of the sudden onset of a disease or physical
    disability the manner of driving would be dangerous yet those circumstances
    could provide a complete defence despite the objective demonstration of
    dangerous driving. <i>Similarly, a driver who, in the absence of any warning or
    knowledge of its possible effects, takes a prescribed medication which suddenly
    and unexpectedly affects the driver in such a way that the manner of driving
    was dangerous to the public, could still establish a good defence to the charge
    although it had been objectively established</i>.<i> </i> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[40] ... The standard against which the conduct
    must always be measured is always the same – it is the conduct expected of the
    reasonably prudent person in the circumstances. The reasonable person, however,
    must be put in the <i>circumstances </i>the accused found himself in when the
    events occurred in order to assess the reasonableness of the conduct.  To
    reiterate the example used above, the reasonable person becomes the one who …. “in
    the absence of any warning or knowledge of its possible effects, takes a
    prescribed medication which suddenly and unexpectedly” causes him to drive in a
    manner that is dangerous to the public.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[43] ... The trier of fact must also be satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s objectively dangerous conduct was
    accompanied by the required <i>mens rea. </i> In making the objective
    assessment, the trier of fact should be satisfied on the basis of all the
    evidence, including evidence about the accused’s actual state of mind, if any,
    that the conduct amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that
    a reasonable person would observed in the accused’s circumstances.   Moreover,
    if an explanation is offered by the accused, then in order to convict, the
    trier of fact must be satisfied that a reasonable person in similar
    circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved
    in the conduct manifested by the accused. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the <i>mens rea</i>, set out above at para.
    43 of the <i>Beatty </i>decision,<i> </i>of the appellant’s conduct. That
    summary does not mention moral blameworthiness. It does, however, restate that
    the trier of fact must be satisfied that, “a reasonable person in similar
    circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved
    in the conduct manifested by the accused.”</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the portion of his reasons dealing with <i>mens rea, </i>the trial
    judge discussed the circumstances of the applicant.  The trial judge rejected
    the applicant’s testimony that when he was driving on January 25, 2007, he
    could not “recall drifting or swerving out of his lane of traffic partially into
    the lane of oncoming traffic and back into his lane of traffic as he proceeded
    westbound along Highway Number 2 towards Port Hope.”  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge cited several reasons for rejecting the applicant’s
    evidence.  Among them was the fact that the applicant admitted he would have
    read the cautionary document indicating that the drug he was taking may make him
    dizzy or drowsy.  The trial judge also adverted to the evidence of two
    independent witnesses.   One described the movements of the applicant’s vehicle
    as gradual and, the other witness, as drifting.  He noted both descriptions were
    consistent with a dizzy or drowsy state of mind, the symptoms about which the
    applicant had been warned.  In so doing, the trial judge was adverting to the
    applicant’s awareness of the risk and that his conduct was neither without
    knowledge of the possible effects of the medication, nor sudden without time to
    react to his state and consider the risk.  The trial judge implicitly found the
    applicant was aware of the risk created by his conduct and its danger.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The trial judge referenced the standard of care expected of a
    reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused.  The trial judge
    concluded that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, “a reasonably
    prudent driver in Mr. Purvis’ circumstances that day, at the very least would
    have pulled over off the road, stopped and not continued towards Port Hope.”  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons, read in context and as a whole, admit of no
    other conclusion than that he found the applicant’s conduct in continuing to
    drive was a marked departure from the standard of care required of a reasonable
    person in similar circumstances to the applicant. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, this application has no merit. The trial judge’s reasons
    do not disclose an error in his application of the legal standard to the facts.
     The trial judge did not, as counsel submits, simply reject the applicant’s
    evidence and then convict him.  Instead, he considered both the applicant’s
    awareness of the risk and the standard of care expected of a reasonable person
    in his circumstances.  While the trial judge did not expressly say that the
    applicant’s conduct was morally blameworthy, he did not have to do so.   The
    trial judge’s reasons sufficiently indicated that he convicted on the basis of
    a combination of a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably
    prudent person in the applicant’s circumstances, coupled with the applicant’s
    awareness of the risk.  These were the two factors in the Supreme Court’s
    summary of the <i>mens rea </i>requirement articulated at para. 43 of <i>Beatty</i>.
     Combined, they amount to morally blameworthy conduct.    </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I see no significance to the administration of justice respecting the
    proposed appeal from conviction. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant also seeks leave to appeal the dismissal of his sentence
    appeal from the Summary Appeal Court Judge to this court on the basis that the
    trial judge prematurely rejected a discharge prior to submissions.  The
    applicant does not have a free standing right to apply for leave to appeal
    sentence from the Summary Conviction Appeal Court to this court.  The sentence
    may only be appealed to the Court of Appeal with leave of the court on a
    question of law alone: see <i>R. v. Bevis </i>(2000), 188 N.S.R. (2d) 163 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that the trial judge foreclosed submissions
    respecting a sentence of a conditional discharge prior to hearing submissions because
    he said there would be a conviction prior to hearing submissions. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks to elevate the trial judge’s slip of the tongue into
    an error of law.  I agree with the Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge that read
    as a whole, and with regard to the circumstances of both the appellant and the
    offences, the reasons of the trial judge indicate that he did not foreclose the
    availability of a discharge in advance of the input of counsel. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Days prior to being charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle,
    the applicant was charged with taking an automobile without the owner’s
    consent.  He received a conditional discharge for this offence.  In addition to
    the dangerous driving charge, the applicant was charged with failing to comply
    with a demand that he give a breath sample.  He was also charged with breach of
    his recognizance.  He pled guilty to these last two offences. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  While the trial judge indicated that convictions would be recorded,
    the Crown proceeded to make submissions against a discharge and, as one
    exchange during defence submissions indicates, counsel and the court turned
    their minds directly to the issue of the propriety of a discharge. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to not raising a question of law, the applicant’s
    application for leave to appeal sentence does not raise any issue of public
    importance.   </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the applications for leave to appeal conviction and a stay
    of the driving prohibition are dismissed, as is the application for leave to
    appeal sentence.  </p>

    and law. The Crown did not argue that the application did not raise a question
    of law. I note that in <i>R. v. Araujo</i>,<i> </i>[2000] 2 S.C.R. 992, the
    Supreme Court held, at para. 18, that “if a question is about the application
    of a legal standard, that is enough to make it a question of law.”  For
    purposes of my decision I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the
    applicant has stated a question of law.    </p>
