  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant brings this motion to set aside the order of the registrar
    dismissing his appeal and to extend the time within which to perfect his appeal:
    see rules 61.13, 61.16(5) and 3.02 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The factors a court should consider in deciding whether to grant this
    type of motion are well-known.  They are: whether the applicant had an
    intention to appeal within the time for bringing an appeal; the length of the
    delay, and any explanation for the delay; any prejudice to the respondent
    caused by the delay; and the justice of the case.  This last factor is most
    important and requires a consideration of the merits of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this motion, the respondent concedes that the applicant had an
    intention to appeal.  The delay involved is approximately three months.  Although
    the respondent submits that the applicant has not provided a satisfactory
    explanation for the delay, I am satisfied that the delay is due to administrative
    errors in the court system.  In addition, it appears the applicant changed his
    address and, as a result, was initially unaware of what was transpiring.  The
    appellant did not intend to deliberately ignore or flaunt the rules.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent does not assert that any prejudice has been caused by the
    delay.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remaining consideration is the justice of the case, including the
    merits of the appeal.  The appellant does not have to convince me that he will
    succeed in his appeal.  In discussing the merits of the appeal, I am simply
    commenting on whether it has any real chance of success.  The applicant is the
    author of a book that was the subject of a book review published in an academic
    journal originating from outside of Ontario.  Some copies of the review are
    available in Ontario.  The applicant alleges that the review in question was
    defamatory of him and caused him economic loss and damage to his reputation. 
    The respondent on this motion, The Board of Trustees of and for the University
    of Illinois, <i>et. al.</i>, brought a motion seeking an order setting aside
    service <i>ex juris </i>upon them or, in the alternative, staying the action on
    the basis that Ontario was not a convenient forum for the hearing of the
    proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After considering the relevant factors concerning whether the litigation
    had a real and substantial connection with Ontario, the motion judge set aside
    service <i>ex juris.</i>  In the event that he had erred in his conclusion, the
    motion judge went on to consider whether Ontario was a convenient forum for
    hearing the proceeding and concluded it was not.  <i> </i></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant’s Notice of Appeal raises numerous grounds of appeal.  The
    main ground of appeal is that the application judge erred in law in holding
    that Ontario lacked jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> and that he erred in his
    analysis and his weighing of the relevant factors.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The crux of the applicant’s action, insofar as jurisdiction is concerned,
    is his allegation that he suffered damages in Ontario as a result of the
    publication of the book review.  The application judge commented, at paras. 12
    and 13 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Paulsson maintains that the defamatory nature of
    the book review at issue in this case has contributed to the fact that he has
    been rejected as a candidate for academic jobs in Canada and elsewhere although
    he admits that since June 2004 the subject of the book review has not been
    raised in the course of any job application or interview and much the same
    criticism as he points to as defamatory in this case has been published by a
    man who is the chair of the history department at the University of Ottawa.  As
    well, he testified that he believes his age, now more than 62 years, has
    adversely affected his efforts to secure an academic or teaching career, both
    before and after the publication of the book review.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Paulsson asserts that for an academic who lacks the
    protection of a tenured post, his reputation is his only valuable possession
    but there is precious little evidence available on this application to describe
    Paulsson’s reputation in Ontario generally or the nature and extent of the
    impression upon it worked by the publication of his book and/or any negative
    review of the book.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also took into consideration Paulsson’s evidence
    that he did not believe any witnesses were needed on the liability issue, that
    he might retain an accounting expert and might call one or two doctors to
    testify on the damages issue.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also considered each of the other factors he was
    required to take into account in determining whether the litigation had a real
    and substantial connection with Ontario.   </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the state of the record before the application judge, and the lack
    of any apparent error in principle on his part, I am of the opinion that the
    appeal does not have any real chance of success.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the motion to set aside the registrar’s order and to extend
    the time within which to perfect the appeal is dismissed.   </p>
