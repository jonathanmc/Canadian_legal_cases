style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The overarching issue on this appeal is whether
    the trial judge erred in law in upholding the parties’ prenuptial agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>This is our discussion of the issues
    raised by the appellant and our disposition of them. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Did the application judge err in holding that adequate
    financial disclosure had been made pursuant to s. 56(4)(a)? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant makes three
    submissions in this regard: (1) the respondent failed to make full disclosure; (2)
    the lawyer who gave the appellant independent legal advice was not in a
    position to advise her properly because he did not have sufficient information
    about the respondent’s financial position; and, (3) the legal advice the
    appellant received was not independent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that, in the
    circumstances, the respondent’s disclosure was adequate.  The draft agreement
    had attached to it a schedule of assets and their values.  In addition, as the
    appellant was involved in the respondent’s business as a bookkeeper and real
    estate manager, the trial judge found she had full access to the books of the
    company and knew well his and its financial position.  We would not give effect
    to the argument that there was inadequate financial disclosure.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant also makes the novel
    argument that, even if the appellant were aware of the respondent’s financial
    circumstances, the lawyer who gave her independent legal advice was not and,
    therefore, he could not properly advise her.  In our opinion, the lawyer was in
    a position to tell the appellant that the respondent had considerable assets as
    indicated on the schedule attached to the draft of the contract. In the event
    of separation she would not share in them by way of an equalization payment
    except with respect to the matrimonial home which was a provision inserted at
    her request. The appellant’s lawyer told her what the legal effect of the
    document was and, having regard to our conclusion above, the appellant
    appreciated its effect on her particular situation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that Mr.
    Weir, the lawyer who advised the appellant, had a conflict of interest because
    he had acted for the respondent on many occasions with respect to his business
    dealings and, as a result, the advice given was not independent.  Mr. Weir
    testified at trial about his legal advice and explanations to the appellant
    before she signed the contract.  It does not appear that the allegation of
    conflict of interest was put to him in cross-examination.  However, the
    appellant submits he asked Mr. Weir about the extent to which he had acted for
    the respondent and his companies and made the submission that Mr. Weir had a
    conflict. The trial judge found, however, that Mr. Weir urged the appellant to
    seek advice from another lawyer besides himself but she declined to do so
    preferring to receive advice from him.   In addition it appears that the
    appellant may have consulted another lawyer prior to her last attendance on Mr.
    Weir. The appellant does not suggest what was deficient in the advice received
    as a result of the alleged conflict. We would therefore not give effect to this
    submission.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In all the circumstances, the
    trial judge was satisfied that the appellant knew she was giving up her rights
    to an equalization of net family property.  That conclusion was open to her on
    the evidence and we cannot interfere with it. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Should the marriage contract be set aside pursuant to s.
    56(4)(c) of the <i>FLA</i> on the grounds that the appellant signed the
    agreement under duress?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that there was no
    credible evidence to support the allegation that the appellant was under
    duress. Further, to the extent the appellant may have felt she was under
    duress, that pressure did not emanate from the respondent.  We would not give
    effect to this argument.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Did the respondent’s actions after the marriage constitute
    such a different state of affairs that the marriage contract should be set
    aside pursuant to the test applied by the Supreme Court in <i>Miglin v. Miglin</i>?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the appellant cooperated in the various
    transactions and, as noted by the trial judge, the appellant agreed at trial
    that there was no financial detriment to her. This ground of appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Should the memorandum prepared by Ms. DeSante have been
    admitted under s. 35(2) of the <i>Evidence Act</i> as a contemporaneous
    document? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s finding that the
    appropriate test for admissibility was met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.
    Costs in the amount of $11,500 all inclusive are awarded to the respondent from
    the appellant’s share of funds being held in trust. </span></p>
