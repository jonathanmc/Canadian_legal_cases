  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent pled guilty to seven sexual offences against children,
    including two counts of sexual assault of his four-year old daughter, three
    counts of making child pornography using his four-year old daughter, one count
    of possession of child pornography and one count of distributing child
    pornography. The horrific details will be described below, but the culminating
    act was a live sexual assault of his daughter transmitted by webcam in an
    internet chat room set up for pedophiles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The respondent spent
    14 months in pretrial custody pending the plea and pronouncement of sentence.
    The trial judge imposed a sentence of 20 months after the pretrial custody
    which was counted as 28 months, plus three years probation. The Crown asked for
    a sentence of seven years at trial (including pretrial custody), and says on
    appeal that the range for these offences is seven to ten years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      In my view, the
    sentence imposed was manifestly unfit and the appeal must be allowed.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2005, law enforcement officials began an investigation of a world-wide
    internet chat room created to facilitate the exchange of child abuse images and
    films among its members. The investigation revealed that children were being
    abused in order to create new child pornography images for the specific purpose
    of the room. Over the course of the investigation, 82 members were arrested and
    over 30 children who had been sexually abused were rescued. The respondent
    became a member of this chat room some time before March 2006, when the chat
    room was closed down by law enforcement. The respondent was not one of the
    people arrested during this first major takedown, but he knew that the chat
    room had been disabled by the authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, when the chat-room was resurrected, the respondent
    re-joined the chat-room group using a different “nickname”. On October 29, 2006
    he initiated an on-line conversation with an undercover police officer who was
    posing as an adult pedophile. The conversation lasted one hour and twenty-three
    minutes and was recorded by the police. The respondent began by transmitting
    147 child pornography images, describing them as a “sampling”. The officer
    asked if the respondent had his own children and if he was active with them.
    The respondent told him he had two daughters, ages four and twelve and
    transmitted an image of his young daughter when she was three, exposing her
    genitals in the bathtub. While boasting about sexually assaulting his daughter
    by licking her privates on the day that photograph was taken, he transmitted an
    additional two nude images of his daughter. I note here that these boasted acts
    did not form the basis for any of the charges to which the respondent pled
    guilty. However, they form part of his conduct in the chat room with the person
    he believed was a pedophile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The respondent then transmitted eight photos depicting sexual assaults
    on his daughter that took place on January 19, 2006. His hand is shown exposing
    the child’s private parts or rectum to the camera while her legs are spread or
    she is bent over. These photos formed the basis for the charges of sexual
    assault and making child pornography.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer then asked if the respondent had pictures from another day.
    In response, the respondent transmitted seventeen more pictures of his daughter
    taken on October 24, 2006, exposing her vagina or rectum, and, in several cases
    she is touching her vagina. These acts constituted the basis for another count
    of making child pornography.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of the conversation where the respondent asked the officer
    if he was “wanking over [his] little girl”, the respondent disclosed his
    daughter’s real name and transmitted twelve more photos. He then described how
    he laid his daughter on his bed after her bath, put a towel over her head and
    licked her for five minutes while he “beat off”. He explained that he decided
    to sexually abuse his daughter after receiving active encouragement by his
    on-line peers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the officer attempted to terminate the chat, the respondent said he
    had a surprise for the officer.  Then using the web-camera, he took and
    immediately transmitted three pictures of his daughter who was naked and bent
    over on the chair beside his desk while he was spreading open her labia and
    anus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was arrested that day, and his daughter was rescued by
    the authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also possessed DVD’s and CD’S containing 3454 child
    pornography photographs, 58 child pornography videos, 2096 child nudity images,
    10 child nudity videos, 1116 images of obscenity and 57 videos of obscenity (obscenity
    was agreed by the parties to be material where the dominant characteristic is
    the undue exploitation of sex or sex depicting crime, horror, cruelty or
    violence), including depictions of the respondent sexually abusing his
    daughter. Some of the images included children in bondage or engaging in
    explicit sexual activity. One was a naked girl, tied, gagged and bound hanging
    upside down with an object inserted into her vagina. Another showed a child
    lying on her back with the words “slut” and “cut me” written across her naked
    torso with red ink and a sharp knife-like instrument pointed at her exposed
    vagina. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Victim impact statements from the respondent’s wife and 12 year-old step-daughter
    revealed the terrible effect of the break-up of the family and the complete
    lack of trust caused by his acts. A statement was also filed by the mother of
    another child who appears in some of the photos. She describes the long-term
    effect on her daughter, knowing the pictures are a source of continuing
    exploitation, existing in the public domain forever.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was 35 years old at the date of sentencing. He had no
    criminal record. His education consisted of completion of grade 12 and one year
    of college. When the respondent married his wife, she already had a daughter.
    They then had their own child, the victim. The respondent and his wife
    separated shortly after his arrest. He was sentenced approximately 14 months
    after his arrest, all of which time was spent in pretrial detention, some of
    which was in protective custody. At the sentencing he expressed profound
    remorse, regret and shame.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown proposed a sentence of seven years in the penitentiary, less
    the time spent in pretrial custody, calculated as two-for one. The defence
    asked for a total sentence of 30 months, less time served.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge described the horror of the
    photographs, the actions of the respondent, the effect on the victims, the
    instigating effect of participating in a chat room with like-minded
    perpetrators, the permanence of sending images out on the internet and the
    effect of that permanence on the victims. He also doubted the sincerity of the
    respondent’s stated remorse, and noted that without any psychological or
    psychiatric assessment, he did not know whether the respondent was a pedophile
    and therefore the type of danger he presented to the public for the future. He
    took into account the guilty plea and the fact that the respondent did not have
    a record. He referred to the decision of Molloy J. in <i>R. v. Kwok</i>, [2007]
    O.J. No. 457 and to paragraph 7 where she listed the factors relevant to
    sentencing on charges involving possession of child pornography.<a name="2"></a><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><a href="#r2">[2]</a></span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge described this as a gross case, and a sickening case of
    breach of trust, noting that other cases he had read did not involve a
    perpetrator’s own daughter. He mentioned that the sentence had to reflect the
    need for general deterrence and denunciation and that totality was the most
    important factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then imposed a total sentence of four years minus time served, broken
    down as follows with the sentences to run concurrently: count 2, sexual
    assault: 12 months; count 3, making child pornography: 20 months; count 4,
    making child pornography: 20 months; count 6, possession of child pornography:
    18 months; count 7, making child pornography: 20 months; count 10, making child
    pornography: 20 months (this appears to be an error as the indictment lists
    count 10 as a charge of sexual assault); count 11, distributing child
    pornography: 20 months. The sentence also included three years probation with
    terms including counselling and an assessment for pedophilia.</p>
  <h3>Issue:  Is the sentence imposed too low for these offences and therefore
    manifestly unfit?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to determine a fit sentence, the sentencing judge must consider
    and assess the overall gravity of the offence or offences committed and the
    circumstances in which they were committed. This reflects the basic tenet of
    fairness that the punishment fit the crime. In his text, <i>Sentencing, </i>7<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2008), Clayton Ruby puts it this way at
    p. 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The nature or gravity of the offence is, properly,
    the central factor in sentencing. It is and must be the “first rule that
    prompts the magistrate”. Our basic notion of fairness demands that every
    sentence be primarily and essentially appropriate to the offence committed,
    having regard to the nature of the crime and the particular circumstances in
    which it was committed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are, of course, many other principles that must also be applied in
    order to arrive at a fit sentence for the particular offender in the specific
    case, including aggravating and mitigating factors, criminal record and the
    directives in s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the sentencing judge referred to many aspects of these
    offences that make them extremely serious transgressions calling for a
    significant penalty. However, in focusing on the totality principle, he failed
    to give sufficient weight or effect to the overall gravity of the course of
    conduct of the respondent and the cumulative circumstances that put his
    offences at the high end of moral culpability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the last two decades, courts have been on a learning curve to
    understand both the extent and the effects of the creation and dissemination of
    child pornography over the internet and to address the problem appropriately: see,
    for example,<i> R. v. Sharpe</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45;<i> Kwok</i>. A number of
    relatively lenient sentences had been imposed in cases where child pornography
    was downloaded or distributed, there was no sexual abuse or making of child
    pornography involved, and there were many mitigating circumstances: see for
    example, <i>R. v. Schan</i> (2002), 155 O.A.C. 273; <i>R. v. Weber</i> (2003),
    175 O.A.C. 138; <i>R. v. Kim</i> (2004), 181 O.A.C. 88. However, in cases that
    involved making child pornography and child sexual abuse, significant custodial
    sentences were imposed: see, for example, <i>R. v. Jewell; R. v. Gramlick </i>(1995),
    100 C.C.C. (3d) 270 (O.C.A.); <i>R. v. R.W.</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 2810.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the incidence of this behaviour appears to be increasing
    and expanding as technology becomes more sophisticated, encouraging the
    production of child pornography and greatly facilitating its distribution. The
    victims are innocent children who become props in a perverted show, played out
    for an ever-wider audience not only of voyeurs but of perpetrators. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the respondent was sentenced, the Supreme Court of Canada
    delivered its decision in <i>R. v. L.M.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, upholding a
    sentence of 15 years for an accused who sexually assaulted his four year old
    daughter and used her and her friend for making child pornography, which he
    distributed for profit over the internet, and who also possessed a huge
    collection of other child pornography.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, LeBel J. made an important observation about the proper
    approach to sentencing in a situation involving multiple charges of sexual
    assault of a child and making, disseminating over the internet and possessing
    child pornography at para. 31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The judge also correctly understood the close
    relationship between the offences, the overall situation they gave rise to and
    the need to impose a global sentence suited to that situation. Viewed as a
    whole, the crime was complex. The offence of sexual assault was closely
    connected with three other offences of making, possessing and distributing
    child pornography that are subject to express sanctions under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. Each aspect of the offender’s conduct could be considered only in
    light of all these charges, viewed as a whole. As Judge Wilhelmy concluded, the
    global sentence was the crucial factor in determining the sentence in the case
    at bar.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to apply the Supreme Court’s global sentence approach to the
    facts of this case, the following are the significant connected circumstances
    of the respondent’s offences to be taken into account:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="ParaNO">1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was participating in a child pornography chat room with
      like-minded adults. </p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER"> 2.         People
      participating in the chat room traded child pornographic pictures.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER"> 3.         These
      pictures included depictions of sexual assaults as well as other violence and
      other demeaning aggression against victimized children. </p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">4.        Victim impact information from one of those children showed
      that the pictures were made currently, that is, they were not historical
      material just being re-circulated in cyber-space.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The participants discussed committing sexual assaults on children and
      encouraged other participants to do the same. The respondent acknowledged that
      it was this encouragement that caused him to act out his fantasies on his own
      child.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent sexually assaulted his own daughter on an ongoing basis.
      He was grooming her to participate in this activity by touching herself and
      posing for pictures.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s daughter was a captive victim under his care and
      control. The abuse was ongoing and escalating and further assaults and abuse
      were only prevented because he was caught.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the victim was the respondent’s own child is the most
      egregious breach of trust there can be.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent disclosed his daughter’s name to the other participant in
      the chat room, another extension of his breach of trust.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">10.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not only did the respondent transmit pictures of his daughter being
      sexually assaulted by him to a stranger over the internet, he escalated the
      nature and extent of the criminal activity level by assaulting her as a live
      show to another participant. Had the other person in the chat room not been an
      undercover officer, it is likely that such a situation could escalate into more
      aggressive and prolonged sexual activity with the other person encouraging the
      activity.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">11.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By his live assault of his daughter in front of his new “friend”, a
      person he believed to be a pedophile, the respondent was sharing his child as
      an object of pleasure for both men for a criminal purpose. This constitutes an
      entire new aspect of the nature of the abuse that underlies the crime of making
      and distributing child pornography. The trial judge found that the respondent
      enjoyed being able to show off his daughter.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER">12.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim impact statements show the long-term effect of all the
      aspects of this activity. Obviously sexual abuse of a child by a parent is
      likely to have a significant psychological effect on the child. However, the
      additional trauma is caused by the child knowing that her photos are out in the
      public domain where unknown numbers of people around the world may be able to
      access them, and, in this case, know the child’s name. It was unclear on the
      evidence whether anything transmitted in the conversation with the officer to a
      chat room that was immediately disabled could be available to be seen in the
      future. However, the victims have ongoing fear and uncertainty regarding what
      remains accessible on the internet and to whom. It amounts to ongoing
      psychological victimization of all the children involved.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This confluence of factors clearly required a very significant sentence
    to meet the sentencing objectives of general deterrence and denunciation as
    well as specific deterrence. While acknowledging many of these factors, the
    trial judge did not refer to the live broadcast as an act that raised the
    respondent’s conduct to a new level of criminality. Furthermore, by focusing on
    the totality principle and imposing concurrent sentences for each of the
    offences, the trial judge failed to address the interrelation of the crimes and
    the need for a sufficiently long global sentence to address the seriousness and
    moral blameworthiness of the respondent’s overall criminal conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the totality principle must always be considered when
    sentencing for multiple offences, the sentence imposed cannot thereby become
    inadequate to properly recognize the overall gravity of this conduct that
    victimizes children in the most horrendous way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge referred to the decision in <i>Kwok</i> for the principles to be applied in a case of possession of child pornography.
    However, the circumstances in that case were not at all similar to this case,
    and the sentence of 12 months, which Molloy J. stated to be in the middle of
    the applicable range, may have misled the trial judge in assessing the range of
    sentence applicable in the egregious circumstances found here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> By upholding the 15-year sentence imposed by the trial judge in <i>L.M.</i>,
    the Supreme Court made it clear that the range can reach well into the
    double-digit level, depending on the number of offences, and the confluence of
    circumstances that may exist in each case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this case called for a very significant sentence in order to
    adequately meet the essential sentencing objectives of denunciation and
    deterrence for this category of crimes. The effective sentence of four years
    imposed by the trial judge was, in these circumstances, manifestly unfit and in
    error.  However, because the trial Crown asked for a sentence of seven years,
    and the guilty plea was entered on that basis, I would not impose a sentence higher
    than 7 years on this appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Issue of Re-incarceration</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent had been on release for nine months at the time this
    appeal was heard. While the Crown was responsible for the delay in perfecting
    this appeal, the respondent was also pursuing a cross-appeal until that
    proceeding was abandoned in July 2009. The Crown appeal was heard at the end of
    October, 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fresh evidence was filed regarding the respondent’s progress in the
    community. This evidence shows that he is receiving treatment and making
    progress, that he is living on his own, and that he has had some employment. His
    therapist states that re-incarceration would be counter-productive to his
    rehabilitation progress.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In most cases, this court is reluctant to re-incarcerate an offender who
    has served the sentence originally imposed and has been released into the
    community: see, for example, <i>R. v. C.N.H</i>. (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 564
    (C.A.); <i>R. v. Mann</i>, [1995] O.J. No. 474 (C.A.). The factors referred to,
    Crown delay and the respondent’s progress in the community, would also militate
    against an order that would require the offender to be re-incarcerated: <i>R.
    v. Crazybull</i>, [1993] A.J. No. 473 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Banci</i>, [1982] O.J.
    No. 58 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, this is a case where the sentence imposed was so far below the
    sentence that was required and was “so inadequate that the interests of justice
    require the court’s intervention”: see <i>R. v. Cheng</i> (1991), 50 O.A.C.
    374, at para. 5.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal, set
    aside the sentence imposed of four years plus three years probation, and
    substitute a sentence of seven years. The respondent will of course be given
    credit for all time already served. A warrant may issue for the arrest of the
    respondent.</p>

    trial and on the appeal, respondent’s counsel objected that Crown counsel at
    trial had changed her position from the pretrial when she spoke to sentence,
    and that the Crown’s position at the pretrial was 5 years less time served in
    the case of a guilty plea and 5 years plus time served if the matter went to
    trial. Crown counsel stated to  McGarry J. that she had not changed her
    position. In his reasons McGarry J. stated that the Crown position was 7 years.
    On this appeal, the respondent has filed the pretrial summary sheet that may
    explain the misunderstanding. The Crown position with respect to the effect of
    pretrial custody on a guilty plea was 5 years, “subject to reduction (some)”,
    and after trial, it was 5 years with no reduction. By asking for 7 years at
    trial following the plea (i.e. 5 years plus 24 months), Crown counsel was
    reflecting “some  reduction”, 4 months,  for the pretrial custody of  28
    months. </span></p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span class="style1"><a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> </span>In <i>Kwok</i>, Molloy J. set out the following to be considered as aggravating
    factors: <span style='color:black'>(i) a criminal record for similar or related
    offences; (ii) whether there was also production or distribution of the
    pornography; (iii) the size of the pornography collection; (iv) the nature of

    depravity and violence depicted); (v) the extent to which the offender is seen
