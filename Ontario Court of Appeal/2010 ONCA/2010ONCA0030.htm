  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the imposition of a suspended
    sentence plus three years probation by Justice Nordheimer following a plea of
    guilty by the respondent to a charge of aggravated assault.  The respondent is an aboriginal offender.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Circumstances of the Offence
    and the Plea</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent and the victim were acquaintances.  They had an earlier altercation but had
    temporarily reconciled their differences until they found themselves together,
    along with the victim’s boyfriend, at a bar on March 8, 2008.  Ms. Peters, the respondent, had been drinking
    and during the conversation took offence at something the victim said.  She pushed the victim.  The scuffle escalated and the boyfriend
    intervened to attempt to separate the pair.  While he was doing so, the respondent lunged past him and swung the beer
    bottle she was holding at the victim’s head, breaking the bottle with the
    blow.  She then followed through with her
    swing in a downward motion with the broken bottle, causing two lacerations to
    the victim’s face that required 21 stitches to close.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nearly a year after the incident, the victim was still
    experiencing continuing pain in her left eye and face, headaches, left eyelid
    muscle spasms, and facial asymmetry.  The
    scars remain visible and may require plastic surgery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent pled guilty to aggravated assault after
    the preliminary hearing and after the complainant had testified at that
    hearing.  At the sentencing hearing, the
    Crown sought a custodial sentence of 12 to 18 months.  The defence suggested a suspended sentence
    followed by two years probation.  A
    conditional sentence was not open to the sentencing judge because the
    amendments to the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, in 2007 prohibit the granting of such a sentence where a
    serious personal injury offence – of which aggravated assault is an example –
    has been committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After considering all of the various factors involved
    and in particular, the <i>Gladue </i>report,
    the sentencing judge imposed a suspended three-year sentence with a lengthy
    series of probationary terms during that period.  The Crown now seeks to appeal that sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would not interfere with
    the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.  In brief, while the offence was serious and the antecedents of the
    respondent troubling, it was open to the sentencing judge to apply the <i>Gladue</i> principles as he did and to
    impose the sentence that he did.  I can
    find no error in principle in his reasoning nor – given the jurisprudence – can
    the sentence be said to be manifestly unfit.  In such circumstances, the sentencing judge’s sentencing decision is
    entitled to considerable deference and an appellate court ought not to
    interfere.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Circumstances of the Offender</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Peters was 26 years old at the time of her
    plea.  She does not have any prior
    criminal record as an adult, but has two prior convictions as a youth, one of
    which was for assault causing bodily harm.  The <i>Gladue</i> report revealed a
    difficult and disheartening upbringing in a home of violence and alcohol abuse.  Ms. Peters, herself, may be suffering from
    Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.  She has a
    history of abuse at the hands of her parents, of friends of her parents, and others,
    which started when she was three or four years of age.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Peters has problems with alcohol and with anger
    management, both arising out of her background.  She began to drink and experiment with drugs in her early youth, turning
    to crack dealing in her early twenties.  It is apparent, as the sentencing judge noted, that the confrontation
    leading to this offence was directly related to her consumption of alcohol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the last few years, however, Ms. Peters has managed
    to gain employment and has taken courses to improve her skills.  At the time of sentencing, she was working at
    a bank as a financial services representative but has apparently lost that
    position since the sentence was imposed.  The fresh evidence filed indicates that she continues to seek employment
    and is responding well to the guidance of her employment counsellors.  She is also compliant with the terms of her
    probation and, according to her probation officer, “reports with a positive and
    prosocial attitude.”  She has been
    referred to two substance use programs.  Ms.
    Peters works as a volunteer for the youth program at Aboriginal Services of
    Toronto and is reported to be “a very strong individual who is genuine and
    thoughtful” and who has “a gift in working with youth.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Applicable Principles of Sentencing</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of his reasons, the sentencing judge took
    into account all of the relevant principles of sentencing, including the
    provisions of s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> mandating the court to consider<i> </i>“<i>all available sanctions other than
    imprisonment</i> that are reasonable in the circumstances … <i>with particular attention to the
    circumstances of aboriginal offenders</i>” (emphasis added).  He was aware of, and cited, the direction of
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R v.
    Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 93(3), that s.&nbsp;718.2(e) is
    remedial in nature and is designed to ameliorate the serious problem of
    over-representation of Aboriginal people in prisons and to encourage sentencing
    judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to sentencing.  He took into account the fundamental purpose
    of sentencing set out in s. 718 of the <i>Code</i>,
    namely to contribute to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,
    peaceful and safe society” by the imposition of sanctions that incorporate the
    sentencing objectives of denunciation, deterrence, rehabilitation and the
    promotion of responsibility in offenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Papadopoulos argues firmly and ably, on behalf of
    the Crown, that the sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to give
    sufficient weight to the paramount principles of denunciation and deterrence.  However, when consideration is given to the
    appropriate principles – as it was here – the weight to be attributed to those
    principles in the balancing exercise is generally a matter attracting deference
    to the sentencing judge’s decision.  The sentencing
    judge not only referred to denunciation and deterrence in his general review of
    the applicable principles; he addressed those sentencing objectives <i>three</i> times during his consideration of
    the Crown’s position (which, incidentally, he acknowledged was “a reasonable
    one given the circumstances surrounding the offence”).  In addition, he recognized the <i>Gladue</i> and post-<i>Gladue</i> jurisprudence underscoring that s.&nbsp; 718.2(e)
    establishes a new methodology for approaching the sentencing of aboriginal
    offenders but does not necessarily mean aboriginal offenders will ultimately
    receive different sentences from other offenders, particularly for serious
    offences such as this one.  In
    particular, the sentencing judge addressed the statement of this Court in <i>R. v. W. (R.)</i> (2008), 239 C.C.C. (3d)
    47, at para. 31, and relied upon by the Crown: “In the case of serious and violent
    offences, even for aboriginal offenders, the balance will often tilt in favour
    of [deterrence, denunciation, and the need for social protection].”  See also <i>Gladue</i>,
    at paras. 79, 88, and 93(9); <i>R v.
    Kakekagamick</i> (2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 289, at para. 43 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the sentencing judge noted the theme running
    through some of the authorities to the effect that the objectives of
    denunciation and deterrence are not only met through the imposition of a term
    of incarceration: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>R v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at
    paras. 20 and 22; <i>R. v. Wismayer</i> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.), at p. 241-245.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end – after balancing all of the factors
    relative to sentencing an aboriginal person, and after taking into account the
    seriousness of the offence and the aggravating and mitigating factors relating
    to it, the contents of the favourable <i>Gladue</i> report he had before him, the victim impact statements, and the particular
    circumstances of this offender – the sentencing judge simply decided that a period
    of incarceration was not the appropriate disposition for this offender in
    relation to this crime.  He concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the end result, I am
    not satisfied that a period of incarceration is necessary either for the
    purpose of expressing denunciation or deterrence in this case.  Further, a period of incarceration manifestly
    fails to achieve the restorative purpose that is of particular importance in
    the case of Aboriginal offenders.  A
    period of incarceration would undoubtedly cause Ms. Peters to lose her job and
    then quite possibly set back the progress that she has made over the past few
    years.  At the same time, however, I
    appreciate that there needs to be some close supervision of Ms. Peters in an
    effort to ensure that she does not commit a further offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was open to the sentencing judge to come to this
    conclusion on the record before him.  To
    say that the balance will <i>often</i> tilt
    in favour of deterrence and denunciation in the case of serious and violent
    offences, as this Court did in <i>W<span
class=GramE>.(</span>R.)</i>, is not to say that it <i>always</i> will.  Neither <i>Gladue</i> nor its progeny establish that
    aboriginal offenders are to be sentenced to terms of incarceration in all cases
    of serious offences.  At the end of the
    day, as many authorities have noted, it remains for the sentencing judge to
    consider the case as a whole and to arrive at a sentence that is fit and just
    in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have read the draft reasons of my colleague, Justice
    Watt.  Respectfully, I am unable to
    accept – as he concludes – that the sentencing judge failed to give effect to
    the predominant principles of denunciation, deterrence, promotion of
    responsibility and acknowledgement of harm.  The sentencing judge gave very careful consideration to all of the
    principles of sentencing relating to aboriginal offenders, including the
    relevant jurisprudence (referred to above) and including the need to give
    effect to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence.  He was also alert to the need to promote
    responsibility in offenders for their actions, and said so explicitly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons he clearly expressed, and after
    addressing all of the pertinent principles and factors, the sentencing judge
    concluded that a period of incarceration was not necessary to meet the needs of
    denunciation and deterrence and indeed that it would be <span class=SpellE>courterproductive</span> to achieving the restorative purposes that are of particular importance in the
    case of Aboriginal offenders.  This he
    was entitled to do.  The <i>weight</i> to be given to the various
    sentencing factors – including whether incarceration was necessary to meet the
    objectives of denunciation and deterrence – was for him to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept that the sentencing judge
    misapprehended the evidence in any significant way that would open his decision
    to review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without any error in principle on the part of the sentencing
    judge, his decision is entitled to deference and we are not permitted to
    interfere.  As Lamer C.J. noted in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d)
    327, at paras. 91-92:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Put simply, absent an
    error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis
    of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a
    sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.  Parliament explicitly vested sentencing
    judges with <span class=GramE>a <i>discretion</i></span> to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A sentencing judge ... enjoys a position of
    advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the
    sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge
    also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having
    served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most
    importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community
    which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime. As such, the
    sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing
    goals that will be “just and appropriate” for the protection of that community.
    The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which
    attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the
    moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence,
    while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and
    in the community. The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be
    interfered with lightly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed
    was manifestly unfit.  In her factum, Ms.
    Papadopoulos submits that “[<span class=GramE>a]n offender, irrespective of
    descent, who violently swings a beer bottle at a female victim’s head,
    resulting in two serious gashes, ongoing pain, and facial scarring requiring
    surgery</span> must serve a custodial sentence.”  Respectfully, while such a result may often
    be the case, to say that an offender in such circumstances – particularly an
    aboriginal offender – <i>must</i> serve a
    custodial sentence is to state the sentiment too strongly, and is inconsistent
    with the <i>Gladue</i> jurisprudence and,
    indeed, the jurisprudence respecting sentencing generally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied on this Court’s recent decision in <i>R. v. Chickekoo</i>, 2008 ONCA 488, a case
    with some similarities to this case.  There, this Court upheld an 18 month sentence plus two years probation
    for an aboriginal female who broke a beer bottle over a victim’s head, leaving
    the victim permanently disfigured.  There
    are distinctions between the cases, however.  In <i>Chickekoo</i>, the injuries
    were more severe and the appellant’s adult criminal record was more pronounced.  In any event, the two cases provide an
    example of how sentencing judges can arrive at different decisions in the
    proper exercise of their sentencing discretion, depending upon the nuances of
    the circumstances.  I am not persuaded
    that the decision in <i>Chickekoo</i> leads
    to the conclusion that the decision of the sentencing judge here was manifestly
    unfit.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would accordingly grant leave to appeal sentence but
    dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>

    err in principle and did not impose a sentence that was manifestly unfit, my <span
class=GramE>colleagues</span> accord substantial deference to the sentencing
    decision and would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  In
    my view, the sentencing decision is cumbered by error and is manifestly
    unfit.  I would grant leave to appeal,
    allow the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed and substitute for it a
    sentence of imprisonment for 12 months followed by probation for three years on
    the same terms ordered by the sentencing judge.  My reasons for doing so follow.  </p>

    threw a glass of beer on the victim.  The

    prior to the assault that attracted the sentence under appeal, the victim had
    purchased two bottles of beer and one of water from the bar.  She returned to the table she shared with her
    boyfriend who was talking to the respondent.  The victim gave her boyfriend the bottle of water and the respondent one
    of the two bottles of beer.  The victim
    could not hear something the respondent said during the conversation at their
    table.  The victim said: “pardon”.  The respondent pushed the victim and the
    fracas was underway.  The record offers

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> </span>A brief elaboration on the
    circumstances of the respondent is in order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of sentencing, as now, the extent to which
    the respondent might suffer from the effects of <span class=SpellE>fetal</span> alcohol syndrome is unknown. No testing has been done. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is a chronic abuser of alcohol and has
    also consumed illicit drugs including ecstasy.  The mainstays of her abuse are alcohol and marijuana.  She has also trafficked in crack
    cocaine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a young offender, the respondent accumulated two
    prior convictions and a conditional discharge.  One conviction and the conditional discharge were for assault.  The assault conviction arose out of the
    termination of a dating relationship.  The respondent was upset.  She
    invited her former partner outside <span class=GramE>of a licensed premises</span> on the pretence that she wished to speak to him.  An adult friend of the respondent
    followed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once outside the bar, the respondent grabbed her former
    partner and began punching him in the head.  Her cohort, the adult, approached.  The respondent held the victim.  The adult cut the victim’s face with a sharp weapon, causing injuries
    that required seven stitches to close.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second assault for which the respondent received a
    conditional discharge involved the respondent’s mother.  The offence was committed while the
    respondent was on probation for the previous assault on her former boyfriend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent acknowledges that she has problems with
    excessive consumption of alcohol and management of her anger.  Details are sparse about her attendance at
    any programs that treat or provide counselling for alcohol abuse and anger
    management.</p>

    parties share common ground that, in cases of unprovoked violence against
    another person, the predominant sentencing objectives are denunciation and
    deterrence.  In this case, I would also
    assign a place of prominence to promotion of a sense of responsibility and an
    acknowledgement of the harm done to victims of unprovoked violence and to the
    community in which they live: <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 718(f).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    fundamental principle of sentencing is that the sentence imposed must be
    proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed and the degree of
    responsibility of the offender who committed it: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 718.1. This fundamental principle applies as much <span class=GramE>to</span> aboriginal offenders as it does to non-aboriginal
    offenders.  </span></p>

    offender of his or her liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate
    in the circumstances: <i>R. v. Proulx</i>,
    [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 17.  Sentencing judges are required to consider all available sanctions other
    than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances for all offences,
    but are required to give particular attention to non-<span class=SpellE>carceral</span> sentences for aboriginal offenders: <i>Criminal

lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is worth reminder that the words of s. 718.2(e) do not alter the fundamental
    duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit for the offence
    and the offender who committed it: <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Gladue</span></i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    33, 36.  A fit sentence is one that is
    proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed and the degree of
    responsibility of the offender who committed it and vindicates the applicable
    sentencing objectives, principles and factors.</span></p>

    aboriginal offenders differently so that a truly fit and proper sentence will
    be imposed in each case: <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at para. 33.  What s. 718.2(e) does is to
    alter the method of analysis that sentencing judges use to determine a fit
    sentence for aboriginal offenders.  Sentencing determinations must take cognizance of the <i>unique circumstances</i> of aboriginal
    peoples: <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at para. 75.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    does not follow from either s. 718.2(e) or <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> that, as a general
    practice, sentences imposed on aboriginal offenders must inevitably assign
    greatest weight to the principles of restorative justice and less weight or a
    subservient place to sentencing objectives like deterrence, denunciation and
    separation: <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at para. 78.</span></p>

    the difference in methodology mandated by s. 718.2(e) and <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> for aboriginal offenders,
    the more violent and serious the offence committed, the greater the likelihood
    that the terms of imprisonment imposed on aboriginal and non-aboriginal
    offenders will be close to or coincide with each other: <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    33, 79.  Section 718.2(e) and <span

    a sentencing alternative, probation is primarily rehabilitative, not punitive,
    assigning prominence if not exclusivity to the sentencing objective articulated
    in s. 718(d): <i>Proulx</i> at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 23, 32.  The
    failure to distinguish between sentences that are punitive, or at least have a
    punitive feature, and probation may result in the imposition of lenient
    sentences that fail to provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence and
    attract <span class=GramE>public  disapprobation</span>: <i>Proulx</i> at para. 30.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    constellation of factors satisfies me that this is not a case in which
    deference should be accorded to the decision of the sentencing judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the first place, the sentencing judge noted the absence of any previous failure
    by the respondent to comply with the terms of a probation order. In fact, when
    the respondent was arrested for an assault on her mother on August 25, 2001, an
    offence for which she received a conditional discharge on July 12, 2002, the
    respondent remained bound by the terms of a probation order made on September
    12, 2000, as a result of a prior conviction of assault.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    sentencing judge was also in error in his reference to the respondent’s prior
    experiences on probation in another respect. In addition to the periods of
    probation imposed when the trial judge suspended the passing of sentence after
    entry of convictions for possession of stolen property and assault, the
    respondent was also required to comply with a probation order when
    conditionally discharged for the assault on her mother in August 2001.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Secondly,
    in my view, the trial judge erred in failing to appreciate that, although the
    respondent’s aboriginal status mandated the application of a different
    methodology to the determination of a fit sentence, it did not alter the
    fundamental duty of the sentencing judge to impose a fit sentence compliant
    with the fundamental principle of proportionality and the governing sentencing
    objectives: <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 33, 75.  Section 718.2(e) does <i>not </i>require
    an automatic reduction of the sentence or a remission of a warranted period of
    incarceration simply because the respondent is aboriginal: <span class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at para. 88. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    offence the respondent committed here was a serious violent offence.  And not the first serious violent offence in
    which the respondent has participated.  <span
class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> teaches
    that generally, as a matter of practical reality rather than sentencing
    principle, particularly violent and serious offences will result in imprisonment
    for aboriginal offenders as often as for non-aboriginal offenders: <span
class=SpellE><i>Gladue</i></span> at para.
    33.  It is all the more so for
    recidivists.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    the trial judge failed to consider how yet another, a fourth term of probation,
    could vindicate the predominant sentencing objectives of denunciation and
    deterrence, not to mention promotion of a sense of responsibility and an
    acknowledgement of the harm done to the victim and to the community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    sentencing judge invoked the decision in <i>R.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Wismayer</span> </i>(1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.) to
    support his conclusion that the sentencing objectives of denunciation and
    deterrence can be sated otherwise than by the imposition of a sentence of
    actual imprisonment. But <span class=SpellE><i>Wismayer</i></span>,
    like <i>Proulx</i>, made this observation in
    response to and rejection of an argument that, unlike a sentence of actual
    imprisonment, a conditional sentence of imprisonment could not service the
    objectives of denunciation and deterrence.  The <i>Proulx </i>court concluded
    that a conditional sentence of imprisonment is punitive and capable of
    providing significant denunciation and deterrence: <i>Proulx</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 35, 41.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this case, as the sentencing judge pointed out, a conditional sentence of
    imprisonment was not an available sentencing option. Aggravated assault is a
    “serious personal injury offence” as defined in s. 752 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, thus cannot be the
    subject of a conditional sentence of imprisonment under s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    a general proposition, it is right to say, as the trial judge did, that a sentence
    of actual imprisonment is not the only sentencing alternative that can satisfy
    the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence.  A conditional sentence of imprisonment may
    also do so because it has a punitive ingredient.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But,
    as the <i>Proulx</i> court is careful to
    point out, what distinguishes probation from a conditional sentence of
    imprisonment is the absence from the former and presence in the latter of this
    punitive component. Probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing option,
    one that services the sentencing objective in s. 718(d).  It is the punitive aspect that distinguishes
    the conditional sentence of imprisonment, which like probation has a
    rehabilitative aspect, from probation: <i>Proulx</i> at para. 22.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    unavailability of a conditional sentence of imprisonment in this case cannot
    justify the imposition of a sentence that lacks a punitive component and fails
    to provide an adequate ration of denunciation and deterrence:  <i>Proulx</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 22, 23, 29, 30, 32, 99.  To achieve punitive objectives, like
    denunciation and deterrence, especially where aggravating circumstances are
    present, incarceration is generally the preferable sanction: <i>Proulx</i> at para. 114.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
    the sentencing judge erred in treating, as mutually exclusive, the sentencing
    options of probation and imprisonment. The alternative of a conditional
    sentence of imprisonment was unavailable, excluded by statute because of the
    character of the offence the respondent committed. But that did not leave
    probation alone or imprisonment alone as the only sentencing options.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    unavailability of a conditional sentence of imprisonment as a sentencing
    alternative seems to have driven the sentencing judge down to suspend the
    passing of sentence and impose a period of probation.  A conditional sentence of imprisonment, as <i>Proulx</i> instructs, combines punitive and
    rehabilitative features.  Its
    unavailability does not warrant imposition of a period of probation, a sentence
    that lacks any denunciatory or deterrent value and is not faithful to the
    fundamental principle of sentencing: proportionality.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the views of my colleagues, I am satisfied that the reasons of the
    sentencing judge reveal misapprehensions of relevant evidence (compliance with
    prior probation orders and the number of prior convictions or findings of
    guilt) and errors in principle (failure to give effect to the predominant
    principles of denunciation, deterrence, promotion of responsibility and
    acknowledgement of harm) and resulted in the imposition of a sentence for a
    serious and violent offence that is manifestly unfit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In
    the result, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the
    sentence imposed at trial and in its place substitute a sentence of
    imprisonment for 12 months to be followed by a period of probation for three
    years on the same terms as those imposed by the sentencing judge.  The term of imprisonment that I would impose
    is circumscribed by the position of Crown counsel on appeal and should not be
    taken as dispositive of the lowest end of the appropriate range of sentence for
    aggravated assault in circumstances such as these.</span></p>
