style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Should a party seeking <span style='line-height:200%'>leave to
    appeal to this court be entitled to file evidence directed at the issue of
    public importance?  The Minister of Transportation (the “MTO”) argues in the
    affirmative while 1520685 Ontario Inc. (“152”) says the opposite.  </span></p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The MTO planned to expand an existing highway into the Sudbury
    mining division.  By February 2003, the MTO had placed survey stakes into the
    ground, dug boreholes and cut vegetation along a proposed route.  Later that
    year, 152 staked its mining claim on lands that partially overlapped those
    surveyed by the MTO.  The MTO applied to Superior Court for a declaration that the
    company’s claims were invalid, or alternatively, that the company was a tenant
    of the Crown whose tenancy could be terminated upon notice.  The matter was
    transferred to the Mining and Lands Commission on consent in January 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The key question before the
    Commission was whether or not the lands were in the “actual use or occupation
    of the Crown” at the time the company staked its claim.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
    It concluded that the lands were not; the work performed by the MTO connoted
    preliminary planning and was not indicative of “actual use”.  In reaching this
    conclusion, the Commission noted that the MTO had not applied under s. 35 of
    the <i>Mining Act</i> to withdraw the land from prospecting. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The MTO appealed to the Divisional
    Court.  By an order dated October 16, 2009, the court upheld the decision as
    reasonable.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The MTO now seeks leave to appeal
    to this court.  It submits that the proposed appeal raises two issues of public
    importance: (1) what is the appropriate standard of review on an appeal as of
    right from a decision of an administrative tribunal, and (2) what is the proper
    interpretation of the words “actual use or occupation” under the <i>Mining Act</i>?</span></p>
  <h2><i>Background to the Motion</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The MTO served a Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal on October
    30, 2009.  As the deadline approached, the Motion Record had been served but
    the materials were not complete because the requisite factum had neither been
    concluded nor approved for service.  This, the MTO says, was due to the “press
    of other matters” and the internal requirements for approval. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As a consequence, the MTO found
    itself out of time to file its factum and motion record and brought a motion to
    extend the time for doing so.  On December 22, 2009, the MTO advised 152 that
    its materials were complete and that it may not be necessary to attend the
    motion, which was scheduled to be heard on December 29, 2009. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>152 took the position that it
    would be necessary to proceed with the hearing of the motion because the
    materials contained an affidavit of P. Lecoarer that “contained new evidence
    that was not before the Divisional Court”.  The MTO said the affidavit merely
    provides evidence of public importance, which is vital to obtaining leave in the
    circumstances of this case.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Given this disagreement, the
    hearing of the motion to extend time proceeded. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On the day that I heard this
    motion, the MTO advised that it had filed its materials for the motion for
    leave with this court, including its factum and the impugned affidavit of P. Lecoarer. 
    152 objects solely to the inclusion of the affidavit.  In all the
    circumstances, I instructed the MTO to remove its leave materials from the
    court until such time as I ruled on the admissibility of the affidavit. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I pause to point out that I have
    had only the benefit of oral argument without the assistance of a factum from
    either party.  I also note that there is little authority on the contentious
    issue, namely, the appropriateness of evidence of public importance on motions
    for leave to appeal.</span></p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 6(1)(a) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,<i> </i><a
name=reflex-statute-20739448>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43</a>, leave to appeal from a
    decision of the Divisional Court will only be granted on a question that is not
    a question of fact alone.&nbsp; Matters considered in granting leave include:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>whether the Divisional Court exercised appellate jurisdiction (in which case the applicant for leave is
    seeking a second appeal) or whether the Divisional Court was sitting as a court
    of original jurisdiction; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>whether the appeal involves
    the interpretation of a statute or regulation, including its constitutionality; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>the interpretation,
    clarification or propounding of some general rule or principle of law; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>whether the interpretation
    of the law or agreement in issue is of significance only to the parties or
    whether a question of general interest to the public or a broad segment of the
    public would be settled for the future:&nbsp; <i>Re United Glass and Ceramic
    Workers of North America</i>,<i> </i>[1973]
    2 O.R. 763<i> </i>(C.A.); <i>Re&nbsp;Sault Dock Co. Ltd. and City of Sault Ste.
    Marie</i>, [1973] 2 O.R. 479 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Iness v.</i> <i>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. </i>(2002), 62
    O.R. (3d) 255 (C.A.) at para. 8, Weiler J.A. confirmed that this court may
    grant leave to file affidavit evidence on a motion for leave to appeal in
    appropriate circumstances.  At para. 11, she went on to make the following clear:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Any affidavit submitted on the issue of public
    importance should limit itself to factual information. Otherwise, expert legal
    opinion to the effect that the issue between the parties raises questions of
    public importance is inappropriate as this is the very issue for the court to
    decide on the leave application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In other words, an affidavit submitted on a motion for leave to
    appeal must only be directed toward facts that speak to the public importance
    of the issues raised.  It must not contain opinion that the proposed appeal
    raises issues of public importance, since that is the very question to be
    answered on the motion for leave. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Counsel for 152 argues that
    although Weiler J.A. correctly considered r. 61.03(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 - which describes the contents of the
    motion record for leave to appeal – she did not consider the precise language
    used.  Specifically, he points to the language in r. 61.03(2)(vii): “a copy of <i>any
    other material in the court file</i> that is necessary for the hearing of the
    motion” (emphasis added).  He says that the rule therefore requires that any
    material filed on a leave motion must already exist within the court file.  I
    disagree.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Weiler J.A. essentially relied on
    two reasons for her conclusion in <i>Iness</i>.  First, she noted in para. 7
    that r. 61.03(2) “does not state that the motion record cannot contain any
    other materials”. Second, as she observed in para. 9: </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>Rules of the</i> <i>Supreme Court of Canada</i>,
    S.O.R./2002-156, s. 25(1)(b) expressly permit the filing of “any affidavits in
    support of the application for leave to appeal.”&nbsp; No separate leave is
    required to file such an affidavit, though the responding party may make a
    motion to strike the affidavit out if it is not relevant or contains improper
    submissions:&nbsp; <i>Ballard Estate v. Ballard Estate</i>, [1991] S.C.C.A. No. 239.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Weiler J.A. concluded that “[i]n the absence of any rule
    expressly permitting the filing of an affidavit concerning the issue of the
    public importance of an appeal … the matter is discretionary and leave must be
    obtained”.  In my view, none of the submissions advanced by 152 compel me to
    conclude that <i>Iness</i> is wrongly decided. To the contrary, I agree with her
    reasoning and her conclusions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, and importantly, at para.
    15 of <i>Iness</i> Weiler J.A. described the procedure to be followed where a
    party seeks to adduce evidence of public importance on a motion for leave to
    appeal to this court.  Given the way in which this matter proceeded before me,
    I believe it is worth repeating:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he party seeking to adduce evidence on the matter
    of public importance should file a motion to admit evidence on the matter and a
    supporting affidavit with the application for leave to appeal.&nbsp; Similarly,
    any response to the affidavit should be filed with the responding materials on
    the leave motion.&nbsp; The panel hearing the application for leave to appeal
    would then consider the motion to admit the evidence on the issue of public importance
    when considering the leave application.&nbsp; Motions to strike affidavits and
    motions to cross-examine on such affidavit material would properly be made to
    the chambers judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The MTO has not followed the procedure set out in <i>Iness</i>, in spite
    of Weiler J.A.’s instructions that in the future all parties should do so. 
    That is, it did not seek leave to admit the affidavit evidence of P. Lecoarer
    on the issue of public importance.  In addition, in the hearing before me, 152 largely
    limited its submissions to a challenge of the correctness of <i>Iness</i>.  Accordingly,
    although there was some argument on the content of the affidavit, I cannot say
    that it amounted to a full and complete argument to strike; fairness in these
    circumstances dictates that the procedure set out in <i>Iness</i> be complied
    with.  </p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In sum, <i>Iness</i> reflects the current law in Ontario where a
    party wishes to adduce affidavit evidence of public importance on a motion for
    leave to appeal to this court.  Accordingly, the MTO is required to file a
    motion to admit evidence on the matter and a supporting affidavit with its
    motion for leave to appeal.  In the meantime, leave is granted to the MTO to
    extend the time to file its factum and motion record to January 29, 2010.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>If 152 wishes to respond to the
    motion to admit the evidence of public importance, it should do so on the leave
    to appeal motion.  The panel hearing the leave motion will consider the motion
    to admit the evidence on the issue of public importance at the same time.  In
    the interim, motions may be made to a chambers judge to strike or cross-examine
    the affidavit evidence of public importance.   </span></p>
