  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants by cross-appeal (the “appellants”) seek
    to set aside the order of Linhares de Sousa J. that the respondent by cross-appeal
    Merali is not a “franchisor’s associate” within the meaning of s. 1(1) of the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> (<i>Franchise Disclosure</i>) <i>2000</i>,
    S.O. 2000, c. 3 (the “Act”).  They seek a
    declaration that Merali is a franchisor’s associate and a declaration that he
    is jointly and severally liable with the other respondents by cross appeal for
    the payments found owing by them pursuant to s. 6(6) of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appeal must be allowed.  The appellants are entitled to both
    declarations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge issued her reasons on November
    27, 2008.  She clearly and unequivocally
    found that both the franchisor (the respondent by cross-appeal Dollar It Limited)
    and the landlord (the respondent by cross-appeal Shikar Properties Inc.) are
    controlled by Merali.  There was ample,
    indeed overwhelming, evidence before her to support this factual finding.  There was no evidence otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the application judge did not include in her
    reasons an express conclusion that Merali is a franchisor’s associate, although
    the appellants had sought such a declaration in their application.  Following the issuance of those reasons, the
    appellants renewed their request for this declaration when attending before the
    application judge to settle the order.  The application judge did not grant the request.  Rather, the order as issued declared that the
    respondent Merali was not a franchisor’s associate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it is clear that the finding that Merali
    controls the franchisor renders him a franchisor’s associate for the purpose of
    the Act: see the definition of “franchisor’s associate” in s. 1(1) of the Act
    and <i>1490664 Ontario Ltd. v. Dig This
    Garden Retailers Ltd. </i>(2005), 256 D.L.R. (4th) 451 (Ont. C.A.).  The declaration to the contrary is therefore
    in error and must be set aside.  The
    declaration that Merali is a franchisor’s associate should issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although in settling the order the application judge
    declined to alter her November 27 reasons, the same paragraph of the order that
    declares that Merali is not a franchisor’s associate goes on to state that the
    respondent was merely acting as a representative of the franchisor and the
    landlord.  We would be reluctant to find
    that the application judge intended this as a finding of fact, since orders are
    not a forum for fact finding.  However,
    if it is to be considered a finding of fact, it is one that is clearly
    unreasonable on this record and cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since Merali is indeed a franchisor’s associate, he,
    along with the other two respondents by cross-appeal, is bound by s. 6(6) of
    the Act to make the payments to the appellants called for by that
    subsection.  As <i>Dig This Garden Retailers Ltd.</i> makes clear, failure to make those
    payments constitutes damages that can be claimed pursuant to ss. 4(5), 7 and 8
    of the Act from those who owe them, on a joint and several basis.  While the appellants’ application does not
    explicitly recite these sections, the record clearly demonstrates that the
    payments required by s. 6(6) have not been made, and that a declaration that
    the respondents by cross-appeal are jointly and severally liable to make them
    is sought.  Such a declaration should
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed.  Costs to the appellants are fixed in the total amount of $4000,
    inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
