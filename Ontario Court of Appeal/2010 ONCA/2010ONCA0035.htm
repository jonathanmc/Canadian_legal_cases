    has been detained at the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (“MHCP”) since
    1995.  Ms. Taylor, who is anatomically
    male, has been living as a female and takes prescription medication to make her
    body more feminine.  She is seeking

    review was whether or not the Board should make a disposition facilitating her
    desired transformation.  The Board
    adjourned the matter for the purpose of ensuring that relevant evidence,
    necessary to make such a disposition, became available.  The Board ordered that a psychiatric
    assessment be completed by Dr. Paul Federoff of the Royal Ottawa Mental Health
    Centre, to ascertain whether or not Ms. Taylor has a gender identity
    disorder.  The Board considered the
    assessment necessary to make the least restrictive and least onerous
    disposition, in accordance with its mandate under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, noting that a treatment impasse had developed between
    the accused and her health care providers.    </span></p>

line-height:200%;'>The assessment order required the
    MHCP to organize the assessment, and the Attorney General to fund its
    reasonable costs.  The Attorney General
    objected to its requirement to pay and applied to the Superior Court of Justice
    for an order in the nature of <i>certiorari </i>quashing
    the order, naming the Board as a party to the application.  The application judge ruled at the outset
    that the Board could only be named as an intervener in the proceedings and not as
    a party.  He went on to find that the
    Board lacked the jurisdiction to order the Attorney General to pay and quashed
    the order as requested.  The Board now appeals
    to this Court.</span></p>

    decide three of the issues on this appeal, namely, whether the application
    judge erred in removing the Board as a party and changing it to the status of intervener,
    and incidental to this issue, the standing of the Board to bring this appeal.
    The third issue is whether, since the order appealed from is a “costs order”,
    leave to appeal is required.  None of
    these issues raise a live concern, as there is no opposition to this Court hearing
    the appeal.  All parties agree that it is
    a matter of public importance for this Court to determine the fundamental issue
    at the centre of this case.  Accordingly,

line-height:200%;'>The Board takes the position that it
    has the authority to make the Attorney General pay for such assessments.   In its
    submissions, the Board relies heavily on its quasi-judicial role within the
    criminal justice system, and the resulting need for the Board to maintain its
    independence and impartiality.  The Board
    argues that its operational independence takes on a constitutional dimension
    given the liberty interests at stake.  Therefore, any realistic possibility or perception that the Board will
    fail to discharge its mandate under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, due to budgetary constraints, is unacceptable.  The Board submits that in rejecting these
    arguments the application judge committed reversible errors.  </span></p>

line-height:200%;'>Ms. Taylor, a respondent on this
    appeal, is also of the position that the Board should not pay for the
    independent psychiatric assessments it orders.  Ms. Taylor emphasizes the critical role that these assessments play in the
    Board’s ability to maintain public safety, and ensure the fair treatment of the
    accused, when determining the appropriate disposition in the
    circumstances.  She argues that it is imperative
    for these assessments to be properly funded either by the Attorney General or
    the MHCP.  </span></p>

line-height:200%;'>The Council supports the view put
    forward by Ms. Taylor and the Board.  More
    so, the Council emphasizes the need for independent assessments to provide the
    Board sufficient information upon which to make the least restrictive and least
    onerous disposition regarding the accused.  The Council raises the issue of the particular needs of long-term detainees,
    such as Ms. Taylor, for whom independent assessments are essential given the
    likelihood of a treatment impasse resulting from such long-term detention.</span></p>

line-height:200%;'>The Attorney General and the MHCP share the position that the absence of express statutory language in the <em>Criminal Code</em> is determinative of the Board&rsquo;s lack of authority to order the Attorney General to pay.  And, according to the Attorney General, it is clear that the use by the Board of its own budget for this purpose would not compromise its ability to make independent, impartial decisions.  This submission is bolstered by the representations of the MHCP that the Board has been offered funding by the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (&ldquo;MOHLTC&rdquo;) to ensure expenses associated with independent psychiatric assessments are covered.  The Attorney General and the MHCP submit that the application judge was correct in his reasons and result, and that the appeal ought to be dismissed. </span></p>

    making the assessment order at issue, the Board assumed jurisdiction that it
    did not have, either expressly or impliedly.  In arriving at this result he found that costs
    are a substantive matter, that there is no provision under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> authorizing the Board to
    order any party to pay the costs of an assessment, and that the case did not
    involve any values under the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  </span></p>

    “creature of statute”, which is not authorized to require a party to pay costs
    without express statutory authority, the application judge concluded that the
    Board had the power to hire and pay its own experts. The issue, therefore,
    distilled further to whether the cost associated with independent assessments
    should be paid by the Board through its budget allocated by the MOHLTC or
    directly by the MOHLTC.  The application
    judge captured the point succinctly, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 29,
    when he stated “[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]n effect, the ORB is asking this
    court to adjudicate on its own budgetary interests…” as opposed to the rights of
    any party or person subject to the Board’s jurisdiction. </span></p>

    had refused, or was likely to refuse, the funding of assessments required by
    the Board to ensure that it was able to meet its statutory mandate under Part
    XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. As such, the

line-height:200%;'>I cannot, indeed must not, leave this
    issue without commenting on the argument of the Board that if required to pay
    for independent assessments through its own budget, there will be at minimum “a
    perception” that overall financial concerns may impact on a decision of the
    Board to order an assessment in a particular case, thus eroding its independence
    and impartiality. </span></p>

line-height:200%;'>I make two observations in respect of
    this submission.  First, even if legitimate,
    a merely speculative perception does not provide a valid basis for conferring
    jurisdiction on the Board which it does not otherwise have under its enabling statute.
     Second, if the Board was to decide an
    individual case and, in doing so, entertained fiscal considerations as they
    pertain to the Board, it seems to me that an appeal would lie from such a
    decision.  Financial considerations,
    either in a general sense or more specifically, for example, whether the Board
    had exceeded its forecasted budget for assessments in a given year, are not
    legitimate considerations for the Board to take into account when deciding upon
    the necessity for an independent psychiatric assessment.  </span></p>

line-height:200%;'>In this regard, the application judge
    found that funding is available to ensure that the Board is able to meet the
    obligation of costs incurred as a result of the ordered assessments.  He found that the MOHLTC is prepared to fund all
    Board-ordered assessments, and that such funding will be provided by the MOHLTC
    through the budgetary process it establishes in consultation with the Board.  I repeat, there is no suggestion that any
    Board-ordered independent assessment would not be paid. </span></p>

line-height:200%;'>Presently, the Board has no budget
    line relating to independent assessments. We would urge the Board to submit a
    supplementary budget to MOHLTC dealing with this item for the current fiscal
    year, as soon as is practicable.</span></p>

line-height:200%;'>In conclusion, the critical nature of
    independent assessments cannot go unacknowledged.  It is imperative that there be no impediment
    to the proper exercise of the Board’s inquisitorial powers.  The ability of the Board to address insufficiencies
    in the evidence, prior to making the least restrictive and least onerous
    disposition necessary, must not be interfered with by budgetary constraints.  In order for the Board to be truly impartial
    and independent, it must decide these very important questions which involve the
    liberty of the subject, with the appropriate evidence before it, on the merits
    of each particular case and free of fiscal considerations.</span></p>
