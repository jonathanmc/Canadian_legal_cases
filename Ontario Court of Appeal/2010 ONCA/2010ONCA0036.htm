  <h2>I.         Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 16, 2005, the respondent Donald Darch
    was charged with arson, assault with a weapon and possession of a dangerous
    weapon.  The charges arose from an
    incident in which Mr. Darch threatened his brother with a large knife and
    attempted to set fire to his family home.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following his arrest, Mr. Darch was admitted to
    the Forensic Assessment Unit at the Whitby Mental Health Centre (now known as
    the Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Services) (the “Hospital”) for a
    mental health assessment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While at the Hospital, Mr. Darch was assessed by
    Dr. Z. Waisman.  In a report dated
    February 4, 2005, Dr. Waisman recorded that Mr. Darch had “a longstanding
    history of psychiatric difficulties in the form of psychotic disorder that was
    untreated and undetected”.  Further, his psychotic
    symptoms were “exacerbated by substance abuse” and “this case was complicated
    with the existence of possible cognitive deficits from a head injury.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In Dr. Waisman’s opinion, based on his clinical
    presentation, Mr. Darch appeared to have a major mental illness.  A differential diagnosis for Mr. Darch’s
    psychotic symptoms included “Substance-Induced Psychosis, Schizophrenia, and
    Delusional Disorder with Persecutory Features.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On March 22, 2005, H. J. Campbell J. of the
    Ontario Court of Justice found Mr. Darch not criminally responsible in respect
    of the index offences, described above, and ordered him detained at the Hospital
    to await a disposition by the Ontario Review Board (the “Board”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Darch remained an inpatient at the Hospital until
    January 2007, when he was transferred to Fairpark Manor, a group home.  The Board’s dispositions in 2007 and 2008
    regarding Mr. Darch required that he continue to be detained in the minimum
    secure unit of the Hospital, with privileges up to and including community
    living.  As a result, Mr. Darch continued
    to reside at Fairpark Manor throughout 2007 and 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In April 2009, the Board conducted a further
    annual review hearing concerning Mr. Darch.  The Board unanimously concluded that Mr. Darch “no longer represents a
    significant risk to the safety of the public and thus under s. 672.54 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> he should be absolutely
    discharged”.  Accordingly, by disposition
    dated May 4, 2009, the Board ordered that Mr. Darch be discharged
    absolutely.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hospital appeals from the Board’s
    disposition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Darch chose not to respond to or otherwise
    participate in this appeal.  However, <i>amicus curiae</i> counsel participated in the
    appeal, arguing against any inter-ference by this court with the Board’s
    decision.</p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hospital, supported by the Crown, challenges
    the Board’s disposition on two grounds.  First, it argues that the disposition was unreasonable as the Board failed
    to place sufficient weight on the uncontradicted expert evidence regarding the
    risk to public safety posed by Mr. Darch.  That risk, the Hospital says, requires that Mr. Darch continue to be
    subject to the structure and supervision afforded by a detention order, in
    order to ensure that he continues to take his required medications and
    participates in treatment for his condition.  Second, the Hospital seeks leave to introduce fresh evidence on appeal that
    it says undermines findings that were central to the Board’s disposition and that
    would reasonably have affected the result at the Board hearing, thus compelling
    a rehearing before the Board.</p>
  <h2>III.      Discussion</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Reasonableness
    of the Board’s Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not accept the assertion that the Board’s
    2009 disposition was unreasonable.  In my
    view, based on the evidential record then before it, the Board’s disposition was
    eminently reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In arriving at the conclusion that Mr. Darch no
    longer represented a significant risk to the safety of the public, the Board
    indicated that it relied on several factors:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>a)         Mr. Darch was unmedicated prior [to] the
    index offence[s] and lived relatively peaceably in the community for many
    years.  He has only one prior criminal
    conviction in 51 years of his life.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>b)        There
    were a combination of stressors that likely contributed to the actions at the
    time of the index offence[s], including the death of his father, learning his
    mother had a terminal illness and being required to move from the only home he
    had ever known.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>c)         He
    has been medication compliant since the time of [the] index offence[s].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>d)        He
    has not demonstrated any aggressive behaviour or violence since [the] index
    offence[s].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>e)         He
    is a rule bound and cooperative individual.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>f)         He
    states he wishes to remain at Fairpark Manor where he feels taken care of and
    has an environment similar to that he had with his parents.  He leads a quiet existence at Fairpark Manor.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>g)         He
    has the negative symptom of low motivation which makes it unlikely he will have
    the necessary resources to move from his present location.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>h)        He
    has not returned to drug use since the index offence[s] and has produced
    repeated negative urine screens.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>i)         He
    has been free of positive symptoms of his illness for a significant period [of]
    time since the index offence[s].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>j)         Although
    he does not specifically admit his mental illness he does admit to benefit from
    the medications.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no suggestion that the Board erred in
    its appreciation of the evidence concerning, or its description of, these
    factors.  On the contrary, each of the
    above-noted considerations identified by the Board was grounded in the
    evidential record.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence before the Board established that
    the members of Mr. Darch’s treatment team were not unanimous as to an
    appropriate disposition for him.  In an
    April 2009 report by the treatment team filed with the Board (the “Hospital
    Report”), the treatment team recommended that Mr. Darch be absolutely
    discharged from the Hospital.  The team reasoned,
    in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The actuarial and related clinical <span
class=GramE>assessment suggest</span> ongoing active areas of concern.  It does appear that Mr. Darch can stay at his
    present residence indefinitely.  It is
    noted that this setting replicates his earlier home environment, which worked
    until his parents weren’t available.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The increased acknowledgement of the situation at
    the time of the index offence[s] and his present assessment of his situation (a
    satisfactory setting for him) indicate he has made peace with the past and has
    settled into his lifestyle for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. R.W. Hill, Mr. Darch’s treating psychiatrist
    at the Hospital, signed the Hospital Report.  He was the only medical witness who testified at the Board hearing.  Notwithstanding his endorsement of the
    Hospital Report and, thus, of the recom-mendation contained in it that Mr.
    Darch should be absolutely discharged, Dr. Hill testified before the Board that
    Mr. Darch should be conditionally, rather than absolutely, discharged from the
    Hospital.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On my reading of his testimony, Dr. Hill’s recommendation
    of a conditional discharge was premised on his view that Mr. Darch could “act
    in worrisome and potentially violent ways” if he stopped taking his medication,
    resumed his use of cannabis and lost the community supports that he enjoyed at
    the time of the Board hearing.  Thus, Dr.
    Hill’s opinion that Mr. Darch posed a significant threat to the safety of the
    public was conditional on the happening of a series of events, none of which
    had occurred or was anticipated to occur at the time of the Board hearing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Hill himself confirmed in his evidence that:
    Mr. Darch had been compliant with his medication since moving into the
    community in January of 2007; since that time, there had been no decompensation
    in Mr. Darch’s mental state of which the Hospital was aware; “things [were]
    going well in the community” for Mr. Darch; Mr. Darch had presented “no troubles
    whatsoever” at the group home where he resided; Mr. Darch had not, at any time,
    indicated that he wished or intended to stop taking his medication; Mr. Darch
    had continued to be free of any positive symptoms of mental illness during the
    year prior to the Board’s 2009 hearing; and Mr. Darch had “increasingly said”
    that he wished to stay at the group home and he had “no reason to go anywhere
    else”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was also undisputed evidence before the
    Board that while living at the group home, Mr. Darch met regularly with Dr.
    Hill at the Hospital and with Dr. Adam Waese – Mr. Darch’s attending outpatient
    psychiatrist – and a mental health nurse from the Hospital.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I note, as well, that Mr. Darch was assessed for
    psychological risk in 2006 and again in 2009.  On both occasions, he was found to be a moderate risk for violent
    recidivism.  The 2009 Hospital Report
    stressed, however, that his “level of risk would be greater if he did not have
    the significant supports and supervision provided by the group home and [the
    Hospital’s] Forensic Outpatient Services”.  This support, it was suggested, limited Mr. Darch’s “exposure to
    excessive stress” and “ensures compliance with his psychopharmacological regimen
    to keep his psychotic symptoms under control”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the Board’s reasons in support of its
    disposition indicate that the Board was alive to concerns expressed by some
    members of Mr. Darch’s medical team regarding the possible public safety risk
    that he posed.  However, based on the
    totality of the evidence before it, the Board ruled that it was “unable to say
    with any certainty that Mr. Darch is a risk to the public”.  In my opinion, given the evidence adduced at
    the 2009 Board hearing, this holding was reasonable.  At its highest, the evidence before the Board
    suggested that Mr. Darch potentially could act violently if he stopped taking
    his medication, ceased living at his group home, lost his community supports
    and resumed the use of cannabis.  None of
    these speculative factors applied at the time of the Board hearing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent a demonstration that Mr. Darch posed a
    risk to public safety, his continued detention could not be justified.  It was reasonable for the Board to conclude
    on the record before it that the evidence adduced at the hearing fell short of
    meeting that key threshold for a continued detention order.  It follows that the Board’s decision to
    absolutely discharge Mr. Darch cannot be said to be unreasonable.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The
    Fresh Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hospital also seeks to introduce fresh
    evidence on this appeal, which it says undercuts certain pivotal findings by
    the Board that led to the disposition at issue.  The Hospital submits that if the fresh evidence had been available at
    the time of the Board hearing, the result of the hearing could reasonably have
    been affected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fresh evidence consists of two affidavits
    affirmed on September 30, 2009 and December 14, 2009 by Mr. Darch’s
    community-based psychiatrist, Dr. Adam Waese, together with excerpts from Mr.
    Darch’s Hospital clinical records.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R. v.
    Owen</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at paras. 59 and 71, Binnie J. of the Supreme
    Court cautioned: “An absolute discharge [of an NCR accused] should be granted
    only upon consideration of all the reliable evidence available both at the time
    of the Board hearing and, if appealed, at the time of the appellate review” and
    “[I]t will generally be desirable for an appellate court to admit fresh
    evidence that is trustworthy and touches on the issue of risk to public safety
    as being ‘necessary…in the interests of justice’.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am satisfied, as acknowledged by <i>amicus</i> counsel, that the Hospital has
    met the requisite test for the admission of fresh evidence on an appeal from a
    disposition of the Board as discussed in <i>Owen</i> at paras. 48-72<span class=GramE>.  I</span> would emphasize, in particular, that the admission of the fresh evidence in
    this case is necessary in the interests of justice given that both justice for
    Mr. Darch – whose liberty is at stake – and the protection of the public are
    the central issues on this appeal.  The
    fresh evidence is credible and bears directly on the key question of the risk
    to public safety posed by Mr. Darch.  It
    is also my view that the fresh evidence, if believed and if taken with the
    other evidence adduced before the Board (including the evidence of Dr. Hill and
    the evidence contained in the Hospital Report), could reasonably be expected to
    have affected the Board’s disposition.  I
    would, therefore, admit the fresh evidence on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The salient parts of the uncontradicted fresh
    evidence indicate that after Mr. Darch was absolutely discharged from the Hospital
    in May 2009: (i) he stopped taking his medication, almost immediately; (ii) he
    thereafter refused to meet with some members of his clinical outpatient team,
    including Dr. Waese; (iii) a resident at the group home where Mr. Darch resides
    reported that he sold him marijuana; (iv) Mr. Darch acknowledged that although
    he had not been caught by drug screening tests due to “good luck”, he had
    resumed intermittent use of marijuana even before his absolute discharge; (v)
    after he stopped using his medication, Mr. Darch was observed to be more
    agitated, argumentative and prone to swearing than he had been in the past; and
    (vi) Mr. Darch informed his social worker that, on his receipt of an expected
    share of family inheritance moneys, he was “considering moving out of Fairpark
    Manor to live on his own”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result of Mr. Darch’s post-discharge condition
    and the other post-discharge events outlined above, he was readmitted to the
    Hospital by Dr. Waese on July 24, 2009.  The Hospital appealed the Board’s disposition in late July 2009.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Darch was discharged
    from the Hospital to the community and returned to Fairpark Manor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to Dr. Waese’s sworn fresh evidence, after
    Mr. Darch’s return to the group home and after the Hospital initiated an appeal
    from the Board’s disposition, Mr. Darch restarted his medication, became
    compliant with treatment and exhibited a positive change in his level of
    interaction and co-operativeness with others.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his supplementary affidavit affirmed on
    December 14, 2009, Dr. Waese stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am concerned that Mr. Darch’s current actions
    suggest that his intentions regarding medication and treatment may again alter
    substantially should he not be under the jurisdiction of the [Board].  I anticipate that if his absolute discharge
    is upheld, he will quickly stop medication, and contact with the treatment
    team.  A relapse of psychosis will
    follow.  In an untreated, psychotic state
    Mr. Darch poses a significant risk to the safety of the public, considering the
    gravity of the index offence and the risk it posed to members of his family
    residing in the family home at the time of the arson.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Board’s May 4, 2009 finding that Mr. Darch
    no longer represented a significant risk to the safety of the public rested on
    several factors.  These included, at
    least implicitly if not explicitly, the expectations that Mr. Darch would
    remain “medication compliant”, “rule bound” and “cooperative”, that he would
    continue to reside at Fairpark Manor, and that he would refrain from drug use
    if granted an absolute discharge, all as discussed in the Hospital Report and
    Dr. Hill’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But the fresh evidence demonstrates that within
    a short time after his absolute discharge, Mr. Darch acted in a manner contrary
    to several of the factors relied on by the Board to ground its decision (see
    paragraph 12 above) and in a way that led his outpatient psychiatrist to view
    him as posing a significant risk to the safety of the public.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fresh evidence tendered by the Hospital
    undermines several of the Board’s reasons for granting an absolute discharge
    and, in several material respects, the factual foundation for the Board’s
    disposition.  Further, in my view, the
    fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the result of the Board
    hearing.  I conclude, therefore, that the
    appeal must be allowed and a rehearing held by the Board.  </p>
  <h2>IV.      Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the disposition of the Board and remit the matter back to the Board
    for rehearing.  In the particular circum-stances
    of this case, I would also direct that, if possible, the rehearing be conducted
    by the same panel of the Board as that which conducted Mr. Darch’s April 2009
    annual review hearing.</p>
