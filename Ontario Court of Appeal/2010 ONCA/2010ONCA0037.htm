lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman";'>owned a 38.06 acre parcel of land in
    the Town of Ajax (the “original parcel”).  The original parcel was classified by the Municipal Property Assessment
    Corporation (“MPAC”) as a Commercial, Industrial or Multi-Residential Property.  Favorable tax treatment was attached to this
    classification.  </span></p>

    2000, the original parcel was severed into two parcels: one 9.79 acre parcel
    (the “child parcel”) and one 28.29 acre parcel (the “mother parcel”).  The appellants retained the mother parcel and
    conveyed the child parcel to Home Depot.   At the time, the Act did not impose tax consequences on severance or
    subdivision. </span></p>

    on certain “eligible” properties including, pursuant to s. 447.70(21<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c), property “that was subdivided or was subject to a
    severance”.  The appellants applied to
    Superior Court for a declaration that the amendments did not apply to
    severances that occurred in 2000, such that the mother parcel would continue to
    enjoy favorable tax treatment.  On
    November 6, 2007, Pattillo J. dismissed the application.   His decision was upheld by the Divisional
    Court on October 24, 2008.</span></p>

    appellants take </span><span style='line-height:200%;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>the position that the mother parcel is
    not an “eligible property” under the amendments for municipal tax purposes because
    the severance took place in 2000, well before s. 447.70(21)(c) came into force.  In other words, they argue that the

    three submissions in support of their position.  First, they argue that the scheme of the Act supports an immediate,
    rather than retrospective, application.  Second, they argue that the absence of regulations dealing with properties
    severed before January 1, 2001, when considered in light of the regulations
    that address properties severed after that date, demonstrates that the
    legislature did not intend the amendments to apply retrospectively.  Third, they submit that they had vested
    rights and were thus entitled to a presumption that s. 447.70(21<span

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Today there
    is only one principle or <span class=GramE>approach,</span> namely, the words
    of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and

    and the intention of Parliament.<a

    determine the meaning that &quot;would be understood by a competent language
    user upon reading the word in their immediate context.&quot; The immediate
    context consists of as much of the text surrounding the words to be interpreted
    as is needed to make sense of those words and usually consists of the section
    in which the words appear: see R. Sullivan, <i>Statutory
    Interpretation</i>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2007) at 50-51.  Although the use of the past tense in s.
    447.70(21<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) is consistent with a retrospective
    application, in this case, a textual analysis is not necessarily conclusive.  I accordingly turn to the appellant’s three
    submissions, which speak to the legislative scheme and intention of the
    legislature. </p>
  <h2>Legislative scheme and intention of the legislature</h2>

    argument is that the scheme of the Act supports the conclusion that s. 447.70(21<span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    properties to which Part XXII.3 of the Act<i> </i>applies.  The </span></span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman";'>historical background behind the amendments
    is instructive in identifying </span><span class=Prompt><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>those properties and, in my view, suggests
    that s. 447.70(21<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) captures the mother parcel owned
    by the appellants.  Four dimensions of
    the legislative scheme support this conclusion.</span></span></p>

    to 1998, the municipal property assessment and taxation system was “grossly out
    of date and, as a result, extremely unfair.  Many taxpayers in similar situations were paying very different property

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  To rectify this situation, in 1998 the
    government implemented a Current Value Assessment (“CVA”) taxation system.  Taxes were calculated by multiplying the CVA
    by the applicable tax rate for the property class.  </span></p>

    sudden move to CVA resulted in disproportionate changes in taxes for certain
    properties, including the commercial, industrial and multi-residential
    classes.  Accordingly, the government
    introduced a system of taxation caps and clawbacks for those properties, which
    were referred to as “protected classes”.  Their level of taxation was effectively frozen at the December 31, 1997
    rate, subject to legislated increases.  The purpose of the cap/clawback system was to ensure a more manageable
    transition to a CVA taxation scheme.<a

    one that operates for the future only.&nbsp; It is prospective, but it imposes
    new results in respect of a past event.&nbsp; A retroactive statute <i>operates
    backwards</i>.&nbsp; A retrospective statute <i>operates forwards</i>, but it
    looks backwards in that it attaches new consequences <i>for the future </i>to
    an event that took place before the statute was enacted.&nbsp; A retroactive

    the original parcel, and the “legal effects” are the tax consequences.   <span

    different tax consequences for 2001 onwards for a 2000 severance - future consequences

    sudden transition to a CVA scheme would likewise create unfairness.  Tax unfairness is clearly a public harm with
