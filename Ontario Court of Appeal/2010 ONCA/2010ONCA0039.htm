  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pled guilty to various credit card offences and unlawfully
    being in Canada. The trial judge rejected a joint submission for a global
    sentence of 7 months imprisonment on the basis that it was manifestly
    inadequate and consequently would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute. The trial judge then proceeded to impose a sentence that effectively
    amounted to eighteen months. His reasons for doing so provide little insight as
    to why he increased the proposed sentence by such a significant amount. Given
    this error, we are not bound to show the deference that we would otherwise
    accord to the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we are of the view that the proposed global
    sentence of seven months was inadequate. The offences involved identity fraud,
    a serious crime. The appellant had a prior conviction for conspiracy to commit
    fraud, for which he received a two year sentence and was deported. At the time
    of the predicate offences, he was illegally in Canada and had been here for
    some time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against these factors, we note that the criminal record is dated and the
    appellant pled guilty, thereby saving court time and abandoning any possible
    defence he may have had. Fresh evidence has also been filed which provides some
    additional information of a positive nature in support of mitigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, we would not disturb the five month sentence imposed for the
    Immigration Act charge (save for an adjustment for pre-trial custody). On the
    remaining offences, for which the trial judge imposed consecutive sentences of
    two months each, consecutive to the five months imposed on the immigration
    offence, we are of the view that a global sentence of seven months concurrent
    is appropriate, but consecutive to the five month imposed for the Immigration
    Act offence. We would reduce the global sentence of 12 months by 3 months for
    pre-trial custody and arbitrarily assign the reduction to the Immigration Act
    offence, thereby reducing that sentence from five months to two months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is allowed and a global sentence of 9 months
    is imposed.</p>
