  <p class=headingNUMBER><b> I. Introduction </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal from a summary judgment granted
    by <span class=SpellE>Maranger</span> J. in an action claiming the amount owing
    on a mortgage and related guarantees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants did not file material in the court below
    to support a substantive defence to the action. Instead they claimed that the
    respondent was not entitled to obtain summary judgment because the action is
    subject to the mandatory mediation rule in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, and no mediation
    session had been held. The motion judge rejected this argument, holding that
    the mandatory mediation rule does not expressly prohibit a summary judgment
    motion prior to mandatory mediation and that mediation would be a needless step
    in this case. He therefore granted summary judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on appeal is whether a party may obtain
    summary judgment before a mediation session is held in an action governed by Rule
    24.1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;For the reasons that follow, I conclude that,
    provided the moving party brings a summary judgment motion within the timelines
    stipulated in the Rules for holding a mediation session, the moving party is
    entitled to obtain summary judgment. In all the <span class=GramE>circumstances</span> of this case, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of this case are straightforward. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent sued the appellants for payment on a
    mortgage and related guarantees in a statement of claim dated June 17, 2008. After
    serving a notice of intent to defend on August 5, 2008, the appellants
    delivered their statement of defence and counterclaim on August 14, 2008. The
    respondent delivered its reply and defence to counterclaim on November 18,
    2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 7, 2008, the mediation office at the Superior
    Court of Justice in Ottawa sent counsel for all parties a Notice of Requirement
    to Mediate setting out the following timelines: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the parties were required to attend a mediation
    session within 90 days after the first defence in the action was filed; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>the</span> respondent was
    required to file a notice with the mediation coordinator within 30 days of
    August 6, 2008, stating the mediator's name and the date of the mediation
    session. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;On September 2, 2008, counsel for the respondent
    wrote to the mediation office to <span class=GramE>advise</span> that the
    parties had consented to a 60-day extension of the time for selecting a
    mediator and fixing a mediation date.<span style='background:yellow;'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 30, 2008, counsel for the respondent
    forwarded a Notice of Name of Mediator and Date of Session to counsel for the
    appellants. The notice named the mediator but stated the date of the mediation
    session had yet to be fixed. Subsequently, on November 6, 2008, the parties
    obtained a consent order extending the time for completion of the mediation by 120
    days. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 5, 2009, counsel for the respondent served a
    notice of motion for summary judgment returnable March 26, 2009. The appellants
    did not respond to the motion until March 23, 2009. On that date, they served
    material challenging the respondent's right to obtain summary judgment prior to
    attending a mediation session. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an affidavit sworn by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Guibault</span> on behalf of all of the appellants, he acknowledged that under the [November
    6, 2008] Order ... the time for mediation would have been extended to
    approximately the present time. However, he also said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Defendants wish to have <span class=GramE>a
    mediation</span> in this proceeding as required by the Rules of Civil
    Procedure. The Defendants are willing to attend <span class=GramE>a mediation</span> at an early date and to participate therein in good faith in an effort to
    resolve the matters at issue in this proceeding by agreement between the
    Parties.<span style='background:yellow;'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 8, 2009, the motion judge granted the
    respondent's request for summary judgment. In his reasons, he observed that
    there were no <span class=SpellE>controverted</span> factual issues in this
    case and said that normally the relief requested ... would be granted
    axiomatically.<span style='background:yellow;'> </span>However,
    he also noted that the appellants had raised a technical issue submitting that
    the summary judgment motion should be either stayed or dismissed because [the respondent]
    failed to attend at and/or engage in mandatory mediation ... prior to
    initiating the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. Rule 24.1</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 24.1 is entitled Mandatory Mediation. Attached
    as Appendix A to these reasons is the full text of this Rule. Amendments to
    Rule 24.1 that came into force on January 1, 2010 are included in the appendix
    in grey shading. References to the rules within the body of these reasons are
    to the provisions as they stood at the relevant time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 24.1.01 provides for mandatory mediation in case
    managed actions in order to reduce cost and delay and to facilitate the
    early and fair resolution of disputes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 24.1.02 explains the mediation process:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24.1.02 <span class=GramE>In</span> mediation, a
    neutral third party facilitates communication among the parties to a dispute,
    to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution.<span
style='background:yellow;'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 24.1.04(1) stipulates that the mandatory mediation
    rule applies to actions commenced in the City of Ottawa on or after January 1,
    2001. However, rule 24.1.04(2.1) provides that the mandatory mediation rule
    does not apply to an action under the <i>Substitute
    Decisions Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 30, or Part V of the <i>Succession Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. S.26, nor, in certain circumstances, to an action that was the subject of a
    mediation under section 258.6 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 24.1.05 allows the court to make an order exempting
    an action from the mandatory mediation rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 24.1.09 is particularly important. It sets out the
    timelines for holding a mediation, permits the court to change the timelines and
    specifies the criteria the court must consider in determining whether to vary
    the timelines:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24.1.09 (1) <span class=GramE>A</span> mediation
    session shall take place within 90 days after the first defence has been filed,
    unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) In considering whether to exercise the power
    conferred by <span class=SpellE>subrule</span> (1), the court shall take into
    account all the circumstances, including,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> number of
    parties, the state of the pleadings and the complexity of the issues in the
    action;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) <span class=GramE>whether</span> a party
    intends to bring a motion under Rule 20 (Summary Judgment), Rule 21
    (Determination of an Issue Before Trial) or Rule 22 (Special Case);</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) <span class=GramE>whether</span> the
    mediation will be more likely to succeed if the 90-day period is extended to
    allow the parties to obtain evidence under,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) Rule 30
    (Discovery of Documents),</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii) Rule 31
    (Examination for Discovery),</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii) Rule 32
    (Inspection of Property),</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>(iv)
    Rule</span> 33 (Medical Examination), or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(v) Rule 35
    (Examination for Discovery by Written Questions); and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) <span class=GramE>whether</span>, given the
    nature of the case or the circumstances of the parties, the mediation will be
    more likely to succeed if the 90-day period is extended or abridged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) Despite <span class=SpellE>subrule</span> (1),
    in the case of an action on the standard track, the mediation session may be
    postponed for up to 60 days if the consent of the parties is filed with the
    mediation coordinator.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) The parties shall choose a mediator under <span
class=SpellE>subrule</span> 24.1.08&nbsp;(2).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) Within 30 days after the filing of the first defence,
    the plaintiff shall file with the mediation coordinator a notice (Form 24.1A)
    stating the mediator's name and the date of the mediation session.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

'><b>IV. The Motion Judge's Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In essence, the motion judge concluded that Rule 24.1
    does not prohibit a party from obtaining summary judgment prior to attending a
    mediation session and that, in the context of a case where it is clear there is
    no genuine issue for trial, it does not make sense to require the parties to go
    through the process of mediation. After reviewing Rule 20, Rule 24.1 and rule
    1.04(1), he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>... in a case where the result of a summary
    judgment motion is clear, such as the case at bar, then to conduct a mandatory
    mediation in advance of that motion is a needless step in a proceeding that uselessly
    increases costs. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It seems to me that although not expressly exempt
    in Rule 24.1, Rule 20 clearly provides what is necessary to allow for the
    advancing of a summary judgment motion and it is silent respecting mediation,
    and in this case every step required by that rule was undertaken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>V. Discussion&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on appeal raises a question of the proper
    interpretation of Rule 24.1. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can now be said that it is trite law that provisions
    of an act are to be interpreted in their entire context and in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the
    Act, and the intention of Parliament: <i>Bell <span class=SpellE>ExpressVu</span> Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2
    S.C.R. 559, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 26, citing Elmer <span
class=SpellE>Driedger</span>, <i>Construction
    of Statutes</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p. 83.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper approach to interpreting regulations is quite
    similar; <span class=SpellE>Driedgers</span> modern rule applies, requiring
    courts to look at the entire context and purpose of the provision, as well as
    its grammatical and ordinary meaning. In this case of regulations, this context
    includes the purpose and scheme of their enabling statute and other regulations
    made pursuant to it: <span class=SpellE><i>Glykis</i></span><i> v. Hydro-Québec</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 285,
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 5; <i>Bristol-Myers
    Squibb Co. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 533, at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 37-38, 97-99.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i> may be a somewhat unique regulation, as they are essentially
    the product of the Civil Rules <span class=GramE>Committee,</span> however they
    are a regulation nonetheless. Any consideration of an individual rule must
    involve a consideration of the object, purpose and structure of the <i>Rules</i> as a whole, as well as, where
    relevant, the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    R.S.O 1990, c. C.43. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering Rule 24.1 in light of these principles, in
    my opinion several factors point to the conclusion that a party may obtain
    summary judgment without attending a mediation session in an action governed by
    the mandatory mediation rule so long as the party complies with the rules
    prescribing timelines for holding a mediation session.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Rule 24.1 creates a scheme of mandatory
    mediation premised on a mediation session being held within a particular timeline:
    90 days from the date on which the first defence is filed. While Rule 24.1
    makes it mandatory to hold <span class=GramE>a mediation</span> within this
    specified timeline, it does not make it mandatory to hold a mediation in every
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its face, Rule 24.1 does not apply to undefended
    proceedings. Similarly, because Rule 20 permits a party to move for summary
    judgment before a defence is filed in limited circumstances, the mandatory mediation
    provision would not be triggered in a case where a plaintiff moved for and
    obtained summary judgment prior to a defence being filed.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Rule 24.1 does not, on its face, prohibit a
    party from moving for and obtaining summary judgment once the 90-day clock has
    started ticking. This is important because other jurisdictions have chosen to
    make it clear that, once pleadings have closed, the parties to a contested
    matter must attend a mediation session before taking any further steps in the proceeding:
    See the<i> Queens Bench Act, </i>R.S.S.
    1978, c. Q-1 (Sask.), s. 54.2(1).<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> Had the Rules Committee intended to prohibit motions for summary judgment while
    the 90-day clock is ticking, it could easily have said so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, not only does Rule 24.1 not prohibit a party from
    applying for and obtaining  a  summary  judgment  while  the
     90-day  clock  is
     ticking,  Rule  24.1.09(2) <span class=GramE>provides</span> that in deciding whether to exercise the power contained in Rule 24.1.09(1) to extend
    or abridge the time for holding a mediation, the court shall consider whether
    a party intends to bring a motion [for summary judgment].<span
style='background:yellow;'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain reading of Rule 24.1.09(2), it permits the
    court to extend the time for holding a mediation session so that a party may
    bring a motion for summary judgment. If the court can extend the time for
    attending a mediation session so that a summary judgment motion can be brought,
    it only makes sense that the moving party can also obtain summary judgment
    before attending a mediation session. It would make little sense to extend the
    time for attending a mediation session so that a summary judgment motion can be
    brought if the moving party could not obtain summary judgment before attending
    a mediation session. Rule 24.1 is aimed at trying to avoid unnecessary expense
    and delay, not at creating it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, as the motion judge observed, Rule 20 sets out
    the circumstances in which a summary judgment motion may be brought; it, like
    Rule 24.1, contains no prohibition against applying for and obtaining a summary
    judgment while the 90-day clock is ticking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, Rule 1.04 supports interpreting Rule 24.1 to
    permit a party to obtain a summary judgment prior to attending a mediation
    session. Rule 1.04 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.04 The Rules shall be liberally construed to
    secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every
    civil proceeding on its merits.<span style='background:yellow;'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the motion judge observed, in some instances it will
    be obvious that a mediation session will, in all likelihood, constitute no more
    than an extra step in the proceeding. In a case such as this, where the claim
    is on a mortgage and related written guarantees, and where no defence on the
    merits is advanced on the summary judgment motion, holding <span class=GramE>a
    mediation</span> is unlikely to secure the just, most expeditious and least
    expensive determination of the proceeding on its merits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I do not agree that the respondent was
    required to apply for an exemption from mediation before proceeding with its
    motion. For the reasons I have explained, in my view, a party is entitled to
    move for summary judgment before attending a mediation session provided the
    party complies with the timelines stipulated in the Rules for attending a
    mediation session. If the motion can be heard within the timelines, there is no
    need to obtain an exemption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I also observe that nothing in Rule 20 stops
    the 90-day clock from running once a summary judgment motion is launched.
    Practicalities are not a licence to ignore mandatory provisions in the Rules.
    If a summary judgment motion cannot be heard and determined within the 90-day
    timeline set out in Rule 24.1 (or any extended timeline the parties are
    entitled to consent to), it is incumbent on the parties to attend a mediation
    session or apply for an extension of the timeline under rule 24.1.09.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, the timeline for completing
    the mediation was first extended for 60 days on September 2, 2008, and then for
    a further 120 days by consent order on November 6, 2008; the timeline therefore
    expired on around March 6, 2009; and the summary judgment motion was not heard
    until March 26, 2008. In these circumstances, it was incumbent on the
    respondent to either attend a mediation session or apply for an extension of
    time for doing so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral submissions on the appeal, the respondents
    counsel explained that, when the summary judgment motion was served, March 26,
    2008 was the first available date. Moreover, it appears that the issue below
    was the respondents right to bring a summary judgment motion before attending
    a mediation session; no issue was raised about the fact that the time for
    completing the mediation had already expired. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given these circumstances, the fact that the action
    involved a claim on a mortgage and related guarantees, and the fact that the
    appellants filed no materials to support a substantive defence, I have no doubt
    that the motion judge would have granted an extension of the time for attending
    a mediation session had he been asked to do so. In these circumstances, I see
    no error in the motion judge's conclusion that the respondent was entitled to <span
class=GramE>proceed</span> with its summary judgment motion before attending a
    mediation session. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>VI. Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is
    dismissed. In all the circumstances, I would make no order as to costs. </p>
