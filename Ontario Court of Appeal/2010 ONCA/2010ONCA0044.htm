  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 4, 2004 at about 9:30 p.m., the appellant
    Derek <span class=SpellE>Crinson</span> left his work as the executive chef at
    Lula Lounge on <span class=SpellE>Dundas</span> Street in Toronto.  He had only walked a short distance when he slipped
    on the ice-covered sidewalk on the south side of <span class=SpellE>Dundas</span> Street and suffered a badly fractured ankle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was admitted to hospital that night, and was
    operated on two days later.  A permanent
    metal screw was inserted in his ankle.  He was discharged on February 8.  For the following two weeks, the appellant was given the drug Percocet to
    control his post-operative pain.  The
    expert evidence from Dr. <span class=SpellE>Dezso</span> Kadar, an eminent
    pharmacologist, was that Percocet contains an active ingredient that is approximately
    twice as potent as morphine and that it has serious negative psychological side
    effects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sued the respondent City of Toronto for damages.  There were two issues at trial: first,
    whether the appellant’s failure to give notice within ten days of his injury as
    required by the <i>Municipal Act,</i> <i>2001</i>,<i> </i>S.O. 2001, c. 25, (the “Act”) was saved by a “reasonable excuse” as provided
    for by s. 44(12) of the Act, and second, whether the respondent was grossly
    negligent within the meaning of s. 44(9) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge decided both questions against the
    appellant and dismissed his action.  For
    the reasons that follow, we conclude that he erred in both respects.  We would therefore allow the appeal and,
    since damages have been agreed upon, grant judgment in that amount to the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We will address each issue in turn.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        THE
    REASONABLE EXCUSE ISSUE<u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant suffered his injury on February 4,
    2004.  He gave notice of his claim to the
    respondent on June 30, 2004.  The
    respondent does not argue that the action subsequently brought by the appellant
    was commenced after the expiry of the applicable statutory limitation period.  What is at issue is whether the appellant
    complied with the obligation to give notice within ten days of the occurrence
    of his injury, an obligation sometimes referred to as a limitation period within
    a limitation period.  The relevant
    sections of the Act are s. 44(10) and s. 44(12).  They read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>44(10) No action shall be brought for the recovery
    of damages under subsection (2) unless, within 10 days after the occurrence of
    the injury, written notice of the claim and the injury complained of has been
    served upon or sent by registered mail to,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       <span
class=GramE>the</span> clerk of the municipality</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>44(12) Failure to give notice or insufficiency of
    the notice is not a bar to the action if a judge finds that there is reasonable
    excuse for the want or the insufficiency of the notice and that the
    municipality is not prejudiced in its defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge interpreted s. 44(12) to require the
    appellant to prove that he was so incapacitated in the ten days following his
    accident that he was unable to give notice to the City.  Otherwise his action was statute-barred.  The trial judge put the test this way at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 6 of his reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Pursuant to section 44(12) of the <i>Municipal Act</i> the plaintiff must prove
    that he was so incapacitated during the ten day notice period that he was
    unable to arrange for the notice to the City.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then applied this test to the evidence
    and concluded as follows at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 17 and 18: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Kadar’s opinion is, “Mr. <span class=SpellE>Crinson’s</span> state of mind was severely impaired during the two weeks he was taking the [P]<span
class=SpellE>ercocet</span>.”  Dr. Kadar
    did not specifically testify as to the plaintiff’s capacity to make decisions
    nor did he testify at what point in time the [P]<span class=SpellE>ercocet</span> would likely affect decision making.  He
    did say that after the plaintiff stopped taking the [P]<span class=SpellE>ercocet</span>,
    the effects on his brain would be eliminated in two to three days.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In line with <span class=SpellE><i>Kors</i></span><i> v. Toronto City</i> I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove that
    he was so incapacitated that he was unable to make arrangements to send the
    required notice to the City within ten days.  Therefore, the plaintiff’s action is statute barred.  He failed to provide a “reasonable excuse”
    under section 44(12) of the <i>Municipal
    Act.</i>  [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then went on to consider the effect of
    s. 44(12) on the assumption that his initial conclusion was in error, and that
    the appellant was in fact incapacitated for the first ten days after his
    accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He concluded that even if the notice period could be
    extended until the appellant was no longer affected by the Percocet he had been <span class=GramE>taking,</span> the June 30, 2004 notice was far too
    late.  He said this at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even if I was to accept that the plaintiff was
    incapacitated from the time he entered the hospital until he stopped taking the
    [P]<span class=SpellE>ercocet</span>, the ten day notice period would begin to
    run from February 25, 2004, calculated from discharge from the hospital on February
    8, 2004, p[l]us 14 days taking [P]<span class=SpellE>ercocet</span> plus 2 to 3
    days to eliminate the effects of the [P]<span class=SpellE>ercocet</span>.  The plaintiff’s notice of June 30, 2004 was
    far outside the extended notice period and therefore, the plaintiff’s action
    against the City is statute barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge based his reading of s. 44(12) of the
    Act on two cases: <span class=SpellE><i>Kors</i></span><i> v. Toronto (City) </i>(2006), 25 M.P.L.R.
    (4th) 70 (S.C.) and <span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span><i> v. Thunder Bay</i> <i>(City)</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).  In <span class=SpellE><i>Kors</i></span><i>,</i> the motion
    judge, in granting summary judgment dismissing a slip-and-fall claim, applied
    the test of incapacity insufficient to render the plaintiff unable to give
    notice, but did so without explanation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave much more attention to <span
class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span>, in two
    important ways.  First, he took it as
    appellate support for the incapacity test he applied, namely that s. 44(12)
    required that the appellant be so incapacitated during the notice period that
    he could not comply.  He quoted and
    applied the distinction made in <span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span> between incapacity and simply failing to address
    one’s mind to the steps that should be taken to protect one’s legal interests
    after an accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge concluded that if the appellant
    was sufficiently incapacitated in the first ten days after his accident, <span
class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span> extended
    the time limit for giving notice to ten days after the appellant ceased to be
    incapacitated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge erred in law in finding
    that s. 44(12) required the appellant to meet the incapacity test that the
    trial judge enunciated, and in taking support for this from <span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span> was also a case about a fall on an icy sidewalk.  It was decided in April 2000.  However, it involved s. 47 of the then-existing <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.
    15, as it then was, not s. 44(12) of the Act,.  At that time, the former <i>Municipal
    Act</i> required notice to be served within seven days of the accident and
    provided no exception whatsoever for an injury caused by ice on a
    sidewalk.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span> held that s. 47 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> applied to offer some limited relief from the unjust result flowing from the <i>Municipal Act</i> as it then was, in that it
    allowed an exception for a plaintiff who was of “unsound mind”, in the rather
    archaic words of that section.  The
    incapacity exception to the notice requirement applied in <span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span> came from the <i>Limitations Act, </i>not the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  In language echoed by the trial judge in this
    case, this court wrote this at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The standard set by s. 47 for establishing that a
    person is of “unsound mind” is a high one. A plaintiff must demonstrate incapacity.&nbsp;
    A debilitating condition short of incapacity cannot be relied on even though it
    makes compliance with a notice requirement or a limitation period more
    difficult.&nbsp; <u>Nor can s. 47 be approached by asking whether the
    plaintiff, given his or her condition, could reasonably have been expected to</u> <u>give notice within the required time</u>.&nbsp; While it might be eminently
    reasonable to conclude that an injured plaintiff was preoccupied with matters
    other than serving notice to the City within seven days of an accident, that
    preoccupation cannot be equated with incapacity for the purposes of s. 47 of
    the Limitations Act.  Finally, one must
    also distinguish between incapacity and a simple failure to address one’s mind
    to the steps, if any, which should be taken to protect one’s legal interests
    after an accident.&nbsp; Again, it is understandable that an injured person would
    be primarily concerned with his or her immediate well-being in the days
    following an accident and not with commencing legal action.&nbsp; Although
    understandable, a failure to advert to the need to take steps to preserve one’s
    rights does not constitute incapacity.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly however, the court concluded its reasons<i> </i>this way at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    72:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I must conclude
    that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bannon’s</span> action should be dismissed.&nbsp;
    This result is most unsatisfactory.&nbsp; <u>It would be unreasonable to expect
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bannon</span> to have acted any sooner than she did</u>.&nbsp;
    Nor is there any reason to believe that the City would have been in a better position
    to defend against the action had it received notice 10 days earlier than it
    did.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as the law now stands, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bannon</span> had the misfortune of falling on an icy sidewalk and the City is therefore able
    to avoid the consequence of its gross negligence by reliance on a notice requirement
    which can only be described as draconian.&nbsp; This court has called for
    legislative action to prevent injustices caused by notice provisions like that
    found in s. 284(5) of the Act: <span class=SpellE>eg</span>. <span class=GramE>see</span> <span class=SpellE>Filip</span> v. Waterloo, supra, at p. 540.&nbsp; At a bare
    minimum, a person who finds him or herself in the position of Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bannon</span> should have access to the limited exception to the
    notice requirement available in s. 284(6) to those whose injury is not caused
    by snow or ice on a sidewalk.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislative response in 2001 was to enact both s.
    44(10) of the Act to extend the period in which notice must be given to ten
    days, and s. 44(12) to provide relief from this if there is reasonable excuse
    and the municipality is not prejudiced in its defence.  In 2002, the Act was amended to make both
    provisions applicable to a claim based on a fall on an icy sidewalk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This evolution in the governing legislation makes clear
    that relief from the notice requirement is not now confined only to the narrow
    circumstance of a plaintiff who is so incapacitated as to be unable to give
    notice to the municipality as that concept was set out in s. 47 of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the case at bar, the interpretation of s.
    44(12) and the concept of “reasonable excuse” has received some judicial
    consideration in Ontario.  For example,
    in <span class=SpellE><i>Cena</i></span><i> v. Oakville (Town)</i> (2009), 56 M.P.L.R.
    (4th) 11 (Ont. S.C.), in a passage with which I agree, Murray J. wrote this at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the plaintiff should have the benefit
    of a broad and liberal interpretation of “reasonable excuse”.&nbsp; Failure to
    comply with the 10 day time limit mandated by subsection 44(10) is a bar to an
    action where the plaintiff establishes reasonable excuse for the want or the insufficiency
    of the notice <i>and</i> that the
    municipality is not prejudiced in its defence.&nbsp; Where the municipality is
    prejudiced in its defence, failure to comply with the time limit is a bar. In
    my view, the protection granted to the municipality where it is prejudiced in
    its defence is good reason why a liberal interpretation should be given to the
    words “reasonable excuse”.  <span
class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statutory test introduced in 2001 requires the
    court to determine if there is reasonable excuse for the failure or insufficiency
    of notice.  For over a century similar
    language has been used from time to time in legislation in order to relieve
    against the very strict notice requirements that must be met before one can sue
    a municipality.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern jurisprudence interpreting such language has
    emphasized, not surprisingly, that the words “reasonable excuse” should be
    given their plain and ordinary meaning and that the court should consider all
    the circumstances of the particular case in determining whether the plaintiff
    has indeed established reasonable excuse.  See for example <span class=SpellE><i>Lassen</i></span><i> v. Calgary (City)</i>, (1985), 60 A.R. 111
    (C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused (1985), 62 N.R.
    239n, at 114-15; and <i>Teller v. Sunshine
    Coast (Regional District)</i> (1990), 67 D.L.R. (4th) 62 (B.C.C.A.).  In both cases the court considered all of the
    circumstances, including whether or not the plaintiff knew of the need to give
    prompt notice, in coming to the conclusion that he had reasonable excuse for
    not giving notice on time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view therefore, the trial judge erred in law in
    interpreting s. 44(12) to require the appellant to show incapacity in order to
    establish reasonable excuse.  Rather, the
    question to be addressed is whether in all the circumstances of the case, it
    was reasonable for the appellant not to give notice until June 30, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent does not argue that the delay in
    receiving notice caused any prejudice to its defence.  No evidence was led to support such a
    claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in determining whether this action is barred by
    s. 44(10), the only issue is whether, on the facts of this case, the appellant
    has met the test of reasonable excuse in s. 44(12), properly interpreted.  In our view, this court is in a position to
    address that question in light of the record before it.  At trial, the appellant argued for the
    broader interpretation of s. 44(10) that we have accepted.  He called the evidence available to him on
    that issue, particularly the circumstances affecting him from the date of the accident
    through to the end of June.  The
    respondent essentially chose not to cross-examine on this evidence and called
    no evidence to contradict it.  However it
    was a live issue at trial.  Fairness does
    not therefore require a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made only one finding of fact relevant
    to this issue.  He accepted that the
    appellant did not turn his mind to any action against the respondent until he
    was contacted by a lawyer.  This was
    shortly before June 30, 2004, when notice was actually given.  The trial judge made no adverse finding or
    comment about the credibility of either the appellant or his witnesses.  Nor does the record suggest any basis for
    doing so.  What remains is the
    uncontested evidence called by the appellant to explain why he did not give
    notice until June 30, 2004.  The question
    is whether that evidence constitutes reasonable excuse, a question which is
    essentially legal, not factual, and is something this court is able to
    address.  A new trial is not needed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant evidence begins with the appellant
    himself.  He was born in England in 1956,
    and was 48 years old in the spring of 2004.  He lived with his wife and son, who <span class=GramE>was</span> then
    17.  After high school, the appellant
    went to catering college for two years and obtained his trades papers as a
    qualified chef.  That has been his only
    occupation, first in England, then Bermuda, and since 1982 in Canada, where he
    has worked as an executive <span class=SpellE>sous</span> chef or executive
    chef in Toronto at several French restaurants and institutional restaurants
    such as the Fitness Institute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the accident, the appellant was the
    executive chef at Lula Lounge, a restaurant with a seating capacity of
    approximately 140 people.  He was a
    working chef whose job required long hours on his feet and extensive
    mobility.  While he had no ownership
    stake in the restaurant at the time, he had discussed becoming a partner with
    the owners of the restaurant.  This was
    something he was really looking forward to.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The injury suffered by the appellant on February 4 was
    significant.  The emergency room doctor
    advised that he had dislocated and broken his ankle.  Two days later, he was operated on and a
    permanent screw was inserted to repair his ankle.  He remained in hospital until February 8,
    heavily sedated to control post-operative pain.  For the two weeks following his release, he was given Percocet, which
    the expert evidence described as rendering his state of mind severely impaired
    for that period and several days beyond.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was in a cast for 12 weeks after the
    accident which left him very much restricted and with limited mobility.  Once his cast was removed, he was placed on
    an intensive physiotherapy program for another 12 weeks that occupied him for
    approximately 40 hours per week.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About two months after the accident, the appellant began
    making occasional visits to the Lula Lounge.  Because of his very restricted mobility, he could only sit on a chair in
    the kitchen and observe.  His <span
class=SpellE>sous</span> chef had taken over his work.  It was not until the end of that summer that
    the appellant was able to resume any of his previous responsibilities.  However, even at the time of trial, he had
    not fully resumed the hands-on preparation of entrees that was a significant
    part of his work before the accident.  Both he and the owners realized that he would never be able to take on
    the partnership role they had previously discussed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not surprisingly, the severity of the appellant’s
    injury, the intensive therapy it required, the resulting impact on his job, and
    the threat all this posed to his future career and his ability to provide for
    his family had a real impact on his mental health.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, his son, and the general manager of Lula
    Lounge gave evidence about the appellant’s resulting mental state through to
    the summer of 2004.  The appellant
    described feeling anxious, confused, depressed, and worried about his position
    at the restaurant, his potential inability to go back to his occupation as a
    chef, and whether he would be able to look after his wife and son and their
    house.  He was deeply concerned that his
    career, including a possible partnership in the restaurant, was going to be
    taken away from him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His son described the appellant as being very down and
    irritable during this period, keeping mostly to himself and confined mostly to
    one room in the house.  Prior to the
    accident, he had been active and communicative.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general manager described someone who went from
    being extremely energetic and gregarious before the accident to being very
    quiet and depressed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These descriptions of the appellant’s state of mind are
    consistent with his evidence that despite his efforts to overcome his emotional
    difficulties, they persisted and finally resulted in his family doctor
    prescribing <span class=SpellE>Lorazepam</span> for him in November.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acknowledged that he simply did not know
    that he was required to give notice to the City within ten days, and that he
    ultimately did so when he was contacted by a lawyer.  Given his mental state and the reasons for it,
    it is hardly surprising that until then, he did not turn his mind to it.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken together, this evidence describes a man who
    suffered a serious injury requiring a prolonged period of rehabilitation,
    during which he was deeply worried about his job, his ability to provide for
    his family, and whether he would ever be able to return to the only career he
    had known.  He was understandably depressed.  In these circumstances, not knowing he was
    required give notice to the respondent, it was reasonable that he did not do so
    until the end of June.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the appellant has established
    reasonable excuse for the purposes of s. 44(12).  Since the respondent does not assert any
    prejudice to its defence, we conclude that the appellant’s action is not barred
    by s. 44(10) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We now consider whether the appellant has established
    gross negligence on the part of the City.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        THE GROSS
    NEGLIGENCE ISSUE<u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge misunderstood the
    appellant’s position on the issue of gross negligence.  Accordingly, his decision is not entitled to
    deference.  Indeed, as will be
    demonstrated below, the evidence clearly supports a finding of gross
    negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the sidewalk salting began
    at 2:00 p.m. on February 4, 2004 and that it would take 12 hours to cover the
    relevant area.  He concluded that the
    City was not grossly negligent because the appellant’s injury occurred at 9:00
    p.m., before the salting could be finished.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>However, this was not the appellant’s position at trial.  The appellant did not argue that the salting </span>should
    have been done faster; he argued that the salting should have been started
    earlier.  He relied on evidence that the
    roads were salted the previous day because the patrollers were concerned about
    icy conditions.  In other words, the
    critical issue was whether the City was grossly negligent by not salting the
    sidewalks until well after the roads were addressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the trial judge did not appreciate the
    appellant’s position at trial, he did not make the factual findings necessary
    to determine the issue.  The findings
    that he did make – namely, that the City began its response at 2:00 p.m. on
    February 4, 2004 and took 12 hours to finish – do not undermine the appellant’s
    argument.  </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>1.         Definition of Gross Negligence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 44(9) of the Act provides: “Except in case of
    gross negligence, a municipality is not liable for a personal injury caused by
    snow or ice on a sidewalk.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gross negligence has a long history in the municipal
    law context as has the search for a definition.  In the seminal case of <span class=SpellE><i>Drennan</i></span><i> v. Kingston
    (City) </i>(1897), 27 S.C.R. 46 at p. 60, <span class=SpellE>Sedgewick</span> J. defined gross negligence as “very great negligence”.  More recently this court rejected the
    argument “that gross negligence in this context requires proof of misconduct
    that is wilful, wanton or flagrant”: <span class=SpellE><i>Dagenais</i></span><i> v. Timmins
    (City) </i>(1995), 31 M.P.L.R. (2d) 196 (Ont. C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A review of jurisprudence discloses that the courts
    have not defined gross negligence with any degree of linguistic precision.  However, it is clear that there must be more
    than a breach of a duty of care; the breach must rise to a level that can
    properly be described as gross negligence.  Although a precise definition may be elusive, courts are nonetheless equipped
    to decide the issue of gross negligence.  As noted by O’Connor J. in <i>McNulty
    v. Brampton (City)</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 3240 (S.C.) at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… [T]o a great extent, the determination of gross
    negligence depends on the facts of each case.  It depends on the application of a less than precise definition of gross
    negligence, interpreted through the prism of common sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As O’Connor J. notes, the salient point is that gross
    negligence is a question to be decided on the facts of each case.  </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>2.         Application to this case</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most compelling evidence at trial comes from three
    City witnesses: <span class=SpellE>Raynor</span> Wilmot, a maintenance
    patrolman for the City; Brian Carroll, a supervisor of repair for the City of
    Toronto Transportation Services Department; and Rosario <span class=SpellE>Carnovale</span>,
    the District Superintendent for Road Operations responsible for the
    sidewalks.  The totality of their
    evidence at trial establishes several important facts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the City’s goal was to be proactive and take
    steps to prevent dangerous conditions.  However, icy conditions on sidewalks were addressed only if the City
    received a complaint from a resident or if the supervisor, in his discretion,
    believed that the conditions warranted remedial action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the supervisors obtained their knowledge of the
    sidewalk conditions from one of three sources: City patrollers who drove the
    streets; weather forecasts; and, on occasion, their own observations if they
    left the office to inspect the sidewalks themselves.  The patrollers were authorized to call out salt
    or sand trucks for the roads, but not the sidewalks.  The sidewalks were exclusively the domain of
    the supervisors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conduct of the City must be evaluated against the
    background of these policies, such as they are.  A review of the evidence at trial establishes the following:</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    City patroller called out the road <span class=SpellE>salters</span> on
    February 3, 2004 at 3:55 a.m. because he was concerned about dangerous road
    conditions.  He acknowledged that these
    conditions would exist “as much on the road as on the sidewalk”; </span></p>

    the sidewalk maintenance began.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the evidence at trial established that almost
    34 hours elapsed from the time the City became aware <span style='line-height:200%'>of dangerous sidewalk conditions and when it
    responded.  T</span>he City offered no
    explanation for why the sidewalks were not addressed on the morning of February
    3, 2004 when the City first became concerned about the weather, although the
    roads received significant attention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has long been the law in Ontario that if a
    municipality permits a slippery, icy sidewalk in a busy area of the city to
    remain unprotected or ignores it altogether and someone is injured, that would
    constitute gross negligence: see <span class=SpellE><i>Huycke</i></span><i> v. <span
class=SpellE>Coburg</span> (Municipality)</i>, [1937] O.R. 682 (Ont. C.A.) at
    690.  A city must take reasonable steps
    to keep the sidewalks free of dangerous conditions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the evidence clearly establishes that the
    reasonable steps required of the City in this case were to commence the
    sidewalk salting earlier, in the same manner that the road <span class=SpellE>salters</span> were sent out because the patrollers were concerned about icy conditions.  The failure to do so amounts to gross
    negligence.</p>
