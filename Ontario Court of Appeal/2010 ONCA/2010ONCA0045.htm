  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Kipfinch Developments Ltd. (“Kipfinch”)
    entered into an agreement on April 16, 2004 to purchase the Westwood Mall from
    the respondent Westwood Mall (Mississauga) Limited (“Westwood”).  Thirty percent of the Mall was empty,
    presenting the appellant with the opportunity to revitalize and lease-up an
    additional 90,000 square feet.  The
    agreement entitled Kipfinch to carry out environmental testing as part of its
    due diligence.  It also provided that
    unless Kipfinch gave notice that its due diligence entitlement was satisfied or
    waived by June 15, 2004(later extended to June 16, 2004), the agreement would
    terminate at that point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2004, Westwood declined to permit Kipfinch to
    carry out its environmental testing and as a result the agreement came to an
    end on June 16, 2004.  Kipfinch then sued
    Westwood for breach of contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wilton-Siegel J. concluded that Westwood breached its
    contractual obligation by refusing to allow Kipfinch to conduct its
    environmental testing.  On appeal,
    Westwood does not challenge this finding, and the appeal proceeded on the basis
    of Westwood’s liability for damages for breach of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge determined damages by applying the
    principle of lost chance.  He found that
    the breach caused Kipfinch the loss of the contractual opportunity to close the
    transaction.  He determined that had the
    breach not occurred, Kipfinch would have had a 50 per cent probability of
    closing the transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then quantified the damages Kipfinch
    suffered.  He did so as of the date the
    agreement terminated, using a discounted cash flow methodology, but he excluded
    the recovery of certain management expenses that Kipfinch argued it would have
    been able to pass on to the tenants.  He
    concluded that if the transaction had closed, Kipfinch would have realized the
    profit or gain of approximately $660,000.  Given the 50 per cent probability of closing, he awarded damages to
    Kipfinch in the amount of $330,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, Kipfinch raises four challenges to these
    findings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s first challenge is to the finding that,
    had the breach not occurred, there was a 50 per cent chance that the
    transaction would have closed.  It argues
    that this conclusion constitutes a palpable and overriding error of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge examined
    three separate contingencies that each constituted a risk to the successful
    conclusion of the transaction: the risk that Kipfinch’s environmental testing
    could not be successfully completed due to physical conditions; the risk that
    this testing would not delineate environmental contamination sufficiently to
    allow a satisfactory report to Kipfinch’s lenders; and the risk that the
    testing would reveal contamination that exceeded the threshold considered
    acceptable by the lenders.  On the basis
    of expert evidence, the trial judge evaluated each risk to be not merely
    speculative, but instead a real, although not significant, possibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not contest these individual
    findings, nor is there any basis to do so.  Rather, the appellant submits that, taken together, they do not justify
    the conclusion that the transaction had a 50 per cent chance of closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.  The trial judge simply took three small but separate risks that the
    transaction would fail and accumulated them to reach his conclusion that there
    was a 50 per cent chance of failure, which he then expressed in positive terms
    as a 50 per cent possibility that the transaction would close.  He did not err in proceeding in this way.  His conclusion of a 50 per cent possibility
    of closing is not a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also attacks this conclusion by saying
    that the trial judge should have applied the principle of <i>omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem</i> (i.e., everything is presumed
    against the wrongdoer) where the nature of the wrong makes it difficult for a
    plaintiff to establish a loss.  The
    appellant states that this principle required the trial judge to discount
    Westwood’s expert evidence on the three risks to the transaction, because
    Westwood prevented Kipfinch from establishing the facts with certainty when it
    prevented Kipfinch from conducting environmental testing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again we disagree.  The issue addressed here was causation: was the lost chance caused by
    the appellant’s breach of contract?  On
    this issue, the appellant can get no assistance from the above legal principle.  The appellant could not rely on any presumption,
    but was required to prove on a balance of probabilities that its projections of
    risk were a close approximation of what would have occurred had the contract
    been performed: see: <i>Ticketnet Corp. v.
    Air Canada</i> (1997), 154 D.L.R. (4th) 271 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 84.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While, in an appropriate case, the principle can be
    relied on by a plaintiff when the issue is the quantification of damages, that
    is not what the appellant seeks here.  The respondent’s refusal to permit the
    appellant to do environmental testing is simply irrelevant to the task of
    quantifying the value of the 50 per cent chance that the transaction would
    close.  The principle has no application
    to the quantification of damages in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second challenge is to the trial
    judge’s assessment of damages as of the date the transaction terminated, rather
    than a date two years later when the leasing-up of the empty space would have
    been completed.  Use of the later date
    would encompass the general increase in property values that occurred over those
    two years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the way the trial judge proceeded.  The general rule is that contract damages are
    assessed at the date of breach: see: <i>Kinbauri
    Gold Corp. v. IAMGOLD International African Mining Gold Corp.</i> (2004), 246 D.L.R.
    (4th) 595 (Ont. C.A.).  Moreover, the
    trial judge found as a fact that the general increase in property values was
    not in the contemplation of the parties when they made the agreement.  There is no basis to interfere with the trial
    judge’s use of the June 2004 date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s third challenge is to the trial judge’s
    assessment of damages based on a discounted cash flow methodology.  However, there was ample expert evidence to
    support his conclusion that this most accurately quantified the loss.  There is no basis to interfere with this
    finding of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in excluding the recovery of certain management expenses from the
    quantification of damages.  The trial
    judge did so because he found that the capital expenditures contemplated by the
    appellant were to be amortized and charged to the tenants over the first five
    years of the project, thereby creating tenant resistance to also paying certain
    management expenses that Kipfinch sought to pass on to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that the trial judge based
    his conclusion on a misapprehension of the evidence, although it is fair to say
    that this evidence was presented less clearly than it might have been.  The capital expenditures were in fact to be
    amortized and charged to the tenants over nine years, not five years.  In at least some of those nine years, these
    amounts were projected to be considerably lower than would have resulted from
    the five-year period used by the trial judge.  Arguably this would reduce tenant resistance to paying for additional
    management expenses, and possibly allow recovery by Kipfinch of expenses
    excluded by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would therefore set aside the trial judge’s decision
    to exclude the recovery of certain management expenses from the quantification
    of damages, since it was based on a misapprehension of the evidence.  We would direct a new trial on the issue of
    the recovery of management expenses, as both parties suggested we should if we
    reached this conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is allowed on this issue, but
    is otherwise dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent has succeeded on three issues, and the
    appellant on one.  In these
    circumstances, we would award the respondent half of its partial indemnity
    costs which we would fix at $12,500 all inclusive.  We would leave the trial costs unaltered, but
    leave to the new trial judge the costs of the issue that we have ordered to be
    tried.  </p>
