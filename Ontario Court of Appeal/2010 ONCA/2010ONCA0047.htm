    by the Chiefs of Ontario and the Ontario First Nations Limited Partnership,
    oppose MFN’s claim.  They argue that the Site
    Selection Process was just that – a site selection process – and that revenue
    sharing as between all of Ontario’s First Nations, including the host’s share,
    was to be negotiated in a separate round of negotiations following site
    selection that would embrace a broader and more representative group of First
    Nation interests.</p>

    did not result in a binding agreement between MFN and Ontario entitling MFN to
    a 35% share of net revenues from Casino Rama.  In that regard, he found that a reasonable person, viewing the evidence
    objectively, would not have concluded that a binding agreement on revenue
    sharing was to, or did, result from the Site Selection Process.  In addition, he found that MFN’s
    representatives never subjectively believed they had such a contract. He also
    rejected MFN’s fiduciary duty argument.</p>

    a perception of bias and that he intervened in the conduct of the trial in such
    a way that the trial process itself was irreparably tainted with
    unfairness.  MFN also asserts numerous
    legal errors, including those relating to the law of fiduciary obligations and
    the application of contractual and tender law jurisprudence, the trial judge’s
    alleged failure to consider and appreciate the cultural background and unique
    Aboriginal perspective of MFN’s witnesses, and the insufficiency of his

    negotiations with First Nations for the development of casino gambling on a
    First Nation site.  The purpose was to
    generate revenues and to establish a vehicle to enhance the growth and capacity
    of all Ontario First Nations in the areas of economic development, community
    development, cultural development, health, education, training and management.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario had entered the field of commercial
    casino gambling in 1992, announcing the first pilot casino for the City of
    Windsor and enacting the <i>Gaming Control
    Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 24.  In part,
    the Government’s initiative was in response to concerns raised by
    municipalities throughout the province over the perceived lack of control over
    commercial gaming and the perceived growth of unlicensed gambling, including gambling
    on <i>Indian Act</i> reserves.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In April 1993, the Government decided to take
    the initiative a step further.  It
    announced that it would enter into negotiations with Ontario’<span lang=EN-US>s</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>First Nations to
    permit casino gambling on First Nation reserves, that the negotiations would
    take place collectively under an “umbrella structure,” and that items subject
    to negotiation would include the number of casinos that would be established,
    the regulatory framework governing them, and revenue sharing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The negotiations took place between May 1993 and
    February 1994.  Although not described as
    such in the Agreed Statement, they evolved in the context of what were known as
    the Aboriginal Gaming Section (“AGS”) meetings.  From September 1993 onwards, the AGS meetings were chaired by the principal
    Government representative, John <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span>.  <span class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> negotiating authority came directly from (and was circumscribed by) Cabinet

    contractual rights and obligations arose as between MFN and Ontario respecting

    was ultimate agreement that the establishment of the pilot First Nation casino
    would proceed on the following grounds:</p>

    anticipated receiving some of the net revenue from the casino beyond cost

    retreated from that position when <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> announced,
    at an AGS meeting in February 1994, that Ontario would be “revenue neutral”
    with respect to casino profits.  Minister <span class=SpellE>Churley</span>, the Minister of Consumer and Commercial
    Relations at the time, and Minister Wildman, then Minister of Native Affairs, confirmed
    that position at a later meeting. </p>

    negotiations, Ontario and the participating First Nations agreed upon a set of
    selection criteria, to be applied by an independent selection panel (the “Selection
    Panel”) in deciding which First Nation would be the host of the pilot First
    Nation casino.  What they do not agree
    upon is whether those selection criteria dictated that the host First Nation’s
    revenue share was to be determined by the Selection Panel as part of the site
    selection process. </p>

    Nations was a prominent subject of discussion at the AGS meeting of October 20,
    1993.  One representative – Joe Hare of
    the West Bay First Nation – held out for the U.S. model of Aboriginal gaming,
    namely one where the host First Nation keeps most, if not all, the
    revenues.  This proposal was completely
    unacceptable to Ontario, partly because of Ontario’s policy of limiting the
    number of commercial Aboriginal gaming casinos to the single pilot site to be
    determined.  It was also unacceptable to
    others at the meeting. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that prior to this meeting
    there was no consensus on the extent of revenue sharing, or on how any specific
    plans for revenue sharing would play out in the proposal process itself.  He also found that at the end of the meeting,
    no agreement had been reached on whether the revenue sharing formula would
    include a pre-determined share for the host First Nation, since the Province
    never accepted such a concept. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What happened following the October 20 meeting
    is important.  The First Nations
    negotiating team, through Deputy Grand Chief Vernon <span class=SpellE>Roote</span> of the UOI, circulated a letter professing to confirm an agreement reached at
    the meeting and attaching a list of criteria with certain descriptors for the Site
    Selection Process.  <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> responded by letter dated October 27, 1993.  In it, he noted the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While agreement in principle was reached on the <u>site
    selection categories</u> set out in [Deputy Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Roote’s</span> letter], some First Nations expressed concern with a number of individual
    recommendations.  Specifically, First
    Nations suggested that the descriptions of several of the recommendations were
    too specific and would disqualify any First Nation that could not meet them
    from submitting a casino proposal. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Attached to this letter was a table setting out <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> list of criteria and descriptors pertaining to the
    Site Selection Process (together “Exhibit 25”).  The table had two columns – a left-hand column entitled “Criteria
    Categories” and a right-hand column entitled “Suggested Criteria Elements for
    Evaluation Purposes”.  We shall refer to
    the “Criteria Categories” in the left-hand column, as the “<span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria”.   They became a central
    feature of the evidence because the trial judge relied on them in arriving at
    his factual finding that revenue sharing remained an issue to be determined
    after the Site Selection Process had been completed.</p>

    some differences in the descriptions of various criteria (the right-hand column
    items), as well as a key difference in the reference to the “revenue sharing” criterion

    to the December 14 AGS meeting.  AGS
    staff prepared and distributed a document entitled “Policy Objectives, Site
    Selection Criteria and Other Issues for a First Pilot Casino in Ontario” (the
    “Policy Objectives”).  This document was
    marked as Exhibit 45 and became a focal point at trial; the trial judge cited
    it at length.  For present purposes, we
    need only refer to the following statement that it contained about the site
    selection criteria:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An impartial selection panel is being established
    from nominations submitted by First Nations.  The selection panel will use the policy objectives and criteria (in the
    left hand column <i>of the attached document</i>)
    to evaluate site proposals.  The right
    hand column contains <u>suggested</u> elements of the criteria which were
    provided by First Nations.  The elements

    an “accurate reflection of those discussions that took place [at the November
    18 AGS Meeting]” where the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria were first
    discussed.  This, even though he had
    earlier rejected the suggestion that the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria
    had been agreed to.  At trial, Gordon
    Baker, the lawyer who had advised MFN in its casino dealings, testified that the
    Policy Objectives – including the attached <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria – constituted the request for proposal (“RFP”) upon which the
    appellant founded its RFP/tender argument.  In closing submissions at trial, MFN’s counsel described the Policy
    Objectives and their attachment as “the most accurate and authoritative
    ‘criteria document’ in evidence.”  The
    trial judge found that MFN accepted the validity of the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria and that the Policy Objectives document was sent to all First Nations
    as the authoritative criteria document.</p>

    in helping to set the stage for our analysis of the issues raised by the
    appellant. They were held on February 8 and February 24.  These meetings were not devoted to the issue
    of the criteria for the Site Selection Process.  Instead, they dealt with a number of issues,
    including a proposal put forward by <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> at the
    February 8 meeting that Ontario would take a share of the net profits from the
    casino revenues.  This proposal created
    what the trial judge referred to as a “firestorm” and, at the February 24

    would remain “revenue neutral” with respect to the profits and would look only

    exclusively to the host First Nation but would be shared among all First
    Nations according to a formula to be developed by the First Nations without

    revenue sharing.  As the trial judge
    succinctly put it, the February Proposal was “singularly silent” on that
    subject.  In particular, it said nothing
    about MFN receiving 35% – or any amount – of the net revenues from the
    casino.  MFN was content to leave revenue
    sharing to a couple of oblique references in accompanying letters to Minister <span

    simply “gave a little overview and kind of generally said, yeah, we’re hoping

    proposal was not determinative, but merely “a basis for discussion” and that
    all parties “wish[<span class=SpellE>ed</span>] to remain flexible”.  MFN had little input into the preparation of
    this revenue sharing proposal.  Williams
    – the Band Manager and point man for the site selection negotiations –
    acknowledged that he had no input and had not seen the letter until after it
    was submitted.  Chief Stinson testified
    that the split suggested between MFN and the other First Nations was “very
    generous and very good for everybody involved at the time”, but that the
    overall proposal was “very scary” because of the amount of the revenues going
    to the operator.</p>

    that MFN was one of three finalists for the position of host First Nation.  In the meantime, two significant events
    occurred.  First, Chief Stinson and MFN’s
    Council were replaced in office by Chief Lorraine McRae and a new Council.  Chief McRae was not a supporter of the casino
    quest but committed to be bound by a plebiscite on the issue.  In the plebiscite, the community answered “yes”
    to the question: “Do you want a casino-resort operating on the <span

    First Nation?”  </p>

    about the July Proposal put forward by Bally’s at the various community meetings
    held during this process.  While the
    trial judge found “some evidence that the 35% figure was bandied about from
    time to time,” it was unhelpful because it was unclear against what benchmark
    the percentage was being applied (gross or net revenues) and the trial judge
    was not satisfied that anyone really understood “the math, the economic impact
    the casino would have on the community, or whether [as MFN’s witness, Byron
    Styles, testified] the revenue discussion was merely ‘pie in the sky’.”</p>

    and last, site visit from the Selection Panel.  During that visit, the Selection Panel was presented with a revised MFN
    revenue sharing proposal (the “November Proposal”).  The spreadsheet included in the November
    Proposal contained a revenue sharing formula.  It was prepared by Williams and MFN’s financial officer, Jeff <span

    visit, and then presented to the Selection Panel as they were leaving.  There was no discussion with the Selection

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Revenue Sharing Meetings stretched on through 1997.  As we shall outline later, MFN failed to
    articulate at any of the Revenue Sharing Meetings that it had anything other
    than a “draft” proposal – subject to negotiation – whereby it would receive a
    35% share of net revenues from the casino operations.</p>

    this period, MFN and Ontario – through the Ontario Casino Corporation – were
    working out matters relating to the operation of the casino, including the
    choice of operator.  The documentation
    prepared in this regard – with MFN’s direct input – included a draft and a
    final RFP for the selection of the operator, a draft tripartite Memorandum of
    Agreement designed to confirm the role and responsibilities of the parties
    involved in the casino, and the final DOA with an accompanying “Side Letter”

    and 1997, the revenue sharing issues came to a head at the AOCCs.  In June 1996, MFN asked for the Chiefs’
    approval of a 35%/65% split of net revenues, and after much debate a
    declaration was passed at the AOCC to that effect.  The duration of that agreement was left for
    further discussion and, at the June 1997 AOCC, a deal was reached among First
    Nations that MFN was to receive 35% of net revenues for a five-year
    period.  Ontario ultimately accepted that
    arrangement.</p>

    (1) there was no agreement between Ontario and First Nations to have the Selection
    Panel determine the share of casino revenues to flow to the successful host
    First Nation; (2) conversely, there was an agreement that revenue sharing
    between the host First Nation and the other First Nations would be negotiated
    separately, after site selection, at a different negotiating table with a
    larger representation of First Nations; (3) there was no contract entered into
    between MFN and Ontario as a result of the AGS meetings and the Site Selection Process,
    or thereafter, entitling MFN to a 35% share of net revenues from the casino;

    made numerous other palpable and overriding errors of fact in arriving at them.  MFN seeks to rest its attack on the trial
    judge’s conclusions on a wide variety of alleged evidence-addressing
    errors.  For purposes of this analysis,

    fact-finding errors allegedly made by the trial judge – globally and
    cumulatively and, in some cases, individually – serve to undermine the four
    critical findings summarized above.  In
    addressing these concerns, we do not propose to examine every one of the more
    than 100 fact-finding errors raised.  Nor
    will we address them by legal category because the numerous errors invoked by
    the appellant – particularly in the various “heads” of evidence-weighing and evidence-assessing
    flaws – are common to a number of areas.  Rather, we will begin with some general observations respecting the
    fact-finding errors and follow those observations with an analysis of some of
    the more robustly contested conclusions made by the trial judge, in the context
    of the four principal findings outlined above.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We say at the outset that in our view the record
    amply confirms the findings of fact and credibility made by the trial
    judge.  The appellant’s essential
    complaint is the trial judge’s failure to accept MFN’s interpretation of the
    evidence.  In substance, MFN seeks to
    have us retry the case, something an appellate court is not entitled to do.  As this Court explained in <i>Waxman</i>, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    294-295, deference to the findings of fact made by the trial judge is
    particularly important in lengthy and factually complex cases:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]<span class=SpellE>ppellate</span> judges are
    very much like the blind men in the parable of the blind men and the
    elephant.  <span class=GramE>Counsel invite</span> the court to carefully examine isolated parts of the evidence, but the court
    cannot possibly see and comprehend the whole of the narrative. Like the inapt
    comparisons to the whole of the elephant made by the blind men who felt only
    one small part of the beast, appellate fact-finding is not likely to reflect an
    accurate appreciation of the entirety of the narrative. This case demonstrates
    that the “palpable and overriding” standard of review is a realistic reflection
    of the limitations and pitfalls inherent in appellate fact-finding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Despite the benefit of detailed reasons for
    judgment, lengthy and effective argument by counsel, and many hours of study,
    we are entirely satisfied that we cannot possibly know and understand this
    trial record in the way that the trial judge came to know and understand it.
    Her factual determinations are much more likely to be accurate than any that we
    might make.</p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>None of the documentary evidence relied upon by
    MFN reflects the existence of an agreement with Ontario on revenue sharing. The
    words relied upon by MFN in the documents are ambiguous and capable of being
    interpreted in multiple ways.   As we
    will explain later, it does not follow in this <i>Aboriginal</i> <i>versus</i> <i>Aboriginal</i> litigation that these
    ambiguities must be resolved in favour of MFN.  Moreover, the testimony of the MFN witnesses
    (which the trial judge did not accept) was refuted by other evidence from the
    main players involved in the AGS meetings and the Site Selection Process (much
    of it from other Aboriginal witnesses, whose testimony the trial judge did
    accept).  It was therefore open to the
    trial judge to make the findings that he did.</p>

    the AGS meetings, the subsequent Site Selection Process and the post-selection
    period.  We are satisfied the evidence,
    read as a whole, confirms the trial judge’s findings.  In support of their contention to the
    contrary, however, MFN points to several particular alleged errors.  The following are some of the more contentious.</p>
  <h4><a name="_Toc251669426">a)<span

class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN submits the trial judge erred in finding
    that the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria relating to revenue sharing
    “purported to include a qualifier,” namely that  revenue sharing “<i>[would]</i> <i>be subject to ongoing negotiations</i>” (emphasis
    added).  The appellant contends that the
    criterion was “Revenue Sharing” simply, and that this meant revenue sharing as
    determined in the Site Selection Process.  Its position is set out in para. 39 of its factum as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Williams testified that, at the AGS Meeting of
    October 20, 1993, all parties agreed that “Revenue Sharing” would be dealt with
    through site proposals.  In other words,
    the proportion of revenue that a bidding First Nation was prepared to
    contribute to other First Nations through the “Fund” would be expressed in
    their proposals, and evaluated by the body appointed to select a winner.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We note in passing that MFN did not adhere to
    this apparent requisite when it submitted its February Proposal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that there was some evidence with
    respect to the AGS meeting process that might have supported the appellant’s contention.  But the trial judge did not accept it.  MFN argues, nonetheless, that he committed a
    palpable and overriding error in finding that the Qualifier applied to the
    “Revenue Sharing” criterion and that there was an agreement that revenue
    sharing would be dealt with later, through First Nations’ negotiations at a
    more broadly constituted table.  It says
    this is so principally because the trial judge failed to take into account <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> admission on discovery (which was read in at
    trial) that the “Qualifier” was never agreed to by the First Nations.  They contend that the error tainted the
    balance of the trial judge’s analysis in other respects.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This attack cannot survive a careful reading of
    the alleged admission and the evidence given at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On discovery, <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> was asked about the Qualifier and his letter
    of October 27, 1993, in comparison to the predecessor letter from Deputy Grand
    Chief <span class=SpellE>Roote</span> dated October 22, 1993.  He was asked these questions in the context
    of matters arising out of the October 20, 1993 AGS meeting.  The central question he was asked that gives
    rise to the alleged admission was, “[w]<span class=SpellE>ould</span> you agree
    with me, sir, that there was no agreement <i>at
    the October 20th meeting </i>that that language would be included in the site
    selection criteria?” (Emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    answer was correct.  There was no such
    agreement at the October 20 meeting.  Both Deputy Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Roote’s</span> October 22 letter
    and <span class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> October 27 letter postdate that
    meeting.  The agreement respecting the <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria could only have developed later.  MFN argues that none did, except for revenue
    sharing (unqualified with respect to subsequent negotiations) as one of the
    “broad criteria.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for MFN returned to this same subject on
    other occasions during <span class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> discovery.   And indeed, there are portions of <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> testimony both on discovery (as read in at trial)
    and at <span class=GramE>trial that are</span> capable of supporting a finding
    that he conceded there was no agreement on the Qualifier.  Equally, however, there was ample basis in <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> testimony, and the evidence as a whole, to support
    the conclusion that revenue sharing was to be the subject of further
    negotiation, as the Qualifier stated. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For example, <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> said in cross-examination that where they ended up, in his view, was that there
    was acceptance of the left-hand side of the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> list, with “a sort of permissive approach on the other side.”  He and Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> both testified that the criteria in the left-hand column of the table – including
    the Qualifier – were accepted by the First Nations, although they agreed there
    were discussions during this period about the descriptors in the right-hand
    column.  <span class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> evidence was that he heard “not one thing from anybody on that parenthetical reference
    [the Qualifier].”  The criteria described
    in the table became the operative criteria, he said.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> echoed <span class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> evidence on this point and
    acknowledged that revenue sharing was to be the subject of future
    negotiations.  “While revenue sharing …
    may very well be addressed in the submissions,” and “proponents might be able
    to give us some guidance on how they saw [revenue sharing]”, he said, at the
    end of the day:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]e knew that [it] had to all be vetted and it
    would all have to be examined and it would all have to be discussed and
    debated, and in the end it would, in [all] likelihood, culminate in an All
    Ontario Chiefs meeting where there would be, again, debate and discussion and
    other proposals perhaps put forward, and subcommittees for that, but eventually
    we would have to come to a decision which would be the Chiefs of Ontario which
    would make that finalized decision.  </p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN further submits the trial judge erred in
    finding that “[n]one of the First Nations representatives took issue” with the
    Qualifier at the AGS meeting on November 18, 1993.  Counsel points to the minutes of the meeting
    and to the testimony confirming that Deputy Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Roote</span> indicated at the meeting “that the UOI did not agree with the descriptions of
    the criteria in the revised working document” (i.e., the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> letter of October 27 and attached table containing the criteria) and that “it
    required further clarification”.  Indeed,
    MFN says that <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> himself acknowledged this in a
    follow up letter dated November 25, 1993, where he wrote, “[w]<span
class=SpellE>hile</span> some First Nations indicated concern or disagreement
    with the document’s proposed description of certain criteria elements, Ontario
    and First Nations did agree in principle that the broad categories … should
    form the basis of proposals.”</p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, as the respondents point out, that
    evidence referred to a disagreement over the<i> descriptions </i>of the criteria contained in the right-hand column of the <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria, not over the criteria themselves, as
    listed in the left-hand column.  The <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> and <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> testimony
    cited above confirms this, and the trial judge was entitled to accept that
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge recognized that “[t]he parties’
    understanding of [the Qualifier], and whether [it] formed part of the
    agreed-upon criteria, were central issues in [the] lawsuit.”  He addressed the issue directly.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We are satisfied on a reading of the <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> evidence as a whole – taken together with the abundance
    of other evidence accepted by the trial judge – that the trial judge made no
    error in finding, as he did, that there was ultimate agreement on the <span
class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria (including the Qualifier), and that revenue
    sharing would be the subject of post-selection negotiations among First Nations
    at a more representative negotiating table.  In our view, the “admission” relied upon by the appellant is not clear,
    when taken in its entire context, and the trial judge was entitled to proceed by
    resolving the Qualifier issue on the basis of his assessment of the conflicting
    testimony he had in front of him and in making the credibility findings and
    factual findings that he did. <u></u></p>

    asserts that the trial judge erred by ignoring what it calls a “consensus
    draft” on the site selection criteria, prepared by First Nations
    representatives on December 3, 1993.  Counsel
    submits this was an important piece of evidence confirming an agreement that
    revenue sharing was an important criterion with no qualifying language.  This document listed “revenue sharing” as one
    of the three “major elements” of the site selection criteria, the other two
    being marketability and profitability, and suggested proposed weightings for
    the various criteria.  With respect to
    the revenue sharing criteria, it proposed a weighting scale of 1 to 50 and
    said: “[t]he casino project must apply a certain percentage (i.e. 20% net
    profit) to a capital development fund for the First Nations to access for
    infrastructure development.”</p>

    3 document was a “consensus draft”, however.  The document was a product of a technical committee meeting.  The Grand Chief of the UOI at the time, Joe <span

    ongoing debate”.  <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> said the proposed weightings were not accepted at the AGS meetings, and Williams

    of much discussion at the AGS meeting in December, “it [did] not appear that it
    was given to, or relied on, by the Panel during the course of its
    deliberations.”  We see no error in this

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In September 1994, there was a UOI-organized
    meeting of First Nations to address concerns raised by representatives of the
    Georgina Island First Nation arising out of its early elimination from the Site
    Selection Process.  The complaint was
    that Georgina Island had understood there would be a two-step process – the
    first focusing on selection of the physical site and the second on the other
    criteria including revenue sharing.  The
    representatives at the meeting were polled about their understanding concerning
    the “two-staged” process and, according to Williams, who was at the meeting,
    all proponents, except the Georgina Island representatives, agreed on a single
    process, leading to a single decision, based on “full-blown proposals.”  </p>

    MFN, support its position about the site selection and RFP process, but the
    trial judge, without reasoning or explanation, “rejected the MFN witnesses’
    interpretation” of the meeting as hearsay that was “of little or no moment.”  The appellant contends that the evidence was
    not hearsay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    context in which the trial judge’s remarks were made was with respect to his
    finding about the Selection Panel’s mandate – an important finding, to be
    sure.  He writes: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, I accept the evidence of <span
class=SpellE>Altin</span> Paulson, the Panel chairperson, as it relates to his
    understanding of the Panel’s mandate.  Mr. Paulson testified that he understood and believed that his mandate
    was limited to site selection, albeit based on a consideration and application
    of the negotiated <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria, and that the Panel
    had no mandate to negotiate a revenue-sharing agreement.  I have come to this conclusion based on his
    evidence taken as a whole, and considered in light of the documentary evidence
    to which I previously made reference.  In
    so doing, I have rejected the MFN witnesses’ interpretation of a September 1994
    meeting, at which members of the Georgina Island proposed group (“Consortium”)
    were heard to complain about their early elimination from the selection
    process.  <i>The hearsay evidence I received was, in the final analysis, of little
    or no moment in discerning the collective mindset of the Consortium, </i>which
    was, as well, not assisted by the evidence of then Chief Nora <span

    finding.  First, it was open to the trial
    judge to accept Paulson’s testimony based on his testimony as a whole,
    supported as it was by the documentary and other evidence on the record.  Secondly, it was open to him to reject the
    MFN witnesses’ interpretation of what went on at the meeting, based on the same
    and other evidence.  Thirdly, the
    evidence consisted of testimony given by Williams and Chief <span class=SpellE>Bothwell</span>-Sawyer
    about statements made by others at the meeting who were not called as

    have rejected the testimony of the MFN witnesses regarding the meeting and the
    whole question of the Selection Panel’s mandate on the basis of that hearsay
    evidence; rather, he found it of little assistance in helping him determine the
    mindset of the Georgina Island consortium.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN’s second “hearsay” complaint is that the
    trial judge relied on the minutes of a December 14, 1994 Planning &amp;
    Priorities Committee (“PPC”) meeting to conclude that MFN Councillor Arnold
    Ingersoll had told the PPC that “a ‘draft’ profit-sharing formula had been
    developed, which would see 25% of the gross revenues and 60% of the net
    revenues distributed to the other First Nations.” The PPC (now called the
    Political Confederacy) is the lead policy development and implementation
    committee within the Chiefs of Ontario and is comprised of Grand Chiefs,
    Regional Chiefs and Elders. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The PPC minutes record Ingersoll as saying, “[a]
    draft profit-sharing formula has been developed – 25% off the top and 60% off
    the bottom for First Nations.  i.e., if
    the profit for one year is $300M, that would be about 33-35% or $100M to other
    First Nations.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN says Ingersoll’s evidence was that he did
    not believe he had used the word “draft,” and there was no evidence from anyone
    else that he had.  The minutes were
    hearsay which the trial judge should not have relied upon.  MFN cites this as another example where the
    trial judge ignored evidence in its favour and relied on hearsay to buttress
    his findings against it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, Ingersoll conceded in cross-examination
    that he could not remember whether he had used the word “draft” or not, and
    that the note taker at the meeting had been left with the impression he
    had.  Chief Peters, who was also at the
    meeting, testified that he understood the Ingersoll formula to be just one of
    the proposals that people were floating on the revenue sharing issue.  The trial judge’s conclusion that Ingersoll
    had used the word “draft” as recorded in the minutes was not just based on the minutes.  It was supported by Chief Peters’ testimony
    about the meeting, by Ingersoll’s own uncertainty, and by Ingersoll’s overall
    lack of credibility (the trial judge found “that his evidence relating to what
    happened left [him] more puzzled than not”).</p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thirdly, MFN argues that the trial judge
    improperly relied upon the contents of a letter dated October 31, 1995 from
    Dominic Alfieri, president of the Ontario Casino Commission, to Ted
    Williams.  The letter was part of an
    exchange that followed a meeting the previous week attended by Williams, Baker
    and Alfieri with a representative of the new casino operator.  At that meeting, Williams took the position
    asserted by MFN in this lawsuit, namely that MFN had a deal to receive 35% of
    the net revenues.  In a letter to Alfieri
    dated October 26, 1995, Williams reiterated the position, and he and Baker
    assembled and sent to Alfieri a package of materials designed to support MFN’s
    position.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alfieri’s responding letter of October 31, in
    turn, reiterated Ontario’s position that revenue sharing was a matter to be
    dealt with in post-site selection negotiations and that the host First Nation
    was not to receive a preferential share of gaming revenues.  He observed that the Ontario Casino Corporation
    had agreed to fund certain community facilities as part of the project based on
    “the principle that the host First Nation would not receive a direct share of
    the gaming revenues or any other revenues from activities that form an
    integrated part of the casino operations.”  Williams, <span class=SpellE>Craik</span> and Baker all denied this latter
    suggestion at <span class=GramE>trial,</span> and MFN argues that the trial
    judge erred in accepting Alfieri’s statement in the letter for the truth of its
    contents. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN’s criticism is, again, based on a
    misapprehension.  The October 31 letter
    formed part of the agreed documentation filed at trial, its authenticity
    admitted.  Williams received and read
    it.  The statements in the letter are not
    hearsay to the extent that they articulate the Ontario Casino Corporation’s
    position (and, therefore, Ontario’s).  They are therefore relevant and admissible – as the respondents argue –
    on the issue of MFN’s state of mind, and whether it had an objective or
    subjective belief, based on Ontario’s conduct, about its contractual
    rights.  On the issue of the truth of the
    statements themselves, the trial judge’s reference to the letter was part of
    his description of the narrative, and appears to have been of little moment in
    the end.  He ultimately dismissed the
    “paper war” between Williams and Alfieri on the basis that “Alfieri washed his
    hands of the debate and told MFN that it had to deal with [the Minister], as
    the matter was not within Alfieri’s bailiwick.”</p>

    Meeting, 1996</a></h5>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In late 1995, the Chiefs of Ontario established
    a Revenue Sharing Committee, chaired by Chief William McCue of the Georgina
    Island First Nation.  The McCue Committee
    met on January 29, 1996.  Chief McRae and
    Arnold Ingersoll attended for MFN and Ingersoll made a presentation concerning
    revenue sharing that contemplated a distribution on the basis that MFN would
    receive 35% of net revenues, the operator 5%, and the other First Nations
    60%.  MFN argues that the trial judge
    impermissibly relied upon a hearsay note in the draft minutes of that meeting
    indicating that Ingersoll had said that this split was “still to be negotiated”
    between MFN, the other First Nations and the operator.  In doing so, the trial judge noted, “[<span
class=SpellE>i</span>]n other words, he was never heard to affirm the position
    advanced in this lawsuit, namely that the sharing of the net revenue, if not
    the gross, had already been accomplished by the Global Proposal [MFN’s proposal
    submitted to the Selection Panel].” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two things may be said about this reference by
    the trial judge to the “still to be negotiated” remark.  First, the use to which he put the reference
    was accurate: Ingersoll is not recorded as having told the meeting that the
    revenue sharing of which he was speaking had already been accomplished or
    agreed to, nor did he say in his testimony that he had done so.  Secondly, while Ingersoll did testify in
    chief that he thought he said it was only the other First Nations’ portion of
    the split that remained open to negotiation, he acknowledged in
    cross-examination that he “[was] not clarifying the division as between [MFN]
    and the First Nations in this meeting”.  Hence, to the extent the “still to be negotiated” note was hearsay, the
    trial judge’s conclusion is nonetheless supported by inferences drawn from the
    testimony given by Ingersoll at trial.  </p>

    that the minutes of the AGS meetings were “of some assistance” but not
    “dispositive.”  The parties filed an
    Agreement as to Authenticity of Documents.  They agreed, in addition, that the documents referred to would be

    objective outcome of the negotiations, but we do not accept that he erred in
    that interpretation or in the effect he gave to them.  He clearly took the minutes into account, but
    measured them as well – as he said – against the other proof he had before him.
      Nor do we accept that his description of them
    as “discursive” or “non-linear”, or as “mere posturing” or “politicking”, was
    either inaccurate or indicative of a failure to understand the cultural context

    findings of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Lovelace</i> is a particularly glaring example of his failure to take into account
    uncontested facts, facts the parties had agreed to, and the respondents’
    admissions.  This, too, undermined his
    overall findings.  The passage that MFN
    alleges the trial judge particularly disregarded appears in <i>Lovelace</i>, at para. 26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[AGS] Meetings continued between Ontario and the
    band and, in 1993, this process resulted in the <i>mutually agreed upon site selection criteria</i> and the striking of an
    independent First Nations panel to review site proposals.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge observed that, while there was
    no dispute about the details of this passage when <i>Lovelace</i> was decided, eight years later that passage had become
    central to the dispute before him.  “I am
    asked now to consider whether there were in fact ‘mutually agreed upon site
    selection criteria’,” he went on to say, and “what those criteria were, and
    what they meant.”  MFN asserts, in
    effect, that the trial judge was bound by <i>Lovelace</i>,
    and was not entitled to re-open the selection criteria issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This position is not tenable for two reasons, at
    least.  First, the Supreme Court of
    Canada could not have expected that it was resolving the facts in a future case
    that was not before it.  As noted, the
    issue in <i>Lovelace</i> was whether
    non-status Indians and Métis would be entitled to share in the casino revenues,
    something quite different than the issues arising in this action.  Secondly, the issue here is not so much
    whether there was agreement on site selection criteria (everyone concedes there
    was), but rather the meaning of the “revenue sharing” component of those accepted
    criteria.</p>

    parties as to the basis upon which the trial was to proceed.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Our plan recognizes our own First Nation

    failure to include a specific revenue sharing formula in its February Proposal.  First, they said that Ontario’s commitment to
    remain revenue neutral had been given only four days prior to the deadline for
    submissions (at the February 24 AGS meeting) and Bally’s (which had primarily
    prepared the February Proposal) was not aware of it.  Secondly, the recent MFN election had
    resulted in three new members to the MFN Council who needed to be brought up to
    speed.  Thirdly, the bulk of the February
    Proposal had been prepared by Bally’s, with little input from MFN, and the
    Chief and Council had had very little time to review it prior to
    submission.  The fourth, and the appellant
    says “[m]<span class=SpellE>ost</span> important” reason provided by MFN’s
    witnesses, was that they expected (correctly, as it turned out) that the Selection
    Panel would not make a final decision solely on the basis of the written
    proposals, but rather would use a phased process, hold site visits, and request
    additional information.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the same time, however, Williams testified
    that MFN believed it was “putting its best foot forward” with its February
    Proposal. It was the reason they had submitted such a “complete package.”  MFN looked at its submission as being “a one-shot
    deal.”  MFN “stood or fell” on it. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not accept MFN’s
    explanations for the February Proposal’s silence about revenue sharing.   He did
    not ignore the evidence, but rather, he concluded that the reasons for the
    February Proposal being silent about revenue sharing “were never explained to
    [his] satisfaction.”  Indeed, he made
    specific reference to the oddity that MFN would fail to specify its revenue sharing
    proposal when there was no guarantee of a further meeting with the Selection
    Panel or any evidence that such a meeting was even contemplated at that time. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor did the trial judge misinterpret the

    context of the accompanying letters to the Selection Panel, <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span>,
    and Minister <span class=SpellE>Churley</span>.  He was well aware of the context.  Given, however, how pivotal the February Proposal and the Site Selection
    Process were to MFN’s position that the process constituted a tender or RFP and
    that the revenue sharing deal was to be struck with the Selection Panel, we
    find it inconceivable, as did the trial judge, that the February Proposal
    itself would not provide any details of the appellant’s “plan” for revenue
    sharing, and that its position would be left to vague references about a
    general willingness to share equitably in accompanying correspondence.  </p>

    60% of net revenues.  Bally’s, the
    proposed operator, was not chosen; instead, after an RFP process, MFN and Ontario
    selected CHC Casinos Canada Limited.   The yearly ground rent ($750,000 under the November Proposal) more than
    quadrupled after negotiation (to $3.5 million in the DOA).  In addition, MFN never built a Lake <span
class=SpellE>Couchiching</span> waterfront casino as proposed – the attractive
    waterfront destination resort concept that had influenced the Selection Panel
    in making its choice.  The casino was
    built away from the waterfront.  Finally,
    the November Proposal called for 50% of the casino’s employees to be drawn from
    First Nations.  Eight years later, only
    18% of employees were from First Nations. </p>

    Nations supported.  The reasons for the
    request, she said, were that MFN needed the money to provide financing for the
    remaining phases of the casino and needed the money to develop the casino to
    make it a destination resort.  This was
    consistent with the position MFN representatives had taken at the various
    Revenue Sharing Meetings following site selection and at the AOCCs, where an
    agreement was made to permit MFN to receive a 35% share for a five-year
    period.  </p>

    Court that there had been tripartite negotiations between Ontario, MFN and the
    Chiefs of Ontario about revenue sharing, and that “[b]y July 1996” a consensus
    was reached that MFN would receive 35% of net revenues from the casino and the
    other First Nations would receive 65%.  Again, the position is inconsistent with MFN’s argument that it was
    contractually entitled to 35% at the conclusion of the Site Section Process.</p>

    the position taken by MFN in <i>Lovelace</i>,
    reflected an agreement that emerged out of the 1996 and 1997 AOCCs.  Those meetings followed a lengthy period of
    negotiations between First Nations about revenue sharing in various other
    venues.  In none of these meetings or
    negotiations did MFN representatives assert that they had a fixed contractual
    right to 35% of the net revenues as a result of MFN having been chosen as host
    First Nation by the Selection Panel, based on the November Proposal (or on
    anything else).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For example, as previously noted in discussing
    the hearsay issue, at a December 19, 1994 PPC Meeting, Ingersoll – the then
    lead for MFN in communicating with other First Nations about revenue sharing – is
    noted as saying that “a <i>draft</i> profit-sharing formula has been developed – 25% off the top and 60% off the
    bottom for First Nations” (emphasis added).  There was no evidence that he said anything
    about a 35% cut of net revenues for MFN or of a revenue sharing contract
    already entered into with Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a May 1995 meeting of a committee headed by
    then Southeast Regional Chief of the UOI, Nora <span class=SpellE>Bothwell</span>-Sawyer, <span class=GramE>Ingersoll</span> advised that the amount to be shared among
    First Nations was “20% off the top” because that was what was in the RFP
    respecting the casino operator.  It
    appears that no one at that meeting was aware of the November Proposal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Meanwhile, in March 1995, MFN prepared a
    preliminary draft of a proposed tripartite Memorandum of Agreement with Ontario
    and the Ontario Casino Corporation designed to confirm the roles and
    responsibilities of the parties involved in the casino.  Article 3.4 of the draft proposed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The First Nation [MFN] <i>shall enter into a revenue/profit sharing agreement with all other
    First Nations in Ontario for an equitable sharing of the revenues/profits</i> of the lottery schemes conducted at the casino on the Reserve.  The revenue/profit sharing agreement <i>shall be negotiated between the First Nation
    and the other First Nations</i> without the intervention or participation of
    Ontario or the Corporation. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In March 1995, as well, MFN’s Director of
    Finance, Jeff <span class=SpellE>Craik</span>, prepared a draft RFP document
    for use in the process for selecting a commercial operator.  It stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <span class=SpellE>Chippewas</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Mnjikaning</span> were selected by the Province of Ontario as the
    site for the Aboriginal Casino Pilot Project.  One of the selection criteria was <i>a
    commitment to share the proceeds of the Casino with all of the First Nations of
    Ontario</i>.  All finalists in the
    selection process were required to submit a proposed Revenue Sharing Formula
    which indicated their willingness to share the profits of the casino operation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The Revenue
    Sharing Formula will be determined through a series of negotiations with the
    other First Nations in Ontario</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN argues that the trial judge wrongly
    interpreted these documents as being inconsistent with MFN’s claim.  To the contrary, it says, that is not “how
    [they were] prepared or understood on the evidence.”  The MFN witnesses testified that the wording
    in the documents related only to the sharing of revenues as between the other
    First Nations, not with MFN, and to whether the negotiations would involve
    Ontario or just the First Nations.  The
    trial judge therefore erred in drawing inferences against MFN’s position from
    the documentation, the argument goes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The documentation <i>could</i> support the interpretation sought to be put on them by the
    appellant, perhaps.  But it is not the
    only interpretation open on their wording, when considered in the context of
    other evidence and other documentation prepared on behalf of MFN and in
    circulation during this period.  There is
    an equally plausible, if not more plausible, interpretation – which the trial
    judge adopted, having considered the other evidence and documentation – namely,
    that the documents referred to a yet-to-be-held set of negotiations among First
    Nations that would determine the allocation of net revenues as between MFN and
    the other First Nations and as among all First Nations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This interpretation is buttressed, for example,
    by a briefing note prepared by <span class=SpellE>Craik</span> in June 1995, to
    be used by MFN’s Chief and Council in responding to questions from other First
    Nations.  In that note, MFN’s “official
    position” regarding revenue sharing was stated to be:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <span class=GramE>Chief &amp;</span> Council of
    The <span class=SpellE>Chippewas</span> of Rama First Nation are committed to
    providing the majority of profits from the Casino Operation to the other First
    Nations of Ontario.  At the present time, <i>the exact percentages to be allocated</i> and the mechanism to do so <i>have not been
    determined</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The
    allocation formula will be determined</i> through a series of negotiations
    between the Chippewas of Rama First Nation and the other 130 First Nations of
    Ontario. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This language is only consistent with an
    interpretation that the allocation formula – both as to MFN’s share and as to
    the share among the First Nations collectively – remained to be
    negotiated.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, at numerous MFN Council meetings held
    in 1995 and 1996, no reference was made to a contractual right to a 35% share
    of net revenues.  Instead, the focus
    appears to have been on a 20% of gross revenue figure (not 25%, as stated in
    the November Proposal) and on whether 5% of that should go to MFN with the
    remaining 15% to the other First Nations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In February 1996, Ingersoll sought approval from
    MFN’s Council to put forward two potential revenue sharing proposals at an
    upcoming meeting of the PPC two days later: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) 20%
    gross to other First Nations, 5% gross to MFN; or (ii) 16% gross to other First
    Nations, 4% gross to MFN.  Neither was
    consistent with the November Proposal.  While
    the February PPC meeting did not occur, Ingersoll’s preparatory notes for it
    are also inconsistent with the appellant’s position.  Ingersoll added a third option of his own: 20%
    of net revenues to go to the other First Nations and 75% to MFN.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The DOA was signed in March 1996.  As set out in our discussion of the facts, it
    defined the compensation MFN was to receive out of casino revenues.  Under the DOA, MFN’s “entire <span
class=GramE>compensation ..</span> <span class=GramE>for</span> services to be
    provided … in connection with the development and operation of the [casino
    complex]” was limited to the ground rent ($3.5 million annually, adjusted for
    inflation), the Rama Allocation ($4.5 million annually, adjusted for
    inflation), and the revenue from Specific Local Services.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The DOA was accompanied by a “Side Letter” which
    confirms this position.  The Side Letter
    was provided to cover off MFN’s position in another battle it was having with
    Ontario at the time over the newly-elected government’s decision to take a 20% win-tax
    on gross casino revenues for itself.  The
    Side Letter ensured that MFN’s execution of the DOA was without prejudice to
    its position in that other dispute.  Nonetheless, MFN acknowledged in the Side Letter that, pursuant to the
    terms of the DOA, it was only entitled to the Rama Allocation and any payments
    received pursuant to the ground lease and the Specific Local Services.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both Baker and <span class=SpellE>Craik</span> acknowledged that there was no explicit reference in any of the documentation
    they prepared to the fact that MFN already had a contractual claim to 35% of
    net revenues.  Indeed, Baker prepared a
    memorandum to the MFN Chief and Council outlining the features of the DOA which
    specifically stated, “[t]he agreement provides for Rama, in addition to ground
    rent, obtaining what is called the Rama fee.  <i>It is proposed in the agreement
    that this fee is in lieu of any participation in the net income</i>” (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not ignore the evidence of
    the MFN witnesses, or MFN’s position, on this point, as the appellant
    asserts.  He observed that “[w]<span
class=SpellE>hen</span> confronted with statements such as this,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></span></a> the MFN
    witnesses, including Williams, took the position that the negotiations
    anticipated in this and similar documents related only to the ‘distribution of
    revenues for all of the other First Nations and not <span class=SpellE>Mnjikaning</span>’.”  When the evidence and the documentation are
    considered in context, there is no basis for concluding that the trial judge
    drew inferences that were not open to him on the record or failed properly to
    assess the evidence.  He simply declined
    to accept the interpretation put forward by the appellant and its view of the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In June 1996, MFN went to the AOCC and requested
    the Chiefs’ approval of a 35%/65% split of net revenues.  The case was presented on the basis that MFN
    was at risk financially and that it had incurred massive debt in connection
    with the casino and needed the 35% to make sure it did not run into financial
    trouble.  MFN did not say it already had
    an agreement for the 35%.  As previously
    noted, a consensus ultimately developed at the meeting and a declaration was
    passed by the AOCC providing for a 35%/65% split.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Discussions continued in various forums
    thereafter respecting the duration of this distribution.  In none of them did MFN take the position it
    had a contractual entitlement to 35%.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issue was finalized at the 1997 AOCC.  In support of MFN’s need for the 35% over a
    five-year period, Chief McRae argued that MFN had incurred administrative
    costs, increased staffing needs, legal fees and debt responsibilities, and that
    MFN needed the funds to develop a destination resort.  She said nothing about a contractual
    entitlement to 35% of gross revenues.  The meeting ultimately reached a consensus in favour of a five-year period
    for the 35%/65% revenue allocation (i.e., 1996-2001), subject to review.  A declaration was issued to that effect.  At no time did MFN protest the Chiefs’ authority
    to determine its share of revenues.  It
    asked for and obtained the assistance of other First Nation negotiators in
    seeking Ontario’s approval of the five-year deal, which Ontario ultimately
    gave.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The significance of the many inconsistencies in
    MFN’s post-selection conduct and statements is twofold.  First, they are of some relevance and
    assistance in informing the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no contract
    as alleged by MFN, but rather an agreement that revenue sharing would be
    negotiated separately, after site selection.  Subsequent conduct may be of assistance in determining which of two
    reasonable interpretations should be accepted: <i>Canadian National Railways v. Canadian Pacific Ltd</i>., (1979), 95
    D.L.R. (3d) 242 (B.C.C.A), at p. 262, <span class=SpellE>aff’d</span> [1979] 2 S.C.R.
    668; <i>Montreal Trust Company Co. of Canada
    v. Birmingham Lodge Ltd</i>. (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), at p. 108.  MFN’s subsequent conduct is overwhelmingly
    consistent only with the trial judge’s interpretation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly, the inconsistent conduct is of
    considerable relevance in demonstrating MFN’s state of mind regarding the
    agreement that had been made and the objectivity of that belief. It buttressed
    the trial judge’s conclusion that MFN did not believe – objectively or
    subjectively – that the selection of the host First Nation secured for that
    First Nation whatever preferential share of casino net revenues it had included
    in its site proposal or put forward during the Site Selection Process – in
    MFN’s case, a contract for a 35% share of net revenues. We turn to this latter
    issue now. </p>

    fact, say 100 per cent revenue share to the First Nations during the AGS meetings”,
    but that was in the context of distinguishing between 100% of all revenues and
    100% of all gaming revenues.   </p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> also testified
    – and the trial judge accepted – that he repeatedly expressed at the AGS meetings
    Ontario’s position that: (a) there would be no special share of casino revenues
    for the host First Nation beyond the return on investment to be paid out of
    operating costs, and the potentially significant benefits arising from the
    non-gaming revenues, spinoff businesses and employment; (b) the casino profits
    were to be shared equitably among all First Nations, through a formula to be
    developed by First Nation representatives after site selection; and (c) the
    First Nations had the discretion to decide among themselves, when they
    eventually developed a revenue sharing formula, to give the host a preferential
    share of profits if they wished to do so. </p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On these

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That the First Nations were aware of Ontario’s
    expressed position is reflected in various minutes, and in various oral and
    written statements made by First Nations’ representatives.  For example, at the May 4, 1994 Sault Ste.
    Marie meeting, then Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> acknowledged Ontario’s position: “[R]<span class=SpellE>evenue</span> sharing,
    we already <span class=GramE>know</span> what that means, 100% in their eyes”.  In a letter to Chief Stinson, dated August
    10, 1994, Chief Glen Hare of the West Bay First Nation described “the
    provincial expectation of 100% net [r]<span class=SpellE>evenue</span> [s]haring.”  The written summary of an October 24, 1994
    meeting between <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span>, Minister <span class=SpellE>Churley</span>,
    and Grand Chief Joe Hare (who had replaced <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> as Grand Chief earlier that year) – while not expressing agreement on the
    issues – acknowledges the Ontario position:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The present
    sharing of revenues option presented by the province (100% revenues to all
    first nations)</i> will not work.  This
    issue will require further discussions and other options need to be designed to
    be distributed more fairly.  This will
    begin once the first Nation site has been chosen and the First Nation awarded
    the site is prepared to explore this item. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> As Ms.
    Block submits, therefore, regardless of whether the First Nations agreed with
    Ontario’s position on revenue sharing respecting the host, the Ontario position
    had been clearly and consistently conveyed to the First Nations throughout the
    negotiations, and was understood by the participants – including MFN – at the
    AGS meetings.  A reasonable First Nations
    person at that negotiating table would have understood that Ontario did not
    authorize the Selection Panel to determine the host First Nation’s share of
    casino revenues, as would a reasonable MFN representative.  There was ample evidence to support the trial
    judge’s acceptance of <span class=SpellE>Rabeau’s</span> evidence on this point
    and to support the findings made by the trial judge with respect to the
    objective and subjective beliefs of MFN in this regard.</p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN further contends that in making his findings
    with respect to a lack of objective or subjective belief, the trial judge
    ignored the evidence of four members of MFN’s leadership (Chief Stinson, Chief
    McRae, Williams, and Ingersoll) and two of <span class=GramE>its  key</span> advisors (Baker and <span
class=SpellE>Craik</span>) to the effect that they each understood that MFN had
    a binding entitlement to 35% of the net revenues based on the selection of
    their proposal.  In addition, the
    appellant says the trial judge ignored the evidence that other representatives
    of other First Nations held similar views.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We are not persuaded that the trial judge failed
    to consider this evidence.  The five
    specific reasons he gave for rejecting the subjective or mistaken belief
    argument demonstrate that he was alive to all of the evidence, including the
    testimony given by MFN witnesses.  He explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition, I am not persuaded that MFN subjectively held, or mistakenly believed
    in, the view that it is now propounding, for the following reasons:<a
name=fnr-113></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.&nbsp; If
    revenue sharing was to be fixed by proposal, why would the MFN submission be
    singularly silent on the issue, but for a mere expression of interest to meet
    and discuss the matter at a later date? This approach is particularly puzzling
    when one considers that there was no guarantee that a meeting with the Panel
    would be undertaken with any one proponent or was even contemplated at the time
    of the Submission Date.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.&nbsp; If  revenue sharing was to be negotiated
    with the Panel during the selection process, why would MFN not have prepared
    some form of strategic plan with input from Chief and Council, or else the
    consultants then on board, as a precursor to the either the July or November
    Visits with the Panel? Such lack of activity was more consistent with the Panel’s
    published and expressed mandate that it would decide on site selection only.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.&nbsp; If
    Ted Williams and Chief McRae believed that the Panel was engaged in some form
    of revenue-sharing negotiation during the November Visit, why was the
    number-crunching exercise undertaken in such a hurried fashion, without any
    involvement of Council, and with only minimal input from Chief McRae and the
    consultants, the latter of whom were not physically present to assist in the
    process?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.&nbsp; If
    the revenue-sharing aspect of the Global Proposal was so fundamental to MFN
    granting access to its ancestral lands for casino purposes, at the risk of
    seeming overly harsh, why was there a fundamental lack of understanding of
    constituent elements of the November Amendments on the part of the Chief and
    the members of Council from whom I heard?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.&nbsp; If
    the Global Proposal represented a contract, it was a contract that included not
    only 35% of net revenues for MFN, but also 25% of gross revenues and 60% of net
    revenues for other First Nations, as MFN conceded before me. If MFN
    subjectively believed that the Global Proposal was a binding contract, then why
    did it take MFN until the later stages of this trial, more than a decade after
    the contract was purportedly formed, to begin to fulfill its obligation to distribute
    the balance after the win-tax, namely 5% of the gross revenue from Casino Rama
    to other First Nations?  [Footnotes

    findings of MFN’s lack of objective or subjective belief.  While the reasons for the findings were cast
    in a rhetorical format, they cannot be dismissed as “speculation” or the
    application of “hindsight” or “circular” reasoning, as the appellant seeks to
    do.  </p>

    judge’s finding.  Ontario had persistently
    maintained, and repeatedly expressed – through <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> and Minister <span class=SpellE>Churley</span> and others – its position that
    100% of the net revenues would go to all First Nations.  No document specified that revenue sharing
    would be determined as a result of the Site Selection Process.  Indeed, as outlined above, many indicated to
    the contrary.  The <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria attached to the Policy Objectives (Exhibit 45) expressly state that
    revenue sharing was to be the subject of ongoing negotiations.  The conduct and statements of MFN
    representatives following site selection, as well as the documentation they

    trial, was tantamount to a tender process with certain features of an RFP
    process.  Practically speaking, MFN conflated
    the two concepts. By selecting MFN as the host site, the theory went, the Selection
    Panel – on behalf of Ontario – accepted MFN’s 35% revenue-splitting tender or
    offer as set out in the November Proposal, thereby creating a binding contract
    to that effect.  As counsel put it at
    para. 239 of MFN’s factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The basic question to be answered was: would the
    words and conduct of the Province and the Panel lead a reasonable First Nation
    proponent to believe that the share of the profits they would receive if
    selected to host a provincial casino on their reserve would be finalized, as a
    contractual right, by the final decision in the Selection Process?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded – correctly, in our
    view – that the Site Selection Process did not fall within the legal paradigm
    of a tender contract.  As he noted, MFN’s
    position regarding its contractual argument was “something of a moving target”,
    changing as the trial progressed to one that treated the notion of “tender”
    interchangeably with the notion that the Site Selection Process was akin to a RFP.  In the end, the trial judge determined  “that the AGS meetings, viewed objectively,
    [did not lead] to an agreement between First Nations and the Province that the
    proposed process gave rise to either a tender or formal request for proposal,
    although it had some aspects of the latter”.  We agree.</p>

    of the law of tendering, suffice it to say that it is built around the
    “Contract A/Contract B”<span lang=EN-US> analysis articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Ontario v. Ron Engineering</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111, as revised in <i>M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v. <span
class=SpellE>Defence</span> Construction (1951) Ltd.</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 619.   The submission of a bid, or “tender,” in
    response to an invitation to tender, may result in initial contractual
    obligations (Contract A), if the parties intend this to be the case.  The terms of Contract <span class=GramE>A</span> are governed by the terms of the tender call but generally include the
    obligation to enter into a second contract (Contract B), upon acceptance of a
    compliant bid, in the terms of that bid.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, as the trial judge observed, there is
    nothing in the Site Selection Process that falls easily into that legal
    paradigm.  Ontario arguably issued an
    “invitation to tender” by asking interested First Nations to make a proposal
    for selection as the site for the single First Nation casino.  But there is no document coming from MFN that
    fits comfortably into the concept of a “tender” (Contract A) which, if accepted
    by Ontario (or the Selection Panel on behalf of Ontario), could be transformed into
    a performance contract (Contract B) containing the terms of the tender, as
    required in tender law.  </p>

    characteristics of a tender or proposal document.  It was presented by MFN.  It contained a revenue sharing proposal.  Even at that, however, the revenue sharing
    “proposal” was tempered by the suggestion that MFN was “open to increasing
    other First Nations share”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, the revenue sharing proposal created problems
    for MFN if it were to be accepted as a tender or proposal document.  First, the circumstances in which the
    November Proposal was prepared – found by the trial judge and accurately
    described by the Chiefs in their factum as “MFN’s hurried number crunching exercise
    during the site visit on November 18, 1994, without the involvement of MFN
    Council and with minimal input from Chief McRae and MFN’s consultants” – do not
    lend themselves to the conclusion that the November Proposal was considered by
    MFN to be a tender or a response to an RFP, as opposed to something put
    together in a hurry for purposes of negotiation.  <span class=SpellE>Altin</span> Paulson’s
    testimony, accepted by the trial judge, was that the Selection Panel’s November
    18 site visit was not a revenue sharing discussion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly – and more importantly – MFN did not
    consider itself bound by any provision in the revenue sharing formula other
    than the proviso that it <span class=GramE>receive</span> a 35% preferential
    share of net revenues.  Recall that the
    formula in the November Proposal provided not only for MFN to receive 35% of
    net revenues, but also for “other First Nations” to receive 25% of gross
    revenues along with 60% of net revenues, and for the operator to receive 2.75%
    of gross revenues and 5% of net revenues.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, MFN was to receive set payments of
    $3 million per year for municipal services and $750,000 for ground rent.  None of these measures were ever given effect.  The 25% of gross revenues for other First
    Nations became 20% in the following negotiations and remained that way until
    the issue was pressed at the end of trial and MFN agreed to pay the additional
    5%.  MFN negotiated a ground rent of more
    than the above amount ($3.5 million) plus the Rama Allocation of $4.5 million
    per year in addition to an unrestricted amount in payments for municipal and
    other local services.  </p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An RFP process differs from a tender process.  As noted above, the Contract A/Contract B
    analysis may not always be triggered.  It
    depends upon whether the parties intend to initiate contractual relations by
    the submission of a bid in response to the invitation to tender: <i>M.J.B. Enterprises</i>, at para. 23.  In some cases, depending upon the wording of
    the request for proposals, the successful proponent may acquire a contract with
    the party calling for tenders on some matters, and the right to negotiate with
    the owner on others.  In other cases, the
    only effect of being selected as winning bidder is to position the bidder as a
    negotiating party, with the content of the winning proposal serving simply to
    outline the bidder’s opening negotiating position  Authors Paul <span class=SpellE>Sandori</span> and William M. <span class=SpellE>Pigott</span> explain these principles as
    follows in <i>Bidding and Tendering: What is
    the Law?</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 2000), at p. 239:</p>

    expressions of interest and sets out the owner’s intention to consider those
    expressions of interest and then to undertake <i>negotiations</i> with one or more parties whose proposal(s) appeal to
    the owner.</p>

    something akin to an RFP, as the trial judge noted.  Ontario called for proposals respecting the
    selection of a host site.  Site selection
    criteria (the <span class=SpellE>Rabeau</span> Criteria) were established
    during the AGS meetings and provided the framework for the presentation of such
    proposals.  Taking the November Proposal
    as MFN’s pitch in the context of revenue sharing, the parameters of a
    negotiation are in place.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And that is precisely what happened.  Negotiations continued throughout 1995, 1996
    and 1997, following MFN’s selection as host First Nation in December 1994 –
    particularly through the Revenue Sharing Meetings and the AOCCs described
    earlier in these Reasons.  Throughout these
    negotiations, the First Nations attempted to reach a consensus on revenue sharing
    between the First Nations as a collective and between MFN, as host, and the
    other First Nations as a collective.  This
    process – strained and interrupted as it was by the Government’s change in
    position in imposing the 20% win-tax – ultimately resulted in the agreement
    that MFN would be entitled to a 35% share of net revenues for a period of five
    years.  Having achieved a consensus, the

    trial judge that it did not constitute a process whereby there was to be a
    binding agreement on revenue sharing, negotiated with the Selection Panel, and
    settled once the Selection Panel had chosen the host First Nation.  The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At best, the evidence supports the proposition that
    the proposals had to address each of the agreed upon criteria, which included

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the trial judge’s findings, MFN
    argues that Ontario’s breach of fiduciary duty is an independent and
    alternative basis for its claim.  The
    fiduciary duty is said to arise (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) from the <i>sui generis</i> duties owed by the Crown to
    Aboriginals in any dealings for the use of reserve land, and (ii) because MFN
    and Ontario were engaged in a “partnered initiative” or joint venture and,
    therefore, as partners or participants in a joint business venture, owed each
    other fiduciary duties during their negotiations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We reject these arguments for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the appellant’s <i>sui generis</i> argument is primarily based on the application of <i>Guerin v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
    335.  <i>Guerin</i>,
    however, is distinguishable on the facts. There, a First Nation agreed to
    surrender a portion of its reserve lands for purposes of a lease to be granted
    to a Vancouver golf club.  The Crown
    represented that the lease would contain certain terms and the First Nation
    agreed to the surrender on the basis of those terms.  However, when the lease was executed it
    contained terms that were considerably less favourable to the First Nation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    Supreme Court of Canada found that the Crown owed a <i>sui generis</i> fiduciary duty to Indians in relation to the surrender
    of their lands and concluded that the Crown had breached its duty by ignoring
    the oral terms which the Band understood would be embodied in the lease.  The Crown’s oral misrepresentations formed
    the backdrop against which the Crown’s discharge of its fiduciary obligation
    must be measured.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, this
    case is not analogous.  It does not
    involve the surrender of lands <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Crown in right of Ontario.  More
    importantly – and this is the Achilles heel of the appellant’s argument on this
    point – the trial judge found that MFN’s representatives did not have an
    understanding (objectively <i>or</i> subjectively) that was contrary to what Ontario was saying and doing or from
    what ultimately happened.  There were therefore
    no Crown misrepresentations to form the backdrop against which the Crown’s
    discharge of its duties was to be measured.  That being the case, the fiduciary argument, based on the <i>Guerin</i> approach, fails. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, while it is unnecessary to decide
    the point in this case, there is some authority to suggest it is the federal
    Crown, as opposed to the Crown in the right of a province, that owes the <i>sui generis</i> fiduciary duty to
    Aboriginals based on the special historical relationship that exists between
    the federal Crown and Aboriginal people and the constitutional capacity to look
    after the best interests of Aboriginal people.  </p>

    34, this Court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am doubtful whether the provincial Crown owes
    fiduciary duties to aboriginal people that, on breach, would allow for the
    transfer of land.  The fiduciary duty of
    the Crown to aboriginal people is fundamentally a duty of the federal
    Crown.  It is the federal government that
    has legislative responsibility for Indians and lands reserved for Indians under <i>s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867</i>.  <span class=GramE>As the Supreme Court said in <i>Mitchell

    MFN and Ontario were engaged in some sort of “partnered initiative,” or joint
    venture, in the selection, development and operation of the casino.  MFN’s submission in this regard takes its life
    from the Supreme Court of Canada’s comment in<i> Lovelace</i> about a “partnered initiative” in relation to the
    casino.  In <i>Lovelace</i>, however, the Court was not dealing with fiduciary duties,
    nor was it dealing with the specific relationship between Ontario and MFN.  The “partnered initiative” description was
    used in connection with the relationship between Ontario and Ontario First
    Nations collectively, and was made for the purpose of distinguishing the casino
    project, as a partnered ameliorative program, from other projects that could be
    described as universal or generally comprehensive benefits programs: <i>Lovelace</i>, at para. 82.  We do not read <i>Lovelace</i> as making a binding declaration of partnership that would
    govern the facts of a relationship not before it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[208]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the trial judge’s findings, there is
    nothing in the record that would support the existence of a partnership or a
    joint venture between MFN and Ontario in relation to the casino project.  There is no agreement to that effect.  Nobody treated – or spoke of – the
    relationship in those terms.  Nothing
    suggests that Ontario pledged itself to act in the best interests of MFN, to
    the exclusion of the interests of the other 133 First Nations, much less to the
    exclusion of its own interests.  </p>

    fiduciary relationships, what is required to establish a fiduciary relationship
    “is evidence of a mutual understanding that one party has relinquished its own
    self-interest and agreed to act solely on behalf of the other party.” He also
    noted at p. 414 that “[c]<span class=SpellE>ommercial</span> interactions
    between parties at arm’s length normally derive their social utility from the
    pursuit of self-interest, and the courts are rightly circumspect when asked to
    enforce a duty (i.e., the fiduciary duty) that vindicates the very anti-thesis
    of self-interest”. </p>

    duty owed to all Ontario First Nations collectively, and not just to MFN
    alone.  Any preferential treatment of
    MFN, to the detriment of the other First Nations, would have placed Ontario in
    breach of its broader fiduciary obligation to the others.  </p>

    asserts that the fiduciary duty plays an additional role in these
    circumstances.  It says the fiduciary
    duty sets the legal standard by which the Province’s words and actions during
    the negotiations are to be assessed and that the trial judge’s failure to
    recognize this undermined his fact-finding exercise.  The honour of the Crown is at stake in all
    dealings with Aboriginal peoples, MFN contends, and this notion “is not mere
    incantation, but rather a core precept that finds its application in concrete
    practices”:  <span class=SpellE><i>Haida</i></span><i> Nation v. British Columbia (Minster of Forests)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R.

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[213]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are several reasons these arguments cannot
    prevail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[214]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, <span class=GramE>neither the existence or</span> non-existence of a fiduciary duty nor the Aboriginal nature of these
    proceedings has any bearing on whether there were or were not ambiguities in
    the words or conduct of the Crown’s representatives during the AGS meetings or
    the Site Selection Process.  The trial
    judge found there were none.  He held
    that the Crown’s position – as articulated by Ontario’s various representatives
    – was consistent, and clear, throughout: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) there
    would be only one commercial Aboriginal casino; (ii) the net gaming revenues
    from the operation of that casino would be shared equitably among all First
    Nations; (iv) the host First Nation would be compensated out of operating costs
    (with additional compensation from ground rent, municipal services, and
    spin-off benefits like employment); and (v) revenue sharing would be determined
    by the First Nations in negotiations at a more broadly representative
    negotiation table following site selection.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[215]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly, the trial judge was alive to MFN’s
    argument that contracts are to be given a broad and liberal interpretation and,
    if necessary, any ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the Aboriginal
    litigant.  He referred to it specifically
    at the outset of his reasons and was acutely aware that he was dealing with an
    Aboriginal case involving Aboriginal witnesses whose cultural background
    differed from his own.  He took care to
    ensure he understood the witnesses’ evidence.  His treatment of former Chief McRae during her testimony – although
    subject to criticism by the appellant – in fact demonstrated his sensibility to
    the cultural and other interests underlying the proceedings. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[216]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN does not say clearly how the trial judge
    should have permitted the fiduciary duty to inform his perspective of the
    evidence-weighing process.  But, in any
    event, we do not accept that he interpreted the words and conduct of the Crown
    representatives “in a narrow technical manner that [favoured] the Crown’s
    interests”, as the appellant contends.  Nor did he make credibility findings against MFN witnesses because he was
    insensitive to First Nations and their culture, or oblivious to the notion of
    fiduciary obligations.  He did not accept
    their evidence because he preferred the evidence of the other First Nation
    witnesses and of the other witnesses called by the respondents.  As we have noted on several occasions, these
    findings were amply supported on the record.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[217]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It must be remembered that the evidence of the
    MFN witnesses was disputed at many levels by other Aboriginal witnesses – <span
class=SpellE>Atlin</span> Paulson and former Grand Chiefs <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> and Peters, in particular.  The trial
    judge measured the Crown’s words and conduct against all of this evidence in
    arriving at his conclusions, as he was bound to do. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[218]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, the argument that the trial judge
    failed to consider the manner in which a First Nations person would understand
    Ontario’s words and conduct ignores the substantial evidence – referred to
    earlier in these Reasons – that the First Nations, including MFN, understood
    exactly what Ontario was saying.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[219]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN’s thesis is tantamount to suggesting that
    the trial judge was required to apply some different manner of scrutiny to the
    two sets of Aboriginal witnesses because of an alleged fiduciary duty which, if
    anything, was owed to the all of them.  To make the statement is to refute it.  Nor should we lose sight of the fact that, while the formal <span
class=SpellE><i>lis</i></span> here is
    between MFN and Ontario, the dispute is nonetheless <i>only</i> about the sharing of casino revenues among First Nations. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

'>[220]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MFN’s argument in this respect is essentially an
    attempt to persuade the court that because the Supreme Court of Canada has
    underscored the importance of the <i>sui
    generis</i> fiduciary obligation owed by the federal Crown to First Nations
    with respect to dealings involving First Nations’ lands – and has stated that “<i>treaties and statutes</i> relating to
    Indians should be liberally construed and doubtful expressions resolved in
    favour of the Indians” (<span class=SpellE><i>Nowegijick</i></span>,
    at p. 36) – the trial judge must resolve <i>conflicting
    testimony</i> about the words and conduct of parties in favour of Aboriginals
    on the same basis.  We do not read the <span
class=SpellE><i>Nowegijick</i></span> and <i>Guerin</i> line of cases as standing for
    such a proposition.  A trial judge must
    weigh and assess conflicting evidence in the same way as he or she always does
    – dispassionately, against the record as a whole, and with due consideration
    for any particular sensibilities (cultural or otherwise) that may impact upon a
    witness’s testimony.  The trial judge did
    just that.</p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[222]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The root of this complaint lies in a number of
    the trial judge’s comments that MFN takes to have revealed insensitivity to the
    sovereignty and autonomy of First Nations, which is recognized in the 1991
    Statement of Political Relationship, signed by the Province and Ontario’s First
    Nations, acknowledging their inherent right of self-government. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[223]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For example, he commented on the reality of the
    Province’s imposition of the 20% win-tax.  MFN points out that there remains an outstanding constitutional
    challenge on this “nation-to-nation” issue. The trial judge observed that provincial
    oversight of the revenue sharing negotiation process “struck [him] as something
    of a mandatory political construct”.  This was “patronizing” and suggested First Nations were incapable of
    making decisions on their own, MFN says.  The trial judge attributed to the First Nations’ own extra-legal
    political and co-ordinating bodies – e.g., the COO, UOI, PTOs, and AOCC – what
    amounts to a veto over the individual First Nation’s autonomy, and remarked
    that he could not “imagine that this multiple-stage [PTO and AOCC] process
    would not be followed” for revenue sharing.  These observations are said to suggest that a First Nation does not have
    the autonomy to enter into an agreement with the Province on its own. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[224]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, there was never any issue at trial –
    and the trial judge made no such suggestion in his reasons – that MFN did not
    have the authority to deal with, and contract with, Ontario with respect to the
    development and operation of the casino on its own.  Nor was it disputed at trial that Ontario
    insisted on being involved in the revenue sharing negotiations following site
    selection, although not in the First Nations’ decisions about how the revenue
    was to be allocated.   In making these
    comments, it seems to us, the trial judge was merely acknowledging the evidence
    he had heard from Regional Chief Peters and Grand Chief <span class=SpellE>Miskokomon</span> that issues such as revenue sharing, which affected all First Nations in the
    Province, were matters that had to be decided by the First Nations collectively,
    after proper consultation and consideration.  That was the political reality.  At
    no time did he ever suggest that MFN’s sovereignty or autonomy as a First
    Nation was in any way limited by other First Nations, or by Ontario.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[40]  Whatever may have been the case in the past,
    it is no longer possible to view the trial judge as little more than a referee
    who must sit passively while counsel call the case in any fashion they
    please.  Until relatively recently a long
    trial lasted for one week, possibly two.  Now, it is not unusual for trials to last for many months, if not
    years.  Early in the trial or in the
    course of a trial, counsel may make decisions that unduly lengthen the trial or
    lead to a proceeding that is almost unmanageable.  It would undermine the administration of
    justice if a trial judge had no power to intervene at an appropriate time and,
    like this trial judge, after hearing submissions, make directions necessary to
    ensure that the trial proceeds in an orderly manner.  I do not see this power as a limited one
    resting solely on the court’s power to intervene to prevent an abuse of its
    process.  Rather, the power is founded on

lang=EN-US>When a trial judge has questions for
    a witness being examined by counsel, it is generally best to leave the
    questions to a point during the evidence where counsel has completed a
    particular area or to the end of the witness’s evidence.  In that way, the judge avoids interfering with
    the organization and flow of the evidence.  Excessive judicial intervention in the examination of a witness, whether
    in-chief or on cross-examination, may hamper counsel from following a well
    thought-out and organized line of inquiry.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>71.  Advocates are entitled to expect judges to treat everyone before the
    courts with appropriate courtesy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>74.  Advocates are entitled to expect that judges will not engage in

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>All of that said<span class=GramE>,</span> appellate courts are reluctant to intervene on the basis that a trial judge
    “entered the arena” and improperly intervened in a trial.  There is a strong presumption that judges have
    conducted themselves fairly and impartially.  Isolated expressions of impatience or annoyance by a trial judge as a
    result of frustrations, particularly with counsel, do not of themselves create
    unfairness:  see <i>Kelly v. Palazzo</i> (2008), 89 O.R. (3d) 111 (C.A.), at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. </span><span lang=FR-CA>20-21; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Kitaitchik</span></i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 14 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. </span><span lang=EN-US>12-14; and <span class=SpellE><i>Confectionately</i></span><i> Yours, Inc. (Re)</i> (2000), 219 D.L.R. (4th)
    72 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 28.  Similarly,
    a trial judge’s willingness to debate with counsel openly over relevant factual
    and legal issues should not serve as a basis for a reasonable apprehension of
    bias.  In the end, an appellate court
    should only intervene if satisfied that the trial judge’s interventions,
    considered in the context of the entire trial, created a reasonable
    apprehension that the trial judge was biased.</span></p>

    start.  MFN’s first witness was examined in-chief
    for nine days.  The trial judge
    intervened on many occasions.  By and
    large, his interventions were directed at focusing the evidence on the issues
    and clarifying matters that were difficult to follow.  He became impatient with the pace of the trial
    occasionally and also with what he viewed to be attempts to introduce
    irrelevant or unnecessary documents.  His
    comments, however, were directed at MFN’s counsel, not at the witness.  </span></p>

    raised on this appeal, the core of this case turned on whether MFN was able to
    establish that there was an agreement that it would receive 35% of the net

    of some of MFN’s evidence and, in some instances, with MFN’s theory of its

    the interventions on the entire proceeding.  We have done that.  We are
    satisfied that to a large extent, the trial judge’s interventions in this case
    were properly directed at managing the trial and controlling the process.  As it was, even with the trial judge’s

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, it is worth noting that
    throughout the trial, experienced counsel who acted for MFN did not object that
    the trial judge was being too interventionist.  On the contrary, counsel invited the trial judge to intervene and ask
    questions as he saw fit.  While the
    failure of a party to object to what it later alleges were undue interventions
    is not fatal to succeeding on such an argument, it is certainly relevant.  Here, over the course of a 47-day trial, one
    might reasonably expect that counsel for MFN would have raised some objection
    if the trial judge’s interventions were creating the perception of unfairness
    that it now alleges.  Objections of this
    sort can be made in a measured and respectful way and need not result in
    confrontation between counsel and a trial judge.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Secondly, in assessing the impact of
    the trial judge’s interventions, it is also important to bear in mind that
    throughout he demonstrated sensitivity to, and was solicitous of, the
    witnesses.  The trial judge explained the
    nature of the process to many of the witnesses and showed patience with the
    witnesses when there was confusion or when additional time was required to lead
    the evidence.  As an example, he
    permitted one of MFN’s witnesses to speak with her counsel during
    cross-examination to better enable the witness to understand the line of
    questioning.  As mentioned above, the
    complaints raised on this appeal with respect to improper interventions are
    largely directed at interventions or comments made to MFN’s counsel and not to
    the witnesses. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Finally, we do not accept MFN’s argument
    that the trial judge improperly commented on what evidence he expected the
    respondents to lead in answer to MFN’s evidence, thereby assisting the
    respondents and diminishing the evidence of MFN’s witnesses.  In our view, in making the impugned comments,
    the trial judge did nothing more than attempt to help the parties focus their
    positions, narrow the issues and identify the areas in which he saw the
    differences in their positions.  The
    parties at trial were represented by senior and experienced counsel.  Undoubtedly, they knew their cases well and
    were able to form their own judgments as to what evidence needed to be
    called.  We see nothing improper in these
    remarks.</span></p>

    he <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> respondents’ counsel over the appellant’s
    or the respondents’ case over the appellant’s.  However, we are not satisfied that when those comments are viewed in the

    important purposes.  They allow the

    time of trial, the proper name of the plaintiff/appellant was the Chippewas of
    Mnjikaning First Nation, and it was referred to at trial as “Mnjikaning” or
    “MFN”.  Its name was subsequently changed
    to the Chippewas of Rama First Nation, the name it held from 1993 to 1996, when
    the events leading up to the establishment of the casino took place.  We shall refer to the appellant as “MFN” or,
