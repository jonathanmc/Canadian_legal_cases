  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent claimed damages for breach of an Exclusive
    Selling Agreement (the “Agreement”) whereby the appellant had given the
    respondent the exclusive right to negotiate the sale of the appellant’s
    business.  The respondent procured a
    Letter of Intent from a prospective purchaser but the appellant, as was its
    right, did not agree to the proposed terms.  Thirteen days prior to the expiry of the period prescribed in the Agreement,
    the appellant decided it did not wish to sell the business and withdrew it from
    sale.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provisions in the Agreement that must be considered
    are Articles 3 and 4 [“CLIENT” is the appellant vendor and “CONSULTANT” is the
    respondent agent]:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. CLIENT irrevocably instructs closing lawyer to
    pay commissions at closing as directed by CONSULTANT prior to disbursing funds
    to CLIENT.  <i>Client agrees to pay CONSULTANT and CONSULTANT agrees to accept a
    percentage of the final selling price (the “Transaction Fee”) in accordance
    with the following schedule</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>10 % on the first
    $2 million; plus 5.0% on the next $1 million; plus 3% on the remaining balance</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.   <i>In the event the transaction contemplated
    herein does not close, the CONSULTANT is entitled to the Transaction Fee in the
    following circumstances</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the Sole and Exclusive Period or any
    extension thereof CLIENT sells, leases, trades or otherwise disposes of all or
    any part of the Business or its capital shares of a corporation regardless of
    whether or not the CONSULTANT was involved in or responsible for such
    disposition, or CLIENT enters into a contract of sale independent of
    CONSULTANTS’S assistance, accepts a deposit, or records a notice of intention
    to sell or advertise the Business for sale independently of the CONSULTANT’S
    action, <i>or CLIENT withdraws the Business
    from sale, or purports to terminate this Agreement</i>, or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CLIENT fails or refuses to complete a sale,
    lease, trade, or other disposition of all or any part of the Business after
    entering into a written agreement to do so, or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to two (2) years following the Sole and
    Exclusive Period, CLIENT, sells leases trade or otherwise disposes of all or
    any part of the Business (or any other business owned by CLIENT) to any person,
    firm, or entity referred to the Business by CONSULTANT or who became aware of
    the Business through the efforts of CONSULTANT during the Sole and Exclusive
    Period, or employs merges with or otherwise forms a relationship with any
    person, firm or entity referred to the Business by CONSULTANT, or who became
    aware of the Business through the efforts of CONSULTANT, or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CLIENT wilfully misrepresents facts, financial
    information or supporting documentation related to the Business, which
    adversely affects the ability to cause a disposition of the Business. [Emphasis
    added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent made no claim for compensation on a quantum
    merit basis. The trial judge awarded damages for breach of contract, based upon
    the percentage formula for a “Transaction Fee” prescribed by Article 3, as
    applied to the proposed purchase price in the Letter of Intent that the
    appellant had rejected.  That amount was
    modestly discounted to arrive at a total of $350,000, an amount that the
    respondent had said it was prepared to accept.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the respondent’s only entitlement to
    compensation under the Agreement is limited by the terms providing for the
    payment of a “Transaction Fee”. Read as a whole, the Agreement limits that
    entitlement to circumstances where there is a “transaction”, that is, an
    accepted agreement of purchase and sale that provides for a “final selling
    price”, against which the fee can be measured.  Such an agreement is the “transaction contemplated” upon which the
    payment of a fee under Article 4 is premised.  We agree with the appellant that as there was no such agreement or “transaction”,
    there is no compensation payable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, there can be no right to any payment under
    Article 4, bullet point 1, based upon the appellant’s withdrawal of the
    business from sale, unless the provision governing the consultant’s entitlement
    to the fee in the opening words of Article 4 has been satisfied.  As that essential condition was not satisfied,
    there is no fee owing and no damages were suffered by the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we note that the respondent proved no damages
    apart from the claim based upon the transaction fee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment is set
    aside and the action is dismissed.  Costs
    to the appellant for both the trial and the appeal fixed at $40,000, inclusive
    of GST and disbursements.</p>
