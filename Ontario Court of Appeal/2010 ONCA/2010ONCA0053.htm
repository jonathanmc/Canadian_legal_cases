  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the aunt of the children who are the subject of the
    custody trial in this matter. She sought leave at the settlement conference in
    March 2009 to be added as a party to the proceeding in order to seek custody of
    the children. Justice Trotter allowed her 30 days peremptory to file the
    necessary material to be added as a party as the trial was set for June, 2009.
    The appellant did not file the necessary material within the 30 days, and
    sought leave from Greer J. for an extension of time, due to delays caused in
    part by legal aid delays retaining new counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Greer considered the reasons offered for the appellant’s failure
    to comply with the 30 day time limit, but concluded that she would not grant an
    extension of time as the trial had been set for June 15 for 6 days and it was
    important for the trial to proceed. The children ages 7 and 12 had lost their
    parents in a car accident in 2008. Their maternal grandparents wanted to obtain
    custody and parent the children. A report prepared by the officer of the Children’s
    Lawyer recommended that it was in the best interests of the children to be
    placed in the care and custody of their grandparents rather than with the
    appellant or either of her two sisters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view there is no basis to set aside the decision of Greer J. to
    deny the appellant extra time to participate. She had been involved formerly
    and informally in the proceedings for many months prior to the settlement
    conference but had not taken the steps required to become a party. In fact, she
    had been a party originally, but had removed herself at one point. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Greer effectively determined that in the circumstances it was
    most important that the custody issue be resolved so that the children’s
    stability could be insured as soon as possible. What occurred eventually was a
    consent order awarding custody to the grandparents. There is no evidence that
    the result is not in the best interests of the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity bases in the amount of $3,726
    plus G.S.T. </p>
