  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On a hot August night in 2002, a dispute arose
    between two groups of young men over the theft of a young man’s gold
    chain.  In the resulting clash between
    the two groups, one young man was stabbed twice in the chest by the appellant.  He died shortly thereafter.  The appellant was tried on a charge of second
    degree murder before Justice Faye McWatt and a jury.  The appellant raised the defence of
    self-defence.  The appellant was found
    guilty as charged on April 30, 2004.  On
    June 30, 2004, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with parole ineligibility
    of 12 years.  He now appeals his
    conviction on a number of grounds.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I would allow the appeal and order a new
    trial, I will restrict my review of the evidence to that which is necessary to dispose
    of the issues in the appeal.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 13, 2002, Azmal Hossain, Haines Jones
    and two young women went to Dentonia Park in Scarborough where they met with a
    group of Jones’s friends.  They next went
    to a liquor store and then to a nearby apartment complex at Teesdale Place
    where the two young women lived.  Jones
    left briefly to speak to someone he knew.  As Hossain waited for Jones to return, he was approached by the
    appellant and another young man.  The
    appellant asked Hossain what he was doing.  Hossain replied that he was waiting for someone.  Hossain was told to “get out of here”.  When the two young men returned to find that
    Hossain was still there, the appellant tore a gold chain from Hossain’s
    neck.  Hossain returned to Dentonia Park
    and sought help from Muhunthan Kulasingham (the “deceased”) and a number of Jones’s
    other friends to help him retrieve his gold chain.  The deceased and his friends often frequented
    Dentonia Park to drink and socialize.  They formed a group and headed for the apartment complex in Teesdale
    Place in search of the gold chain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was dusk when Hossain and the deceased,
    backed up by the rest of the group, <span class=GramE>proceeded</span> up the
    driveway at 40 Teesdale Place towards the adjacent basketball court.  There, the deceased confronted the
    appellant.  The eyewitness accounts at
    trial as to what happened next varied widely.  No purpose would be served by summarizing each of these accounts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was evidence that the appellant was part
    of another group of young men who supported him when he faced off against the
    group led by the deceased and Hossain.  Some of them were said to have thrown beer bottles from the roof of the
    parking garage at the top of the driveway.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant testified.  He acknowledged that he had stolen the gold
    chain from Hossain.  He said that the
    deceased’s group had approached him.  Hossain
    stated that he didn’t want any problems.  The appellant replied that it didn’t look like they had come to talk and
    reached for a beer bottle in the deceased’s pocket.  When the appellant grabbed the bottle, the
    deceased slapped the appellant’s hand.  The bottle fell from the deceased’s pocket and broke on the ground.  The deceased then shoved the appellant
    backward and threw the bottle that he was drinking from at the appellant,
    striking him in the ribs.  According to
    the appellant, the deceased then pulled out another bottle from his pocket and,
    with the bottle <span class=GramE>raised</span>, charged at the appellant.  The appellant testified that he believed that
    the deceased intended to strike him over the head with the beer bottle.  As the deceased moved forward, the appellant
    pulled his knife from his back pocket, opened the blade, ducked and stabbed the
    deceased in the side.  The appellant
    acknowledged that he must have stabbed the deceased twice but maintained that
    it only felt like he had done so once.  The appellant testified that this confrontation occurred at the top of the
    driveway in front of the parking garage.  The appellant testified that he was scared and acted in self-defence as
    he believed he would be badly injured.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hossain testified that as he walked up the
    driveway, he was approached by the same two young men who had taken his gold
    chain.  Hossain claims that he said,
    “Well I don’t want <span class=GramE>no</span> trouble.  I just want my chain back.”  The appellant pulled a knife from behind his
    back and moved towards him.  When Hossain
    turned to run, he saw the deceased and said to him, “Let’s go, <span
class=GramE>don’t</span> worry about it.”  Hossain ran to the sidewalk and stopped.  He then turned and saw the deceased fall on the grass adjacent to the
    driveway.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A major issue in the trial was the exact
    location where the stabbing took place.  The appellant and other witnesses said the altercation took place at the
    top of the drive-way near the entrance to the parking garage.  In support of this position, the appellant
    relied on the police evidence concerning broken beer bottles and staining in
    that area.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown’s position was that the appellant was
    the aggressor, and that the deceased and his group were not looking for a fight
    but simply were seeking the return of the gold chain.  The Crown alleged that the appellant advanced
    upon and attacked the deceased further down the driveway, 38 feet from the area
    where the broken beer bottles were found.  In support of this position, the Crown relied on evidence that the
    deceased only took two steps before collapsing on the grass adjacent to the
    driveway.  The Crown argued that it would
    be impossible for the deceased to cover 38 feet in two steps.  On this factual theory, the Crown asserted
    that the defence of self-defence was severely undermined.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence of the pathologist, Dr. Toby Rose,
    was central to the issue of the deceased’s capacity to move after the
    stabbing.  Dr. Rose carried out a
    post-mortem examination of the deceased.  She found no indication of defensive injuries.  She observed two stab wounds to the chest:
    one penetrated the left ventricle of the heart; the second penetrated the upper
    lobe of the left lung.  In her opinion,
    without immediate surgery, the stab wound to the heart would cause death.  In respect of the deceased’s mobility
    immediately after suffering the stab wounds, she testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Now, when we talk about being fatal,
    either one of those injuries, would the individual have immediately collapsed
    dead?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No, I
    don’t expect so.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        All right.  <span class=GramE>Would the individual be
    able to sort of walk a few feet and then maybe collapse or not?</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        I would expect – I should say that if
    you want a lot of information like this, it’s a little bit out of my area of
    expertise, but I can certainly say that he would be expected to be able to at
    least walk a few feet before collapsing.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>The trial judge summarized Dr. Rose’s answer to the jury as follows:
    “The doctor testified that it was quite possible for Mr. Kulasingham to walk a
    few feet without collapsing having suffered these injuries.”</p>
  <h2>THE APPLICATION TO ADMIT FRESH EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant seeks to enter as
    fresh evidence an affidavit from Dr. Rose in which she provides a further
    elaboration on the potential mobility of the deceased before collapsing.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the affidavit state:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Forensic pathology literature indicates that the
    length of survival and mobility of individuals after suffering similar injuries
    is very variable.  There are case reports
    where individuals having suffered injury to the left ventricle “ran 100 meters”
    and “walked one city block”.  We have
    very little understanding of the factors that might allow an individual to be
    active after such an injury.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At trial I testified that I expected that the
    deceased would be able to “at least walk a few feet before collapsing”.  I was not asked to explain or expand upon
    this answer.  I did not mean to suggest
    that “a few feet” was the maximum distance that Mr. Kulasingham could travel
    before collapsing.  In light of the
    forensic literature noted above, I think it is possible that Mr. Kulasingham
    would have been capable of walking, or running, a distance greater than a few
    feet.  It is not possible, however, to
    determine what the maximum distance would be.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that “the
    proposed fresh evidence from Dr. Rose removes any uncertainty on this issue and
    refutes the prosecution argument that the deceased would have been unable to
    travel from the area in front of the parking garage before collapsing.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I find it unnecessary to admit the fresh
    evidence in order to decide this appeal.  As I conclude below, in my view, the trial judge erred in her charge to
    the jury in respect of Dr. Rose’s evidence.  The existing record is sufficient for this ground of appeal to form one
    of the bases for allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was central to the Crown’s case that the
    stabbing took place 38 feet from the point where the appellant testified that
    he was confronted by the deceased.  As
    indicated above, the Crown relied on evidence that the deceased took only two
    steps before collapsing on the grass adjacent to the driveway.  This supported the Crown’s theory that the
    appellant was the aggressor and took away, or at least severely <span
class=GramE>diminished,</span> the defence of self-defence.  On the other hand, the evidence of the
    pathologist that the deceased “would be expected to be able to at least walk a
    few feet before collapsing” was relied upon by the appellant to support the
    position that the confrontation occurred at the top of the driveway, after
    which the deceased made his way 38 feet down the driveway before
    collapsing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the importance of the pathologist’s

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As stated above, the trial judge instructed the
    jury that Dr. Rose “testified that it was quite possible for Mr. Kulasingham to
    walk a few feet without collapsing having suffered these injuries.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the submission of counsel for the
    appellant that the trial judge’s summary leaves the impression that the
    deceased’s maximum mobility after the stabbing would have been no more than a
    few feet.  It was important to give the
    jury the accurate description of his mobility as “at least a few feet”, thus
    leaving it to the jury to decide whether the deceased could have travelled 38
    feet before collapsing.  The appellant
    asked the trial judge to give the exact evidence to the jury but she declined
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    himself from being killed or seriously injured by Mr. Kulasingham other than by <i>killing or seriously injuring</i> Mr.
    Kulasingham?  Would a reasonable person
    have the same belief in the same circumstances?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Belief is a state of mind, Mr. Onigbinde’s state of
    mind.  To determine whether Mr. Onigbinde
    believed that he could not save himself from being killed or seriously injured
    by Mr. Kulasingham, other than by <i>killing
    or seriously injuring</i> Mr. Kulasingham, you should consider all the
    evidence.  You should consider what Mr.
    Onigbinde and Mr. Kulasingham did or did not do.  You should consider how they did or did not
    do it and you should consider what they said or did not say.  You should look at their words and conduct
    before, at the time and after Mr. Onigbinde used force against Mr. Kulasingham.  All these things and the circumstances in
    which they happen may shed light on Mr. Onigbinde’s state of mind at the
    time.  They may help you decide whether
    Mr. Onigbinde believed that he could save himself from death or serious injury
    only by <i>killing or seriously injuring</i> Mr. Kulasingham.  Use your good common
    sense.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Onigbinde’s belief must also be reasonable in
    the circumstances as Mr. Onigbinde knew or honestly believed them to be.  Would a reasonable person in those circum-stances
    have a similar belief in the need to <i>kill
    or seriously injure</i> Mr. Kulasingham to preserve himself from a similar
    fate?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A reasonable person is sane and sober, not
    exceptionally excitable, aggressive or fearful, a person who has the same
    powers of self-control that we expect our fellow citizens to exercise in
    society today.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The danger that Mr. Onigbinde was in or honestly and
    reasonably believed <span class=GramE>himself</span> to be in does not have to
    be immediate.  The immediacy or otherwise
    of it, however, is a factor for you to consider in assessing the honesty and
    reasonableness of Mr. Onigbinde’s belief.  The issue involved in this question is not whether the only actual way
    for Mr. Onigbinde to save himself from death or serious injury from Mr. Kulasingham
    was to <i>kill or cause serious injury</i> to Mr. Kulasingham.  The issue is whether
    Mr. Onigbinde honestly and reasonably believed that to do so was the only way
    to save <span class=GramE>himself</span> from a similar fate.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    charge contains two errors.  First, he
    submits that the use of the words “kill” or “killing” suggests that the
    appellant acted with the intent required for murder.  The correct instruction should have used the
    words “stab” or “stabbing”.  Second,
    counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge should have instructed
    the jury that the appellant was not required to carefully measure the force
    used to repel the deceased’s attack.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm is
    not a constituent element of self-defence under s. 34(2): see <i>R. v. Pintar</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402
    at p. 429 (Ont. C.A.) <i>per</i> Moldaver
    J.A.  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> I am not persuaded that the trial judge fell into error by her use of the words
    “kill” or “killing” in the circumstances of this case.  I note that my colleague, Justice David Watt,
    uses the word “killing” in his model charge under s. 34(2): see <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (Toronto: Carswell, 2005) at pp. 860-866.  I also note that no objection was made by defence counsel at trial to
    this aspect of the jury charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn to the second error alleged by counsel
    for the appellant in respect of the trial judge’s charge on self-defence.  This court’s judgment in <i>R. v. Baxter</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) has stood the
    test of time.  In that case, Martin J.A.
    said at p. 111:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Moreover, in deciding whether the force used by the
    accused was more than was necessary in self-defence under both s. 34(1) and (2)
    the jury must bear in mind that a person defending himself against an attack,
    reasonably apprehended, cannot be expected to weigh to a nicety, the exact
    measure of necessary defensive action…. [Citations omitted].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge declined to give a <i>Baxter</i> instruction.  Counsel for the Crown submits that the <i>Baxter</i> instruction usually applies where
    s. 34(1) and s. 34(2) are left with the jury.  In my view, the above quotation from Martin J.A. indicates that such an
    instruction applies to both ss. 34(1) and 34(2), whether they are left to the
    jury individually or in conjunction with each other.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    was no obligation on the part of the appellant to retreat.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, the jury should have been told that if
    it found, contrary to the appellant’s evidence, that he had his knife out when
    the deceased was approaching, that did not <i>per
    se</i>, negate self-defence under s. 34(2) so long as the jury was otherwise satisfied
    or had a reasonable doubt that in stabbing the deceased, the appellant was
    acting in self-defence under s. 34(2).</p>
  <h2>(iii)     Did the trial judge err in her treatment of the evidence of Peter
    Shanmuganathan?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Shanmuganathan was present at the altercation
    that occurred in the driveway of 40 Teesdale Place.  He testified that he was the cousin of the
    deceased.  On August 14, 2002 between
    1:40 a.m. and 2:34 a.m., a few hours after the altercation, he gave a video
    statement to the police under oath and under caution.  He also testified at the preliminary hearing
    and at the trial.  In his police
    statement, he said that the deceased threw a beer bottle at the accused,
    striking him in the stomach, and subsequently wielded a second bottle in his
    hand.</p>

    Shanmuganathan did not adopt his previous statements as true.  The trial judge disagreed.  The following exchange took place between
    defence counsel and the court:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Counsel:
           <span class=GramE>Your</span> Honour, based on your ruling that he has adopted the previous statement
    regarding the bottles and that we can then rely on that for the truth of its
    contents before the jury, we won’t proceed with the <i>K.G.B.</i> application. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court:     All
    right.  That’s it.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>As a result, counsel abandoned the <i>K.G.B.</i> application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant argues that in view of
    the trial judge’s ruling, she erred in failing to instruct the jury that
    certain specific portions of Mr. Shanmuganathan’s statement to the police could
    be used as evidence of their truth.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not agree with the appellant’s
    submission.  The issue of whether the
    witness adopted a prior inconsistent statement was for the jury.  (See: <i>R.
    v. Toten</i> (1993), 14 O.R. 225 (C.A.) at p. 242.)  The trial judge did give the jury the general
    charge on the use of prior inconsistent statements.  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> I do see
    a problem with the way this issue arose in the particular circumstances of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the trial judge should have

  <h2><span class=GramE>(iv)      Did</span> the trial judge err in
    excluding the evidence of the deceased’s reputation and prior discreditable
    conduct?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the defence at trial sought to
    tender evidence of the deceased’s reputation and prior disreputable conduct.  The evidence consisted of the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Evidence from Mr. Shanmuganathan, in his police
    state-ment and at the preliminary hearing, that the deceased could be
    physically aggressive when backed up by his friends.  At trial, Mr. Shanmuganathan explained that

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 9, 1998, the deceased pleaded guilty
    to carrying a concealed weapon – a 12-inch hatchet hidden in the back of his
    pants.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 1, 2000, the deceased was a passenger in a car with three other
    persons.  The car was “bumped” from the
    rear by a pickup truck.  The deceased and
    the others became embroiled in a dispute with the driver of the truck that resulted
    in the punching and kicking of the driver.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the above
    evidence is highly relevant to the issue of whether the deceased was the
    aggressor in the altercation with the appellant.  He relies on this court’s judgment in <i>R. v. Scopelliti</i> (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d)
    481 (Ont. C.A.), which also concerned the defence of self-defence to charges of
    second degree murder.  In that case, the
    trial judge admitted evidence of three prior incidents in which the deceased
    were violent and intimidating.  The accused
    were acquitted.  The Crown appealed.  Writing for the court, Martin J.A. noted at
    p. 493 that there is “no rule of policy which excludes evidence of the
    disposition of a third person for violence where that disposition has probative
    value on some issue before the jury”.  He
    then held the following at p. 496:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I agree, of course, that evidence of previous acts
    of violence by the deceased, not known to the accused, must be confined to
    evidence of previous acts of violence which may legitimately and reasonably
    assist the jury in arriving at a just verdict with respect to the accused’s
    claim of self-defence.  To exclude,
    however, evidence offered by the accused which is relevant to prove his
    innocence would not, in my view, be in the interests of justice.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Since evidence of prior acts of violence by the
    deceased is likely to arouse feelings of hostility against the deceased, there
    must inevitably be some element of discretion in the determination whether the
    proffered evidence has sufficient probative value for the purpose for which it
    is tendered to justify its admission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge excluded the reputation evidence
    of Mr. Shanmuganathan on the following basis:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Peter’s evidence about the reputation of the accused
    [<i>sic</i>], I find, in all the
    circumstances, including the evidence of Detective Sergeant Buck about the
    deceased’s parents’ lack of knowledge of their son’s propensity for violence,
    is unreliable.  Whether he is recanting
    or was initially offering opinions without any basis for the opinions about the
    deceased’s demeanour, it would be very dangerous to allow that evidence to be
    considered by a jury on the issue of self-defence in this trial.  It has no probative value in any legitimate
    determination of that issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the above
    reasoning confuses threshold and ultimate reliability.  If Mr. Shanmuganathan declined to adopt his
    prior evidence at trial, the evidence would be admissible under the principled
    exception to the hearsay rule.  I
    disagree.  This evidence seems somewhat
    thin to say the least.  The trial judge
    determined that the evidence had insufficient probative value and I would defer
    to her decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the criminal conduct of the deceased may
    be in a different category.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant argues that the trial
    judge failed to appreciate the relevance of the conviction for carrying a
    concealed weapon.  The trial judge in her
    ruling said, “I cannot see how the jury can logically be assisted by hearing
    about this incident in their determination about whether the deceased attacked
    the accused.”  Counsel for the appellant submits
    that the conviction is a circumstance supporting an inference that the deceased
    had armed himself with beer bottles, which in turn supports an inference that
    the deceased was the aggressor.  While I
    see merit in this submission, it will be for the trial judge at the new trial
    to make the call.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, counsel for the appellant submits that
    the trial judge failed to appreciate the relevance of the deceased’s
    participation in the assault on the truck driver.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, the accused will not be permitted to ask
    Peter about the so-called road rage incident in June of 2000.  Informing the jury that the deceased was
    there and was charged and then going on to flush out the facts of the incident
    as they relate to the witness, Peter, may have the effect of the jury finding
    the deceased guilty by mere association without having the issue reviewed in
    its entirety by a voir dire and upon properly adduced evidence.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>After the deceased’s death, Dobney J. of the Ontario Court of
    Justice presided at the assault trial of the three other people in the
    car.  She noted, “It is relatively common
    ground amongst all of them that the fourth person, Mr. Kulasingham got involved
    at the end, but was indeed involved.”  She further found that “at the time of the altercation, there were four
    young men surrounding [the driver].”  These
    findings lead me to conclude that guilt “by mere association” is not a
    concern.  The deceased’s participation in
    a gang of four in assaulting one person is probative of the identity of the
    aggressor in the confrontation between the deceased and the appellant.  However, again the issue is for the judge
    presiding at the new trial. </p>
  <h2>(v)       Did the trial judge err in ruling that no adverse inference

    Thangavel Manoharasivam?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her opening address to the jury, Crown
    counsel told the jury that she anticipated Thangavel Manoharasivam (“Mano”)
    would testify for the prosecution:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You will hear from Peter, Jenan, Mano, Myron and
    Haines Jones that they did not go to Teesdale to fight, they were just hanging
    out at Crescent Town Park playing cards and having a beer.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=GramE>After Azmal asked for their help,

    Mano tell you that he knew the people at Teesdale and that he did not want to
    have a fight with them, and in fact he went over there specifically for that
    reason.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mano was called by the Crown in a <i>voir dire</i> during the course of the
    trial.  During the <i>voir dire</i> he gave evidence, which was favourable to the position of
    the defence, to the effect that there was a plan afoot to attack the appellant.  He also testified that they were simply going
    to talk to the appellant.  The Crown
    advised the court that she had decided not to call Mano in the trial because he
    was “unreliable”.  At the close of the
    Crown’s case, defence counsel requested that the court call Mano as a
    witness.  In the alternative, defence
    counsel asked the judge to comment on the failure of the Crown to call the
    witness.  The trial judge refused the
    request to call the witness.  There is no
    issue about the exercise of her discretion in this respect.  She further ruled that defence counsel could
    comment on the failure of the Crown to call Mano but could not advise the jury
    that they could draw an adverse inference.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a long and well-established practice in
    both the civil and criminal courts of this province that in certain
    circumstances – such as these – counsel can invite the trier of fact to draw an
    adverse inference when opposing counsel declined to call a witness from whom it
    is anticipated relevant evidence will be tendered.  It is clear from the record that the Crown
    originally intended to call Mano.  It is
    equally clear that the Crown changed her mind because she believed the witness
    would not help her case.  I am not
    persuaded that she meant anything else by describing the witness as
    “unreliable”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the Crown on this appeal submits
    that defence counsel, in his address to the jury, made statements that were
    tantamount to an invitation to the jury to draw an adverse inference.  While the Crown makes a valid point, none of defence
    counsel’s comments expressly invites the jury to conclude that if Mano had been
    called, his evidence would have been unhelpful to the Crown.  In my view, defence counsel was at least
    entitled to make that express submission to the jury: see <i>R. v. Jolivet</i> (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.).  </p>
