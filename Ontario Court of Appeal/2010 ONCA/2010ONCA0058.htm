  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for sexual
    assault and two related breach of probation charges. He raises the following
    three grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge impermissibly used certain evidence to confirm the complainant’s testimony
    that she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasoning process was tainted by Crown counsel’s improper and
    unfair questioning of the appellant; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge failed to correctly apply the principles in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> in arriving at his credibility findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we do not accept these
    grounds of appeal.  Accordingly, the
    appeal must be dismissed.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Ground One: Improper use of evidence to confirm the complainant’s
    testimony</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    ground of appeal hinges on the appellant’s contention that, because the
    complainant was an admitted alcohol and drug addict and as she acknowledged
    having lied about her desire to obtain crack cocaine from the appellant, both
    to the police and while under oath at the appellant’s preliminary inquiry, a
    conviction could not be based on her evidence alone; rather, independent
    confirmatory evidence of her account of events was required.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Within
    that framework, the appellant points to two items of information contained in a
    sexual assault report prepared shortly after the alleged incident, which he
    says the trial judge improperly found to be confirmatory of the complainant’s
    evidence. The two items in question form part of the recorded observations of
    the complainant’s condition shortly after the alleged assault.  They are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>TEARS – tears, ecchymosis abrasions
    redness swelling; and</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Posterior Fourchette and
    Introitus:  1 cm area of redness very
    tender when swabbed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown concedes that the second of these items was not confirmatory of the
    complainant’s evidence but, rather, was a neutral factor.  In other words, it did not assist in
    determining whether the admitted sex between the appellant and the complainant
    was non-consensual. The Crown also concedes that the trial judge’s reliance on
    the first factor, which was simply an explanation of an acronym, arose from his
    misapprehension of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the same time, the Crown points to three other items in the same report that
    are confirmatory of the complainant’s evidence and that the trial judge
    properly referenced in his reasons, namely:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>fine scratches on the complainant’s
    left buttock;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>abraided [sic] area on the
    complainant’s shoulder; and</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>fine grains of dirt – one collected
    on genital swab.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Those
    three items, the Crown submits, are consistent with the complainant’s claim
    that the sexual assault occurred on a dirt path while she was lying on her back
    after being forced to the ground by the appellant. They are not consistent with
    the appellant’s evidence that he and the complainant engaged in consensual sex
    earlier that day on a bed in the complainant’s trailer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown also points to other items of confirmatory evidence that the trial judge
    properly considered, including the evidence of the complainant’s prolonged distraught
    condition and her dirty clothing, the latter of which supports her testimony
    that she had been forced to the ground. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant accepts that the items referred to by the Crown are potentially
    confirmatory of a sexual assault.  Nonetheless, he submits that the two challenged items from the sexual
    assault report, above-described, were highly material. In particular, he
    contends that the first item (the explanation of the acronym), more than
    anything else, attests to the forcible nature of the alleged sexual encounter. He
    argues, therefore, that this item must have figured prominently in the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the complainant had been sexually assaulted. As the
    Crown cannot show that the verdict would inevitably have been the same had the
    trial judge not considered this item, a new trial is required.  </span></p>

    disagree. The appellant’s argument is based on the false premise that the trial
    judge viewed this as a case in which it would be unsafe to register a
    conviction on the complainant’s evidence, without more.</span></p>

    trial judge was alive to the complainant’s drug and alcohol problems, but he
    provided cogent reasons for concluding that they did not affect her ability to
    recall the crucial events giving rise to the charge of sexual assault.
    Likewise, he found that her alcohol consumption on the day in question was not
    material to her recollection of the events. Those findings were open to the
    trial judge and we see no basis for interfering with them. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge was also alive to the complainant’s “lies” to the police and her
    false evidence at the preliminary inquiry concerning her desire for crack
    cocaine. Nonetheless, he accepted the complainant’s explanation for why she had
    not told the truth and did not find her lies on this issue determinative of the
    “other evidence as to what occurred [on the day in question].” This, too, was a
    finding within the trial judge’s purview and we see no basis for interfering
    with it. </span></p>

    our view, those findings undercut the appellant’s submission that confirmatory
    evidence was essential to warrant a conviction. The trial judge did not view
    this as a case in which it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence of the
    complainant absent confirmatory evidence.  In the initial part of his reasons, he carefully considered the evidence
    of the complainant and that of the appellant and provided coherent reasons for
    accepting the complainant’s version of events and rejecting the appellant’s
    testimony.  Hence, it was technically unnecessary
    for him to search for confirmatory evidence. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    having elected to do so, the trial judge properly relied on the evidence of the
    complainant’s emotional condition, her dirty clothing, the abrasions and
    scratches on her shoulder and buttock, and the grains of dirt found on the
    vaginal swab, all of which he viewed as confirmatory of her testimony.  The trial judge made no error in doing so.  </span></p>

    in that light and reading his reasons as a whole, we agree with the Crown’s
    submission that the trial judge’s misapprehension of one entry in the sexual
    assault report and his description of a neutral factor as confirmatory evidence
    are inconsequential. There was more than ample evidence to support the trial
    judge’s finding that the complainant had been sexually assaulted as she claimed.  </span></p>

    appellant argues that the Crown engaged in improper cross-examination by
    putting the appellant in the position of having to explain matters that were
    beyond the realm of his knowledge.  The
    effect of this, the appellant submits, was to place a burden on the appellant
    to explain the complainant’s actions.  The appellant argues that his inability to respond to the Crown’s improper
    questions in cross-examination shaped the trial judge’s adverse credibility
    findings against him.  </span></p>

    agree with the appellant that, on several occasions, Crown counsel [not
    Ms.&nbsp;Crosbie] exceeded the bounds of permissible cross-examination, as
    alleged.   That said, we are not
    persuaded that this influenced the trial judge’s reasoning process.  In arriving at his credibility findings, the
    trial judge made no reference to the appellant’s evidence in respect of the
    impugned questioning or to his inability to respond to that questioning.  On the contrary, the trial judge’s
    credibility assessment was grounded on other proper factors. </span></p>
