style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The main issue before the motion judge was
    whether there was a genuine issue for trial concerning whether Lafontaine-Rish
    Medical Group Ltd. (“LRMG”<span class=GramE>)  and</span> Lafontaine Jeunesse Corporation (“LJC”) are privies and
    whether the doctrine of issue estoppel should therefore apply to prohibit LJC
    from re-litigating issues that were dealt with in the respondent's action
    against LRMG.  In our view, the motion
    judge made no error in concluding, in effect, that there was no genuine issue
    for trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As was noted by the motion judge, there was no
    dispute concerning various shared characteristics of the companies. They
    carried on the same cosmetic surgery business (not at the same time), at the
    same location and used the same key employees.  LJC began its operations just after LRMG ceased carrying on the cosmetic
    surgery business. They had the same telephone number and website information. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Most importantly, Arthur Froom was a director,
    principal shareholder and the controlling mind of both companies and had
    exclusive authority for litigation management of both companies. Before the
    motion judge, counsel for Mr. Froom conceded that Mr. Froom knew that LJC, and
    not LRMG, was likely the proper party defendant to the respondent's action as
    it was originally framed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Considered in this context, we see no air of
    reality to the suggestion that there was a genuine issue for trial concerning
    whether LRMG and LJC were privies of one another. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, given that Mr. Froom was the directing
    mind of both companies, it is apparent that LJC knew that the respondent had
    sued the wrong party, in claiming against LRMG.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As of the date of the respondent’s summary
    judgment motion against LJC, it had already been finally determined that
    because LRMG made a deliberate choice not to defend the respondent's action it
    was<b> </b>barred from setting aside the
    respondent's default judgment. Because LRMG and LJC are privies, we can see no
    genuine issue concerning whether LJC too is bound by that choice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor do we accept LRMG’s argument that the motion
    judge erred by failing to conclude that the principle of cause of action estoppel
    gives rise to a genuine issue regarding whether it is open to the respondent to
    sue LJC in this case.  Even assuming that
    cause of action estoppel was a live issue before the motion judge, which is far
    from clear on the record before us, it is our view that it does not give rise
    to a genuine issue for trial for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the only evidence to which LRMG can point
    in support of its argument that the respondent knew or ought to have known,
    prior to obtaining default judgment against LRMG, that it sued the wrong
    corporate defendant, is a letter dated November 29, 2007 from the respondent’s
    family physician to the respondent’s counsel indicating that the respondent had
    attended the “Lafontaine Jeunesse Clinic” on January 18, 2007.  On any reasonable reading, this brief
    reference cannot be said to fix the respondent’s counsel with actual knowledge
    that two separate Lafontaine corporations existed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, although Mr. Froom, the principal
    shareholder and controlling mind of LRMG and LJC, knew from the outset that the
    respondent had sued the wrong company, he did nothing for about six months
    after service of the original statement of claim to inform the respondent of
    this error.  Indeed, on the contrary,
    LRMG delivered a Notice of Intent to Defend without any accompanying disclosure
    of the existence and involvement of LJC.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the record establishes that none of the
    publically available information regarding the cosmetic surgery clinic could
    have alerted the respondent, on reasonable inquiry, to the existence of two
    separate corporations. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the eventual joinder of LJC to the
    action was brought about by a <i>consent</i> pleadings amendment. Thus, LJC not only failed to resist the amendment adding
    it as a party to the action – on the ground of cause of action estoppel or
    otherwise – it facilitated that very amendment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In these circumstances, LRMG cannot rely on the
    invocation of cause of action estoppel to defeat the respondent’s summary
    judgment motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The costs
    of the appeal will be to the respondent on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in
    the amount of $7,500.00, including disbursements and GST.</p>
