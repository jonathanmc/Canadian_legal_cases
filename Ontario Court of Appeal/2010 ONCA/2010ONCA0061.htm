    enter upon the property owned by the appellants, William Leonard Cutting and

    history of the property ownership is succinctly set out in the appellants’
    factum.  In the 1920’s William Rosseau
    Cutting, great-grandfather of the appellant Bill Cutting, registered a plan of
    subdivision, Plan 139 at Port Ryerse, a small community located on the shores
    of Lake Erie.  That plan of subdivision
    included:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>(a) cottage
    lots 19 and 20, which together totalled 100 feet in width, acquired by Andy Bell, grandfather of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>(b) cottage
    lots 16 and 17, which together totalled 100 feet in width, acquired by Louise and Kurt Schwark,

    lots 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 acquired by the appellants Cutting fromthe appellant Bill Cutting’s

    the deeds to those properties do not include access of any kind to the beach/lake.  The cottages on those lots were built at the top
    of the bank.  The water lots were not
    buildable but separated the cottage lots from Lake Erie.  The Cuttings’ building lots were across the
    street from the cottage lots.</span></p>

    witnessed Andy Bell constructing the <span class=SpellE>berm</span> in front of
    his cottage and witnessed his father, William O. Cutting, threatening to sue
    him if he continued. He also noted that there was no evidence of any of the

    was conflicting evidence over the hilltop cottager’s use of the water
    lots.  The Bell witnesses testified to
    their use of the waterfront lots from the early ‘70’s without objection.  The Schwark witnesses testified to the same
    effect.  They both testified that it was
    not until the fall of 1998, when the appellant Bill Cutting placed blue barrels
    and brush on the path at about a line between the south limit of their
    respective cottage lots and the appellants’ water lots, that this right to use
    the beach was challenged.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge accepted the evidence of the appellants that in 1988 they gave
    permission to the Bells to use the water lots in exchange for the Bells
    granting them permission to use the stairs they had constructed behind their
    cottage, to access the beach.  Similar
    permission was given to Louise Schwark at her request in 1989.  The trial judge also concluded that the Bells
    and Schwarks would have been aware that the appellants had acquired the water
    lots in 1988, seen the “no trespassing” signs placed on the berm in front of
    their cottages and been aware that they could only use the beach with the
    permission of the Cuttings.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge then considered the alternate claim based on proprietary
    estoppel.  In his consideration of the
    law, he relied heavily on a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Zelmer v. Victor Projects Ltd.</i>,
    [1997] B.C.J. No. 1044 (B.C.C.A.). However, the trial judge failed to apply the

    seminal case on proprietary estoppel is the decision of the English Court of
    Appeal in <i>Crabb v. Arun District Council</i>, <i>supra</i>. The plaintiff, Crabb, and the defendant,
    District Council (DC) were adjoining landowners.  The two properties had previously been owned
    by the same party.  Under the conveyance
    by which he acquired title to his two-acre parcel, Crabb was also granted a
    right of access at a point described as “A” to a proposed new road and a right
    along it to the public road.  When DC
    acquired the adjoining three and one-half acre parcel, the grantors expressly
    reserved the right (which they had already granted to Mr. Crabb) for the owner
    of the two-acre parcel to have access at point A to the proposed new road and a
    right of way along it to the public road.  DC agreed to erect a fence along the boundary line between the two
    properties save for the access gap at point A.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sometime
    later Mr. Crabb decided to divide his property in two portions and sell them
    separately for separate use.  The access
    point he already enjoyed at A would serve the front half of his property.  He required a second point of access at point
    B to serve the back half of his property, together with a right of way along
    the proposed new road to the public road.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    July 26, 1967 Mr. Crabb and his architect met with a representative of DC.  At that meeting it was agreed that Mr. Crabb
    should have an additional access at point B so as to give access from the back
    portion of his land over the new proposed road.  During the winter of 1967 DC erected the fence along the agreed boundary
    leaving gaps at points A and B.  In
    February/March 1968, DC had gates constructed at points A and B, the posts for
    the gates were set in concrete and were clearly intended to be permanent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Later
    in 1968 Mr. Grabb sold the front portion of his land to a purchaser and
    assigned to him the right of access at point A.  In so doing, Mr. Crabb did not reserve any right for himself (as owner
    of the back portion) to go over the front portion so as to get out at Point A.  He thought he already had a right to exit at
    point B (where gates had already been erected) and so had no need to reserve
    for <span class=GramE>himself</span> any right to get to point A.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    January 1969, Mr. Crabb put a padlock on the inside of the gate at point
    B.  This action on his part evidently
    incensed the DC who went upon Mr. Crabb’s land, took down the gates at point B,
    pulled the posts out of the concrete and filled the gap with fence to match the
    rest of the fence along the boundary and effectively shut the access at point B,
    leaving Crabb’s remaining property landlocked.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    DC then agreed that Crabb could have access at point B but only at an
    exorbitant cost.  <span class=SpellE>Crabb</span> brought an action claiming a right of access at point B together with a right
    of way along the new proposed road to the public road. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    strict letter of the law Mr. Crabb had no right by deed, conveyance or written
    agreement. The DC was entitled to its land subject only to an easement at point
    A, but none at point B.  The plaintiff
    advanced his case on the basis of proprietary estoppel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his reasons for judgment at p. 187 Lord Denning explained the basis for the
    claim as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    basis of this proprietary estoppel – as indeed of promissory estoppels – is the
    interposition of equity.  Equity comes
    in, true to form, to mitigate the rigours of strict law.  The early cases did not speak of it as
    “estoppels”.  They spoke of it as
    “raising <span class=GramE>an equity</span>”.  If I may expand what Lord Cairns L.C. said in <i>Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co</i>. (1877) 2 App. <span class=GramE>Cas</span>.
    439, 448:  </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>‘<span
class=GramE>it</span> is the first principle upon which all courts of equity
    proceed,’</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>that</span></span><span lang=EN-US> it will prevent a person from insisting on his
    strict legal rights – whether arising under a contract, or on his title deeds,
    or by statute – when it would be inequitable for him to do so having regard to
    the dealings which have taken place between the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>What
    then are the dealings which will preclude him from insisting on his strict
    legal rights?  If he makes a binding
    contract that he will not insist on the strict legal position, a court of
    equity will hold him to his promise. Short of a binding contract, if he makes a
    promise that he will not insist on his strict legal rights – then, even though
    that promise may be unenforceable in point of law for want of consideration or
    want of writing – then if he makes the promise knowing or intending that the
    other will act upon it, and he does act upon it, then again a court of equity
    will not allow him to go back on that promise (citations omitted).  Short of an actual promise, if he, by his
    words or conduct, so behaves as to lead another to believe that he will not
    insist on his strict legal rights – knowing or intending that the other will
    act on that belief – and he <span class=GramE>does</span> so act – that again
    will raise an equity in favour of the other.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge dismissed the action essentially having found there was only an
    “agreement in principle” following the July 16, 1967 meeting and no “definite
    assurance”.  The Court of Appeal saw it
    differently. The fact that DC had put up a gate at point B at “considerable
    expense” led the plaintiff to believe that there was an agreement giving him the
    right to access at point B.  As Lord
    Denning M.R. explains at page 189:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    defendants knew that the plaintiff <i>intended</i> to sell the two portions separately and that he would need an access at point B
    as well as point A.  Seeing that they
    knew of his intention – and they did nothing to disabuse him but rather
    confirmed it by erecting gates at point B – it was their conduct which led him
    to act as he did: and this raises <span class=GramE>an equity</span> in his <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> against him [emphasis in original].</span></p>

    his separate reasons Scarman L.J. considered the judgment of Fry J. in <i>Wilmott v. Barber</i> (1880), 15 Ch.D. 96
    which he considered “a valuable guide as to the matters of fact which have to
    be established in order that a plaintiff may establish this particular
    equity”.  It is worthwhile to repeat what
    Fry J. said at pages 105-6 of his judgment:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    has been said that the acquiescence which will deprive a man of his legal
    rights must amount to fraud, and in my view that is an abbreviated statement of
    a very true proposition.  A man is not to
    be deprived of his legal rights unless he has acted in such a way as would make
    it fraudulent for him to set up those rights.  What, then, are the elements or requisites necessary to constitute fraud
    of that description?  In the first place
    the plaintiff must have made a mistake as to his legal rights. Secondly, the
    plaintiff must have expanded some money or must have done some act (not
    necessarily upon the defendant’s land) on the faith of his mistaken
    belief.  Thirdly, the defendant, the
    possessor of the legal right, must know of the existence of his own right which
    is inconsistent with the right claimed by the plaintiff.   If he does not know of it he is in the same
    position as the plaintiff, and the doctrine of acquiescence is founded upon
    conduct with <span class=GramE>a knowledge</span> of your legal rights.  Fourthly, the defendant, the possessor of the
    legal right, must know of the plaintiff’s mistaken belief of his rights.  If he does not, there is nothing which calls
    upon him to assert his own rights.  <span
class=GramE>Lastly, …</span> the defendant, the possessor of the legal rights,
    must have encouraged the plaintiff in his expenditure of money or in the other
    acts which he has done, either directly or by abstaining from asserting his
    legal right.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>But
    it is clear that whether one uses the word “fraud” or not, the plaintiff has to
    establish as a fact that the defendant, by setting up his right, is taking
    advantage of him in a way which is unconscionable, inequitable or unjust …</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This
    court therefore cannot find an equity established unless it is prepared to go
    as far as to say that it would <span class=GramE>be  unconscionable</span> and unjust to allow the
    defendants to set up their undoubted rights against the claim being made by the
    plaintiff. In order to reach a conclusion upon that matter the court does have
    to consider the history of the negotiations under the five headings to which
    Fry J. referred.</span></p>

    the British Columbia Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Zalmer v. Victor Projects Ltd</i>., upon which the trial judge relied,
    the facts are set out in the headnote as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    plaintiff developers contacted the defendant owner of the adjoining parcel of
    land and requested permission to build a reservoir on the defendant’s property
    to serve their subdivisions.  After an
    initial meeting, the plaintiff’s engineer met with the defendant’s principal
    and engineer at the site and pointed out the desired location for construction
    of the reservoir.  The plaintiffs
    understood from that meeting that the defendant could grant, gratuitously, the
    easement for the area occupied by the reservoir and its ancillary works.  The plaintiffs had the site surveyed and
    provided the defendant with the plan, asking if there were any concerns with
    the site.  Without speaking to his
    principal, the defendant’s engineer acknowledged receipt of the plan and said
    he had no concerns with the proposed location but that formal approval from the
    principal would be necessary.  The
    defendant did not review the plan and was unaware that the reservoir was built
    in its actual location until after its completion. He refused to provide an
    easement alleging that he told the plaintiffs’ engineer that the reservoir
    would only be acceptable in a gully north of the spot he had indicated. The
    plaintiff commenced proceedings and applied for a declaration as to the
    existence of an equitable easement.  The
    application was granted at trial.  The
    plaintiff was entitled to the declaration sought even though the defendant
    clearly had a different location in mind for the reservoir than where it was
    actually built.  The defendant had led
    all those present at the site meeting to believe that he was agreeable to the
    reservoir being constructed at its present location. When the defendants’
    engineer was asked if he had any concerns about the location of the reservoir,
    the plaintiff’s engineer was established to assume that he was speaking on
    behalf of the defendant and the plaintiff’s engineer was entitled to proceed in
    the manner he did.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>50 I
    now turn to consider whether, on the facts of this case, the plaintiffs
    established their claim against the defendant on the basis of proprietary
    estoppel.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>51 I
    shall consider the question on the basis of the third alternative expressed by
    Lord Denning in <i>Crabb</i>: <i>i.e.</i></span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>…
    if he, by his words or conduct, so behaves as to lead another to believe that
    he will not insist on his strict legal rights – knowing or intending that the
    other will act upon that belief – and he does so act …</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>52  At the meeting on site on 6 August 1992
    Mr. Bennett agreed that the plaintiffs could construct the water reservoir on
    his land at a location which the plaintiffs’ witnesses testified was the location
    at which it was in fact installed.  On 11
    August 1992 Mr. Pilling faxed to Mr. Bennett the particulars of the easement to
    which Mr. Bennett did not respond.  The
    fax of his agent, Mr. Tomlinson, to Mr. Pilling on 13 August confirmed the
    location.  The statement by Mr. Bennett
    to Mr. Gossett to the effect that he would be a good neighbor and  would not require compensation for the land
    which would be subject to the easement, confirmed that the easement would  be given on a gratuitous basis.  In my view the words or conduct of Mr.
    Bennett, including those of his agent, Mr. Tomlinson, taken as a whole, led the
    plaintiffs to believe that they had the approval of Mr. Bennett to construct
    the reservoir and would be granted an easement.  I find that the equitable doctrine of proprietary estoppel has been
    established.</span></p>

    in considering the respondents’ claim based on proprietary estoppel the trial
    judge in his analysis of the evidence merely reiterated the use the respondents
    and their families had historically made of the water lots owned by the
    appellants. At paragraph 103 of his reasons he concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Bill
    Cutting and Brenda Cutting and Bill Cutting’s grandfather, William Owen
    Cutting, who preceded Bill and Brenda in owning the waterfront lots, have
    acquiesced in the Bell and Schwark extended families using the beach and
    gaining access to the beach over the berm, at least since 1971 for the Bells,
    which is 37 years, and at least since 1976 for the Schwarks, which is 32
    years.  The Bell and Schwark extended families
    have developed a lifestyle and have established family traditions rooted in the
    use of the beach.  In doing so, they have
    relied upon the facet or explicit consent of the owners of the waterfront lots
    to their use of the beach and their being able to access the beach across the
    berm.  In my view, it would be
    unconscionable for the Court now to permit Bill Cutting and Brenda Cutting to
    enforce their legal property rights by excluding the Bell and Schwark extended
    families from the beach.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Proprietary
    estoppel is a form of promissory estoppel.  It is commonly supposed that estoppel cannot give rise to a cause of
    action, but proprietary estoppel appears to be an exception to that rule: see
    Lord Denning in <i>Crabb v. Arun District
    Council</i> (1975), 1 Ch. 179 (Eng. C.A.) at 187-188.  But there must be an estoppel. The basic
    tenets of proprietary estoppel are described in McGee, Snell’s Equity, 13 <span

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>Without

    detriment in any way by relying on a belief that they had such a right.  The construction of the berm in the 70’s was
    objected to by the appellants’ predecessor in title at the time.  There was no evidence that any money was
