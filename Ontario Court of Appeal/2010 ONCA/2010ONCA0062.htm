    J., dated June 10, 2008, wherein he granted judgment in favour of the appellant

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants’ argument in summary form is that
    the trial judge either ignored entirely, failed to appreciate or misapprehended
    material evidence, which formed the factual matrix within which the contract in
    issue was negotiated, in interpreting the subject contract.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They argue, the factual matrix must inform the
    interpretation process.  As this court
    said in <i>Dumbrell v. The Regional Group of
    Companies Inc. et al</i>. (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 616 at paras. 53 through 57:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[53]     The
    text of the written agreement must be read as a whole and in the context of the
    circumstances as they existed when the agreement was created. The circumstances
    include facts that were known or reasonably capable of being known by the
    parties when they entered into the written agreement: see [page 631] BG Checo
    International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, [1993] 1
    S.C.R. 12, [1993] S.C.J. No. 1, at pp. 23-24 S.C.R.; H.W. Liebig &amp; Co. v.
    Leading Investments Ltd., [1986] 1 S.C.R. 70, [1986] S.C.J. No. 6, at pp. 80-81
    S.C.R., La Forest J.; Prenn v. Simmonds, [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1381, [1971] 3 All
    E.R. 237 (H.L.), at pp. 1383-84 W.L.R.; Staughton, “How Do the Courts Interpret
    Commercial Contracts?”, supra, at 307-08.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[54]     A
    consideration of the context in which the written agreement was made in an
    integral part of the interpretative process and is not something that is
    resorted to only where the words viewed in isolation suggest some ambiguity. To
    find ambiguity, one must come to certain conclusions as to the meaning of the words
    used.  A conclusion as to the meaning of
    words used in a written contract can only be properly reached if the contract
    is considered in the context in which it was made: see McCamus, The Law of
    Contracts (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2005) at 710-11.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[55]     There
    is some controversy as to how expansively context should be examined for the
    purposes of contractual interpretation: see Geoff R. Hall, “A Curious Incident
    in the Law of Contract: The Impact of 22 Words from the House of Lords” (2004)
    40 Can. Bus. L.J. 20. Insofar as written agreements are concerned, the context,
    or as it is sometimes called the “factual matrix”, clearly extends to the
    genesis of the agreement, its purpose, and the commercial context in which the
    agreement was made: Kentucky Fried Chicken Canada, a Division of Pepsi-Cola
    Canada Ltd. v. Scott’s Food Services Inc., [1998] O.J. No. 4368, 114 O.A.C. 357
    (C.A.), at p. 636 O.A.C.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[56]     I
    would adopt the description of the interpretative process provided by Lord
    Justice Steyn, “The Intracticable Problem of the Interpretation of Legal
    Texts”, supra, at 8:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>In sharp contrast with civil legal systems the
    common law adopts a largely objective theory to the interpretation of
    contracts. The purpose of the interpretation of a contract is not to discover how
    the parties understood the language of the text, which they adopted.  The aim is to determine the meaning of the
    contract against its objective contextual scene.  By and large the objective approach to the
    question of construction serves the needs of commerce.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(Emphasis added) </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) The interpretation of this contract</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[57]     The
    context in which the written words used in this agreement must be understood
    begins with the parties who negotiated the agreement.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1995 the RCGA was unhappy with the quality of
    its published magazine, Golf Canada, and approached the appellant about taking
    over the publishing.  Negotiations
    followed among Wayne Narciso and Mary Ann Crooker on behalf of the appellant
    and Scott Simmons on behalf of RCGA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eventually the parties came to agree on a number
    of essential terms of an agreement referenced in these proceedings as the “Handshake
    Agreement”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons for judgment the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>5    </b>It is the position of LO that
    Wayne Narciso, the President and Mary Anne Crooker representing it, met with
    Scott Simmons representing the RCGA.  As
    a result of this meeting, the parties entered into an agreement that LO would
    be the new publisher and that LO accepted that offer on the understanding that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>*    Circulation would be negotiated</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>*    The contract term would be ten years</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>*    The magazine would have a new design</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>*    The RCGA would hire a new editor</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>6    </b>It is the position of LO that
    there was a deal.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>7    </b>This contract allegedly entered
    into between the parties was an oral contract. In deciding what agreement was
    reached, if any, the credibility of the individuals involved is of prime importance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>8    </b>I am satisfied on all the evidence
    before me, including the subsequent events and including the signing of the
    contract, that Narciso and Crooker both knew that Scott Simmons had no
    authority to negotiate and/or enter into a contract on behalf of the defendant.
    In particular, and, whether or not in fact, there was a handshake; I find
    Narciso knew there was no agreement reached at that time. His testimony at
    trial that an agreement was reached is not credible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants did not argue that the “handshake
    agreement” was the agreement of the parties.  They argued only that the “handshake” was an important part of the
    factual matrix to be considered by the trial judge, in particular in
    interpreting the renewal clause of the final written agreement between the
    parties.  The trial judge misapprehended
    this argument.  Further, he rejected Mr.
    Narciso’s evidence as “not credible” but gave no reason why he rejected his
    evidence.  It is clear from the reasons
    that the trial judge accepted little if any, of Mr. Narciso’s evidence, but
    nowhere in his reasons does he disclose the basis for his disbelief.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reading the trial judge’s reasons Mr. Narciso
    would have no idea why the trial judge did not believe him – neither does this
    court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is apparent on the record that Laurel Oak was
    desirous of a long-term contract in view of the considerable investment that
    would be required of it if it agreed to publish Golf Canada.  While it was able initially to negotiate a
    10-year term with Mr. Simmons, the directors of the respondent (to whom Simmons
    reported) would not agree to 10 years.  Instead, after much to-ing and fro-ing, the parties settled on a fixed
    5-year term and an extension or renewal clause as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This agreement shall commence on the date executed
    beginning with the April 1996 issue and shall continue until the publication of
    the Fall issue of the year 2000. On January 1, 2000, the RCGA and Laurel Oak
    shall initiate good faith negotiations concerning the extension of this
    agreement for the publication of Golf Canada for a further 5 year period.  If Laurel Oak has discharged its obligations
    under this Agreement in a reasonably satisfactory Manner throughout the term
    hereof, and if at the end of such term RCGA has not decided to discontinue the
    endorsement of the Publication, Laurel Oak shall have preferred status over any
    other potential publishing group to publish the publication for the said five
    year extension.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The contract required that the parties would on
    January 1, 2000, “initiate good faith negotiations” concerning the extension of
    the contract for a further five years.  There is no issue but that Laurel Oak had discharged its obligations in
    a reasonably satisfactory manner – and the respondent was desirous of continuing
    to publish the magazine.  The appellant
    was to have “preferred status” over any other potential publishing group to
    publish the magazine for the next five years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was the position of the appellants that the
    respondent did not “negotiate” a renewal with it at all.  It requested a written proposal and
    thereafter issued a Request for Proposal to the appellant and other
    publishers.  They further say the
    respondent had decided to issue a request for proposal before the January 1,
    2000 deadline and never intended to negotiate with the defendant in good faith
    or otherwise.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three important pieces of evidence in relation

    Narciso “Lets gas him”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This evidence was material and yet it appears to

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There were difficulties with the publication
    from the outset.  It is obvious from the
    copy of the 1994 inaugural magazine that was provided to the appellant as a
    template, and filed in evidence, that advertising, which the respondent would
    not permit the appellant to accept, had been permitted to the previous
    publisher.  Indeed, the record discloses
    that similar advertising – denied to the appellant – was permitted to the
    subsequent publisher.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nowhere in his reasons does the trial judge deal
    with this important evidence.  Similar
    complaints were made in relation to the editorial content where it appeared the
    appellant may have been treated differently from the former and subsequent
    publishers, yet this evidence is not considered anywhere in the reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The written agreement between the parties
    provided for bulk delivery of the magazine to golf clubs.  It was subsequently agreed that the bulk
    delivery could be done by courier rather than postal delivery to reduce costs.  Teri Yomada of the respondent confirmed that
    arrangement by correspondence, dated March 22, 1996, to Wayne Narciso which
    stated “all shipments will be via courier”.  In paragraph 37 of his reasons the trial judge states “There was no
    evidence that RCGA agreed that bulk deliveries would be done by courier rather than
    postal delivery to reduce costs”.  That
    statement appears to be contradicted by the respondent’s March 22, 1996, letter
    with which the trial judge does not deal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Overall the trial judge’s reasons are conclusory

    the conclusions he did on important points.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition the appellant filed detailed written

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When it became apparent on receipt of the
    reasons for judgment that the trial judge had not read the reply submissions,
    counsel for the respondent quite properly wrote to the trial judge, included a
    copy of the appellants’ reply submissions with his letter and invited the trial
    judge to make whatever changes he considered appropriate to his reasons in
    light of those submissions.  It is not
    clear from the record whether the trial judge ever, in fact, read those
    submissions as was his obligation.</p>
