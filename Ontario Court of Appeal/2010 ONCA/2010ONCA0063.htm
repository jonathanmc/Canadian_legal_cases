class=GramE>,  dismissing</span> his
    motion to set aside the consent order of Miller J., dated February 27, 2008.  The Royal Bank of Canada had obtained a
    default judgment against the appellant for $52,730.85 pursuant to the appellant’s
    guarantee of <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> Inc.’s debt to the bank.  Justice Miller’s order amended that judgment
    by adding the alias “Ian Israel Korman” to the title of proceedings and adding
    to the judgment declarations that the judgment and a subsequently obtained cost
    award were in fraud.  For the reasons
    that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the motion judge’s order and
    substitute <span class=SpellE>therefor</span> an order in its place setting
    aside the declaratory parts of the consent order of Miller J.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant was one of two principals of <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span>, a
    corporation registered in Ontario.  In
    late 2005 and January 2006, <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> incurred debt
    with the bank by way of overdraft.  In
    April 2006, after the bulk of this debt had been incurred, the appellant agreed
    to guarantee <span class=SpellE>Futurecom’s</span> debt personally.  When <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> defaulted, the bank issued a claim against the appellant pursuant to his
    guarantee.  The appellant did not defend
    and on April 12, 2007, the bank obtained default judgment in the amount of
    $52,730.85, together with costs fixed in the amount of $543.00.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    September 12, 2007, the bank obtained an order compelling the appellant to
    attend an examination-in-aid-of-execution and to pay $1,432.48 in costs thrown
    away.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the course of the examination-in-aid-of-execution, the bank became aware that
    some of the statements made by the appellant in the personal statement of
    affairs he had provided to the bank were false.  The bank also learned that the appellant’s correct name was Israel Ian
    Korman rather than Ian Israel Korman as the bank had previously
    understood.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    a result of obtaining this information, the bank brought a motion seeking an
    order under r. 59.06(2)(a) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 to amend the judgment previously
    obtained by correcting the appellant’s name and adding declarations that the
    judgment and subsequent cost order were sums owing in fraud.  The bank sought this relief even though the
    statement of claim pursuant to which the default judgment had been obtained had
    not alleged fraud, nor sought any form of declaratory relief.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Notice
    of the motion was served on the appellant’s solicitor.  The solicitor clearly misunderstood the nature
    and scope of the relief sought.  He
    understood only that the bank alleged that the appellant had fraudulently used
    the name Ian Israel Korman on certain loan documents and therefore sought to
    add the name Israel Ian Korman to the judgment.  He did not notice that the bank also sought declarations of fraud.  He therefore said nothing to the appellant concerning
    these declarations or the impact that they would have on him.  Rather, he advised the appellant that,
    because he would suffer no prejudice, he should consent to the motion and avoid
    incurring unnecessary costs.  The
    appellant was never provided with a copy of the motion materials and, based on
    his solicitor’s advice, authorized his solicitor to consent to the bank’s
    motion.  Justice Miller then issued the
    consent order on February 27, 2008.  I
    note that Miller J.’s order amending the judgment added the alias Ian Israel
    Korman and not Israel Ian Korman as requested in the motion.  Nothing in this appeal turns on this apparent
    error.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    April 2008, the appellant made a proposal under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1992, <span class=GramE>c</span>.
    27.  The bank took the position that,
    because its judgment was for money owing in fraud, it would survive the
    bankruptcy.  The appellant then became
    aware of the declarations he had purportedly consented to, as well as the impact
    of the amended judgment.  He then brought
    a motion before Quigley J. pursuant to r. 59.06 seeking to amend or set aside
    the consent order of Miller J. on the bases of error and facts discovered after
    it was made.  He maintained that there
    had been no fraud, fraud had not been pleaded by the bank in the original
    claim, and his consent had been given pursuant to erroneous information
    supplied to him by his solicitor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    support of his motion, the appellant filed an affidavit in which he provided an
    explanation for the alleged misstatements in his personal statement of affairs.  He also pointed out that his personal
    statement of affairs had not been provided to the bank in order to secure a loan
    from the bank.  The debt had been incurred
    by <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> and virtually all of the funds had been advanced
    before the appellant signed the personal guarantee of <span class=SpellE>Futurecom’s</span> obligations.  It followed, therefore,
    that the bank could not have made the advances to <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> in reliance on his personal statement of affairs.  The appellant also filed an affidavit from
    his previous solicitor in which the solicitor confirmed his misunderstanding of
    what had been sought in the motion before Miller J., as well as his failure to advise
    the appellant of the declarations and of the impact of consent to them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    response, the bank filed affidavit evidence explaining the relationship among
    the bank, <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> and the appellant and challenging
    a number of the allegations contained in the appellant’s affidavit.  The bank did not, however, contradict the
    acknowledgment by the appellant’s former solicitor that he had not advised the
    appellant of the impact of the consent.  Nor
    did the bank contradict the appellant’s assertion that most of the funds
    advanced to <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> were unsecured until the
    appellant’s personal guarantee was provided sometime later.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appeal raises three issues:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>1.   Whether
    the motion judge made palpable and overriding factual errors based on a
    misapprehension of the evidence,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>2.   The
    propriety of using r. 59.06 to amend a judgment to obtain relief not sought in
    the moving party’s pleading, and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>3.   Whether
    the appellant’s consent remedies any procedural defects in the order of Miller
    J. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant argues that the motion judge made palpable and overriding errors in
    his factual findings and erred in his interpretation of r. 59.06.  The respondent submits that even if such
    errors were made, the appellant consented to the order of Miller J. and that
    consent cannot now be withdrawn.  I will
    deal with each of these submissions in turn.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>Factual
    Findings</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the appellant had produced no
    credible evidence to support his allegation that the funds had not been obtained
    by fraud and that he had consented to Miller J.’s order based on his solicitor’s
    mistake.  The appellant submits that the
    motion judge misapprehended the evidence in reaching both of these conclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the bank’s reliance on the appellant’s
    representations, the motion judge found that the appellant “opened the accounts
    in October <span class=GramE>2005, that he provided the personal statement of affairs
    at the same time” and “that</span> the bank advanced him $50,000 of overdraft
    funding on the accounts he opened as evidenced in his own bank
    statements”.  He then concluded that the
    advance of funds to the appellant was made by the bank in reliance on his
    personal statement of affairs.  The
    records, however, do not show any advances to the appellant in 2005.  Rather, the advances were originally made by
    way of overdraft to <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> in the October 2005 to
    January 2006 period.  At the time of the
    advances to <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span>, the appellant does not appear
    to have been personally liable for their repayment.  The appellant’s liability did not come about
    until some six months later when, on April 10, 2006, the overdrafts were
    converted to a loan to <span class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> and the appellant
    signed a guarantee of <span class=SpellE>Futurecom’s</span> debt.  It is apparent, therefore, that no funds were
    advanced to the appellant.   When the bank made the original advances to <span
class=SpellE>Futurecom</span> by way of overdraft, it could not have been
    relying on the appellant’s personal statement of affairs as the bank had no
    recourse against the appellant’s personal assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also rejected the appellant’s
    contention that the consent to the motion was based on incorrect or incomplete
    advice from his solicitor.  In doing so,
    he stated that the appellant’s “protestations that the solicitor has admitted
    his mistake are of little value when there is no corroborative evidence before
    the court that would add any reliability or weight to [the appellant’s]
    assertion and his complaint.”  It is apparent,
    however, that the motion judge did not consider the affidavit filed by the
    appellant’s former solicitor in which that solicitor confirmed that he advised
    the appellant to consent, that he did so “under the misunderstanding that the
    bank was simply seeking to add ‘Israel Ian Korman’ to the default judgment”,
    that he had “misunderstood the full nature and scope of the relief the bank
    sought” and that he recommended to the appellant that he consent to the motion
    as he “did not believe that any prejudice would result” to the appellant.  This affidavit, on which the respondent did
    not cross-examine, substantially corroborated the appellant’s position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, therefore, the motion judge erred in finding
    that there was no basis for disputing the bank’s claim that the funds were
    obtained by fraud, and in rejecting the appellant’s submission that he
    consented to Miller J.’s order based on an error committed by his solicitor.  Both these findings were based on a
    misapprehension of the evidence and cannot stand.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submitted to the motion judge and again to
    this court that rule 59.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) allows a party to
    apply, by motion, to set aside or vary a judgment when, after judgment is
    obtained, it is determined that the judgment was <i>procured </i>by fraud.  It was
    not, in the appellant’s submission, intended to apply to convert a judgment otherwise
    obtained into a judgment in fraud, particularly where fraud was not pleaded in
    the statement of claim.  In other words, as
    applicable in this case, a judgment obtained in contract for a debt cannot be
    declared to be in fraud after judgment and absent the appropriate pleadings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge appears to have accepted the proposition
    that the normal course would be for the bank to amend its pleading in order to
    seek a judgment in fraud.  However, he
    ultimately rejected the appellant’s submission finding that “post-judgment, the
    notice of motion contents are allegations in this matter that effectively
    amount to new pleadings – they assert fraud clearly on their face. … I have no
    doubt that it was open to the bank to obtain the order that it did and it was
    open to Miller J. to grant that order, turning the default into a judgment in
    fraud under r. 59.06 based on the after-discovered facts.  That is exactly one of the reasons why the rule
    is there.”  Thus, in the view of the
    motion judge, a motion under r. 59.06 pertaining to a fresh cause of action obviates
    the need to have pleaded the cause of action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge erred in rejecting the
    appellant’s submission in this regard.  Rule
    59.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) allows for the amendment, setting aside or
    varying of orders “on the ground of fraud or of facts arising or discovered after
    it was made.”  There are, therefore, two
    separate and distinct bases for applying r. 59.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a).  The first is fraud.  Read in the context of the rule as a whole, it
    is clear that the reference to fraud is a fraud perpetrated in the way the judgment
    or order was obtained.  There is no
    suggestion that this occurred in the present case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second basis is broader.  It provides that a judgment or order may be amended,
    set aside or varied because of facts that arose or were discovered after the
    order or judgment was obtained. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the respondent argues that the facts
    it relies on to prove the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations were discovered
    by it after the judgment was obtained.  Assuming that the statements in the appellant’s personal statement of affairs
    were indeed fraudulent, the bank submits that this places it within the rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The
    difficulty with the respondent’s position is that it had never claimed fraud in
    the statement of claim.  The claim was
    simply for recovery of a debt based on the guarantee.  The claim contained no allegation of fraud
    nor was declaratory relief of the nature ordered by Miller J. sought.  In my view, this placed the relief requested
    by the bank beyond the scope of that available under r. 59.06.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rule does not contemplate altering a judgment or
    order to provide for relief never sought in the moving party’s pleading.  In order to come within the rule, the motion
    must be one brought “in the proceeding”.  As a general rule, pleadings lay out the four corners of the dispute and
    parties are bound by their pleadings:  See <span class=SpellE><i>Kalkinis</i></span><i> (Litigation Guardian of) v. Allstate
    Insurance Co. of Canada </i>(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.); leave to appeal
    refused, [1999] SCCA No. 253 (S.C.C.).  The proceeding continues to be defined by the pleadings even after
    judgment is obtained.  For the motion to
    be “in the proceeding”, therefore, it must be a motion that, even before
    judgment, was available to the moving party to bring.  In this case, even on a generous reading, a motion
    for judgment declaring the sums to <span class=GramE>be owing</span> in fraud
    could not have been brought or succeeded before judgment based on the pleadings
    as they stand.  Rather, the respondent’s
    pleading would have to have been amended to request such relief.  </p>
  <h3>Does the appellant’s
    consent to the order of Miller J. cure any procedural defects?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bank argues that the appellant’s consent to Miller
    J.’s order cannot now be withdrawn and, in effect, operates so as to waive or
    cure any defects in procedure.  Assuming that
    this court has the discretion to dismiss the appeal on this basis, I do not
    consider this to be an appropriate case for granting such relief and would
    decline to do so.  Given the seriousness
    of the allegation, fraud must normally be pleaded and proved with particularity
    and the defendant ought generally to be entitled to defend.  Here, fraud was neither pleaded nor proved
    and the materials filed raise a serious issue as to whether fraud was involved
    in the advancing of the funds owing to the bank.  Further, it is apparent from the affidavit
    filed by the appellant’s former solicitor that the appellant’s consent was
    based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the relief being sought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that the fact that Mr. Korman
    consented to the order of Miller J. on the basis of mistaken advice from his
    solicitor should preclude him from setting aside the impugned parts of the
    order.  It is neither just nor equitable
    in the circumstances to allow the order to stand and I would set it aside.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the motion judge’s order and
    substitute an order setting aside the declaratory parts of the order of Miller
    J. dated February 27, 2008.  I would
    award the appellant his costs of the appeal, including the costs of the motion
    in this court for security for costs, fixed at $8,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.  I would award no costs of the
    motion that is the subject of the appeal to either party.</span></p>
