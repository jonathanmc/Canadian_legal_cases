  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>I</h3>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a federal civil servant, describes
    himself as a whistle-blower.  He
    maintains that in response to his whistle-blowing activities, his supervisors
    harassed, maligned and otherwise mistreated him.  Counsel for the appellant submits that the
    appellant, as a whistle-blower, is entitled under the controlling jurisprudence
    to proceed against his supervisors and his employer, the federal government, by
    way of a tort claim in the Superior Court rather than through the grievance
    procedures set up for the resolution of workplace disputes in the applicable
    statutes, regulations and collective agreements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents take the position that the claims
    advanced by the appellant do not fall within the whistle-blower category.  Furthermore, they contend that even if the
    appellant is a whistle-blower, the applicable statutory provisions deprive the
    Superior Court of jurisdiction to entertain his claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents moved under Rule 21 for an order
    striking the appellant’s statement of claim, contending that the Superior Court
    had no jurisdiction to entertain the action.  The motion judge agreed, holding that the grievance procedures set out
    in the applicable statutes and collective agreements provided the only forum in
    which the appellant could seek relief for the mistreatment he allegedly
    suffered at the hands of his supervisors and employer.  The motion judge struck the statement of claim.  The appellant appeals from that order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  I agree with the motion judge that s. 236 of
    the <i>Public Service Labour Relations Act</i>,
    S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (the “<i>PSLRA</i>”),
    a provision that had no counterpart in the prior legislation, constitutes an
    explicit ouster of the Superior Court’s jurisdiction over claims like those
    advanced by the appellant.</p>
  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h3>
  <h3>The Factual Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant joined Transport Canada as a marine
    analyst in June 2003.  In November 2004,
    he became acting chief of Marine Regulatory Projects in Transport Canada.  That position was made permanent in March
    2005.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his statement of claim, the appellant alleges that
    shortly after he became acting chief, various employees approached him with
    complaints about the conduct of the respondent, Joanne St-Onge, the Director of
    Regulatory Affairs in Marine Security.  These complaints involved security-related matters, and alleged
    unethical and inappropriate management practices by St-Onge.  The appellant pleads that he took these
    concerns to St-Onge and, shortly thereafter, became the target of retaliatory
    measures by her.  These included
    derogatory comments, exclusion from meetings and St-Onge’s refusal to continue
    to accommodate the appellant’s known and pre-existing physical ailment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further alleges that in 2005 and 2006, he
    unsuccessfully pursued his concerns up the chain of command.  He approached Gerald Frappier, Laureen Kinney
    and Marc Grégoire, the other named respondents.  In July 2006, the appellant filed a harassment grievance, alleging that
    he had been improperly ordered to refrain from pursuing the complaints that
    other employees had made to him.  The
    record is silent as to the result of that grievance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant left Transport Canada for a new position
    with Public Works and Government Services Canada in early December 2006.  He alleges that he left Transport Canada
    because the respondents’ retaliatory actions had poisoned the workplace against
    him.  On or about the same day that the
    appellant moved on to Public Works, he delivered an unsolicited report that he
    had prepared to the Auditor General of Canada and others.  That 51-page report purported to outline
    “shortcomings, misconduct and mismanagement of the marine security portfolio at
    Transport Canada”.  It alleged
    deficiencies both in the regulatory scheme and the managerial approach to
    security matters within the Marine Security Directorate.  The report also set out numerous allegations
    of managerial incompetence and misconduct involving the respondents.  The appellant pleads that after he delivered
    his report further retaliatory steps were taken against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant commenced this action in September
    2007.  According to his statement of
    claim, he has suffered significant emotional, physical and mental distress as a
    result of his treatment in the workplace at Transport Canada.  The appellant seeks declaratory relief and
    damages for intentional infliction of mental distress, negligent infliction of
    mental distress, abuse of statutory power, interference with economic interest,
    defamation and breach of fiduciary duty.  The appellant claims that the respondent, Attorney General of Canada, as
    representative of the federal Crown, is vicariously liable for the actions of
    the named respondents, all of whom work for the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the respondents have very different
    views on the nature of the appellant’s complaints.  The appellant claims that he has acted as a
    whistle-blower throughout this controversy.  He maintains that he has attempted to bring to light matters of genuine
    public concern involving the misuse of public funds, gross mismanagement within
    a government department and the contravention of legislative and regulatory
    schemes designed to promote national security.  He further contends that at least some of the misconduct and harassment
    directed at him was in response to his whistle-blowing.  The appellant places considerable emphasis on
    his December 2006 report.  He submits
    that on any reasonable view, his conduct makes him a whistle-blower:  see <i>Fraser
    v. Public Service Staff Relations Board</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455, at p. 470; <i>Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act</i>,
    S.C. 2005, c. 46, s. 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue that the appellant’s complaints
    are essentially personal in nature and involve interpersonal disputes between
    the appellant and the named respondents.  The respondents contend that the complaints do not have the public-interest
    component necessary to properly characterize them as whistle-blowing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge (at paras. 31-32) agreed with the
    respondents’ interpretation.  While it
    seems to me that there is a whistle-blower flavour to at least some of the
    appellant’s complaints, it is unnecessary to decide whether the motion judge’s
    finding is unreasonable.  On my analysis,
    even assuming that the appellant is properly characterized as a whistle-blower,
    his claim was properly struck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;'><b>III</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><b>The
    Scheme Governing the Terms of the Appellant’s Employment</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Binnie J. observed in <i>Vaughan v. Canada</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 146, at para. 1, the terms and
    conditions<i> </i>of those employed in the
    federal civil service are governed by a comprehensive scheme that includes
    statutes, regulations, collective agreements and other governmental
    directives.  The <i>PSLRA</i> governs the terms and conditions of the appellant’s
    employment after April 1, 2005.  Prior to
    that date, the <i>Public Services Staff
    Relations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 (the “<i>PSSRA</i>”), governed the employer-employee relationship between the
    appellant and the federal government.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Almost all of the relevant events occurred
    after the <i>PSLRA</i> came into force in
    April 2005.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  For the purposes relevant to this appeal, the
    two pieces of legislation are the same, with one significant exception.  In addition to those two statutes and the regulations
    proclaimed under them, the appellant’s employment was governed by two
    collective agreements, one described as “Agreement between the Treasury Board
    and The Public Service Alliance of Canada” (the “PM Agreement”) and the other
    as “Agreement between the Treasury Board and The Social Science Employees
    Association” (the “ES Agreement”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 208 of the <i>PSLRA</i> and s. 91 of the <i>PSSRA</i> provide
    employees with a very broad right to grieve any occurrence or matter affecting
    the terms or conditions of their employment.  Grievances brought under those provisions are heard and determined
    according to the procedures set out in the relevant legislation, regulations
    and terms of the applicable collective agreement.  The grievance process is internal.  Management personnel determine the merits of
    the grievance.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Almost all employment-related disputes can be grieved
    under s. 208 of the <i>PSLRA</i> or s. 91 of
    the <i>PSSRA</i>.  The right of the employee to refer that
    grievance to third-party adjudication, however, is significantly limited in
    both acts.  Section 209 of the <i>PSLRA</i> and s. 92 of the <i>PSSRA</i> set out the limited circumstances
    in which an employee can refer a grievance to independent third-party
    adjudication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The grievance procedures found in the two collective
    agreements mirror those set out in the statutes.  They provide for a three-stage grievance
    process culminating with the decision of the Deputy Head of the Department or
    his or her designate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 214 of the <i>PSLRA</i> and s. 96(3) of the <i>PSSRA</i> indicate
    that in respect of matters subject to the grievance process, that process is
    final.  Section 214 of the <i>PSLRA</i> reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If an individual grievance has been presented up to
    and including the final level in the grievance process and it is not one that
    under section 209 may be referred to adjudication, <i>the decision on the grievance taken at the final level in the grievance
    process is final and binding for all purposes of this Act and no further action
    under this Act may be taken on it.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collective agreements contain similar finality
    clauses.  For example, the PM Agreement
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The decision given by the Employer at the Final
    Level in the grievance procedure shall be final and binding upon the employee
    unless the grievance is a class of grievance that may be referred to
    adjudication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The allegations advanced by the appellant in support of
    his claims in the Superior Court were all matters that he could have grieved
    under the grievance procedures set out in the statutes and the collective
    agreements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this appeal, the important
    distinction between the present legislation, the <i>PSLRA</i>, and its predecessor, the <i>PSSRA</i>,
    lies in the inclusion of s. 236 in the present legislation.  It had no counterpart in the <i>PSSRA</i>.  Section 236 reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) The right
    of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to
    his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action
    that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to
    the dispute.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)
    Subsection (1) applies whether or not the employee avails himself or herself of
    the right to present a grievance in any particular case and whether or not the
    grievance could be referred to adjudication.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span> </span>(3) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect
    of an employee of a separate agency that has not been designated under
    subsection 209(3) if the dispute relates to his or her termination of
    employment for any reason that does not relate to a breach of discipline or
    misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondents contends that, as a result
    of s. 236, the grievance procedure is the exclusive means for the adjudication
    of grievable claims.  He submits that the
    only exception is found in s. 236(3).  That exception, which relates to a termination of employment, clearly
    has no application on the facts of this case.  I will return to s. 236 later in these reasons.  First, I will examine <i>Vaughan</i>, the leading authority on the <i>PSSRA</i>, the legislation in force up to April 2005.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left;'><span>                                                                            </span>IV</h3>
  <h3><i>Vaughan v. Canada</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant relies heavily on the
    reasoning in <i>Vaughan</i>.  He acknowledges that it recognizes that, as a
    general rule, courts should defer to the grievance procedure where the
    complaint in issue can be advanced through that procedure.  He submits, however, that the court
    recognizes a “whistle-blower” exception to that general rule.  Counsel contends that where the nature of the
    complaint is such that the employee cannot expect fair treatment through the
    internal grievance procedure, <i>Vaughan</i> holds that the courts maintain a residual discretion to allow such complaints
    to proceed by way of action in the civil courts.  Counsel submits that the appellant’s
    complaints fall within this category.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Vaughan</i>,
    the employee, a federal civil servant, sued the government in the Federal Court
    claiming that he was entitled under the applicable regulations to certain early
    retirement benefits.  There was no
    suggestion that the employee was a whistle-blower.  However, much like the appellant in this
    case, the employee in <i>Vaughan</i> could
    have advanced his claim for early retirement benefits by way of the internal
    grievance procedure set out in the relevant statutory provisions.  He chose not to do so.  Again, like the appellant, had the employee
    in <i>Vaughan</i> proceeded by way of an
    internal grievance, he could not have gained access through the relevant
    statutory provisions to independent third-party adjudication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The government moved to strike the claim on the basis
    that the employee was obligated to proceed by way of grievance.  The court agreed and the claim was
    struck.  The Supreme Court of Canada
    upheld that ruling.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Binnie J., for the majority, recognized – subject to
    constitutional considerations that were not raised – that a legislature could
    exclude “workplace” disputes from the jurisdiction of the civil courts:  see <i>Weber
    v. Ontario Hydro</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929.  Binnie J. held, however, at para. <span class=GramE>2, that</span> the
    language of the <i>PSSRA</i> could not be
    read as providing for “the explicit ouster of the jurisdiction of the
    courts”.  In Justice Binnie’s view (and
    in that of Bastarache J., for the dissenters), the overall scheme governing
    employment relations in the federal civil service and the language of the <i>PSSRA</i> signalled that, as a general rule,
    the courts should defer to the grievance processes provided for in the statutes
    and the collective agreements while retaining a residual discretion to take
    jurisdiction in appropriate cases: see <i>Vaughan</i>,
    at paras. 32-41 (majority), 57-73 (dissent).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing the circumstances in which the court should
    exercise its residual discretion and permit an action to proceed despite the
    availability of the grievance procedure, Binnie J. referred to the
    “whistle-blower cases”:  <i>Pleau (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</i> (1999), 182 D.L.R. (4th) 373 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal
    to S.C.C. refused, [2000] 2 S.C.R. v; and <i>Guenette
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 601 (C.A.).  In a “whistle-blower” case, the employee
    contends that he or she has been mistreated by management in retaliation for
    disclosures of misconduct or mismanagement made by the employee in the public
    interest.  Binnie J. accepted that in
    this situation, the nature of the complaint could result in a conflict if the
    merits of that complaint were finally decided by a grievance procedure that
    made management personnel the ultimate arbiters of the merits of the
    grievance.  He accepted that if a
    conflict existed, an internal grievance procedure that did not provide for
    independent third-party adjudication may not afford effective redress for the
    employee.  Binnie J. acknowledged that
    where effective redress for a complaint could not be gained through the
    grievance procedures, the courts could exercise their residual discretion and
    permit an action to proceed in the civil courts based on that complaint.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Binnie J. recognized a “whistle-blower” exception to
    the general rule that disputes governed by the <i>PSSRA</i> should proceed through the grievance procedure.  In so doing, he rejected the submission (contrary
    to the dissenting opinion) that the absence of independent third-party
    adjudication necessarily triggered the court’s residual discretion.  Because <i>Vaughan </i>was not a whistle-blower case, Binnie J. did not describe definitively the
    scope of the whistle-blower exception.  However,
    his reasons indicate that the absence of third-party adjudication would justify
    judicial intervention only where the facts disclosed “a more particular and
    individualized conflict problem (as in the whistle-blower cases)”:  <i>Vaughan</i>,
    at para. 37.</p>
  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>V</h3>
  <h3>Section 236 of the <i>PSLRA</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The holding in <i>Vaughan</i> that the Superior Court retained a residual discretion to entertain a claim
    based on a grievable complaint turned on the language of the <i>PSSRA</i>, the legislation in force at the
    relevant time.  The appellant’s reliance
    on <i>Vaughan</i> assumes that the change in
    the statutory landscape, and particularly the enactment of s. 236 of the <i>PSLRA</i>, does not affect the basic holding
    in <i>Vaughan</i>.  I think it does.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament can, subject to constitutional limitations that
    are not raised here, confer exclusive jurisdiction to determine certain
    disputes on a forum other than the courts.  It will take clear language to achieve that result:  <i>Pleau</i>,
    at p. 381.  Section 236 is clear and
    unequivocal.  Subject to the exception
    identified in s. 236(3), which has no application here, s. 236(1) declares that
    the right granted under the legislation to grieve any work related dispute is
    “in lieu of any right of action” that the employee may have in respect of the
    same matter.  Section 236(2) expressly
    declares that the exclusivity of the grievance process identified in s. 236(1)
    operates whether or not the employee actually presents a grievance and “whether
    or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication”.  The result of the language used in ss. 236(1)
    and (2) is that a court no longer has any residual discretion to entertain a
    claim that is otherwise grievable under the legislation on the basis of an
    employee’s inability to access third-party adjudication:  see <i>Van
    Duyvenbode v. Canada</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 2716 (S.C.), at para. 17, aff’d
    without reference to this point, 2009 ONCA 11; <i>Hagal v. Canada</i>, [2009] F.C.J. No. 417 (T.D.), at para. 26, aff’d
    without reference to this point, 2009 FCA 364.  While the residual discretion may exist if the grievance process could
    not provide an appropriate remedy, there is no suggestion in this case that it
    could not:  see <i>Vaughan</i>, at para. 30.  Assuming that to be the case, disputes that are grievable under the
    legislation must be determined using the grievance procedure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant attempts to limit s. 236 by arguing that
    it was intended to apply only to “routine”, “garden variety” or “run of the
    mill” employment grievances, but not to whistle-blower complaints.  There is nothing in the language of s. 236 to
    support this limitation.  To the
    contrary, Parliament has identified in s. 236(3) the one and only exception to
    the general language used in ss. 236(1) and (2).  That exception has nothing to do with whistle-blowing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant next argues that an
    interpretation of s. 236 that excludes access to the court denies purported
    whistle-blowers a fair and independent process to adjudicate complaints that
    may arise should their whistle-blowing result in reprisals from their
    employers.  This, the appellant argues,
    will discourage legitimate whistle-blowing.  There may be merit to this contention.  It is, however, a policy argument.  At best, it might assist in the interpretive process if the statutory
    language were in any way unclear or ambiguous.  Given the clear language of s. 236, I do not think that this argument
    can help the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argues that a superior court
    must maintain an inherent jurisdiction despite whatever language may be used in
    s. 236.  He relies on <i>Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees
    Canadian Pacific System Federation v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.</i>, [1996] 2
    S.C.R. 495, at para. 8.  As I read that
    case, it stands for the proposition that a superior court has inherent
    jurisdiction to provide a remedy where the relevant statutory scheme does not
    speak to the circumstances at hand.  In
    other words, the court’s inherent jurisdiction can fill remedial lacunae in
    legislation.  There is no legislative gap
    here.  Section 236 speaks directly to
    workplace complaints that are grievable under the legislation.  For those complaints, even when there is no
    access to third-party adjudication, the grievance procedure operates “in lieu
    of any right of action”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the motion judge (at para. 36), I am satisfied
    that s. 236 of the <i>PSLRA</i> explicitly
    ousts the jurisdiction of the court over claims that could be the subject of a
    grievance under s. 208 of that Act.  On
    my review of the appellant’s claim, there are no allegations of misconduct by
    the respondents that predate April 1, 2005, the date on which the <i>PSLRA</i> became the operative legislation.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  Section 236 applies to the entirety of the
    conduct underlying the appellant’s claims.  The motion judge properly held that the section excludes the claims from
    the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.<a

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  The parties may make written submissions as
    to costs.  Those submissions shall not
    exceed four pages each.  The respondents’
    submissions shall be filed within 14 days of the release of these reasons.  The appellant will have seven days to reply
    to the respondents’ submissions.</p>

    the court retains a residual discretion under the <i>PSLRA</i> to entertain litigation of a grievable matter, resort to that
    discretion requires that the court be satisfied that the grievance process does
    not provide an avenue of suitable redress for the employee’s compliant:  see <i>Vaughan</i>,
    at paras. 25, 30, 33-41.  Whether the
    appellant was in fact deprived of access to independent third-party
    adjudication is arguable.  The appellant
    may have been able to access such adjudication through Treasury Board policy
    operative at the time he launched his grievance (see Treasury Board of Canada
    Secretariat, <i>Policy on the Internal
    Disclosure of Information Concerning Wrongdoing in the Workplace</i> (N.p.:
    Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, 2004)); through the independent adjudicative
    process to address whistle-blower complaints provided in the <i>Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act</i>,
    which came into force in April 2007; or pursuant to an agreement contained in a
    letter from the responsible Minister that was appended to one of the collective
    agreements that applied to the appellant.  However, the applicability of the Treasury Board policy was not
    raised.  Nor was the applicability of the <i>Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act</i> to events that pre-dated its proclamation addressed by the parties.  <span class=GramE>Finally, the relevance, if
    any, of the agreement in the Minister’s letter was not raised before the motion
    judge and was disputed by the appellant in oral argument.</span>  None of these issues must be addressed to
    decide this appeal.  As none was explored
    in any detail, I think it is best to leave them for another day.  </p>
