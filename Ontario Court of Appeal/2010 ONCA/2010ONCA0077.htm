  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Over 15 years ago, the Attorney General of
    Ontario sought and a judge granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting
    anti-abortion protest activity at various places in Ontario, including the
    Scott Clinic in Toronto.  Among the
    activity enjoined was the display of signs within sixty feet of the Clinic
    property.  Among the persons named in the
    injunction was Linda Gross, now known as Linda <span class=GramE>Gibbons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      On October 8, 2008, the interlocutory
    injunction remained in force.  On that
    day, Linda Gibbons displayed a sign within sixty feet of the Scott Clinic
    property.  She was charged with
    disobeying a court order under s. 127(1) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>that provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>127. (1) Disobeying order of court – <span
class=SpellE>Every one</span> who, without lawful excuse, disobeys a lawful
    order made by a court of justice or by a person or body of persons authorized
    by any Act to make or give the order, other than an order for the payment of
    money, is, unless a punishment or other mode of proceeding is expressly
    provided by law, guilty of</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       <span
class=GramE>an</span> indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term
    not exceeding two years; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       <span
class=GramE>an</span> offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The principal issue here is whether Ms.
    Gibbons’ conduct falls within or beyond the reach of s. 127(1) because another
    “punishment or other mode of proceeding is expressly provided by law” for her
    conduct, under the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure </i>(“the <i>Rules</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      In my view, for the reasons that I will
    develop, the conduct alleged falls within the sweep of the offence created by
    s. 127(1) and is not excluded from its operation by the availability of a
    proceeding for contempt in accordance with the <i>Rules</i>.  Although I would
    grant Ms. Gibbons (“the appellant”) leave to appeal on this ground, I would
    dismiss her appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Trial
    Proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    prosecutor elected to proceed by summary conviction.  Counsel entered a plea of not guilty on
    behalf of the appellant, <span class=GramE>then</span> applied to quash the
    information on the ground that s. 127(1) was inapplicable to the conduct
    alleged against the appellant because the <i>Rules</i> expressly provided for another mode of proceeding to punish the same conduct, a
    motion for a contempt order.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    trial judge quashed the information.  He
    reasoned that since the appellant’s alleged conduct was disobedience of a civil
    order, the appropriate enforcement mechanism was a motion for a contempt order
    under the <i>Rules</i>.  He considered that the <i>Rules</i>, in particular rules 60.11 and 60.12, were “a punishment or
    other mode of proceeding … expressly provided by law”, within the exception in
    s. 127(1), thus rendering the section inapplicable to the appellant’s alleged
    conduct.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Summary Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    prosecutor appealed the order quashing the information laid against the
    appellant, in all likelihood under s. 830(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>: see <i>R. v.
    Moore</i> (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 471 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 474-75.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    summary conviction appeal court judge (the SCAC judge) allowed the appeal, set
    aside the order quashing the information and ordered a new trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    SCAC judge determined that rules<i> </i>60.11
    and 60.12 do not amount to “a punishment or other mode of proceeding …
    expressly provided by law” within the exception of s. 127(1).  The SCAC judge concluded that, despite the
    inclusion of greater detail in the <i>Rules</i> governing motions for contempt orders than had been the case when <i>R. v. Clement</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 468, was
    decided, the decision in <i>Clement</i> remained controlling.  The <i>Rules </i>did not expressly provide a
    punishment or other mode of proceeding.  The exception in s. 127(1) did not apply.  The appellant’s conduct was governed by s.
    127(1), not beyond its reach.  She
    ordered a new trial.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal under s. 839(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of
    the <i>Criminal Code </i>from the decision
    of the SCAC judge.  The question of law
    the appellant seeks leave to argue involves the interpretation of the exception
    in s. 127(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> captured in the words “a punishment or other mode of proceeding … expressly
    provided by law”.  To be more specific,
    the appellant contends that rules<i> </i>60.11
    and 60.12 expressly provide a punishment or other mode of proceeding to coerce
    compliance with (or punish disobedience of) the interlocutory injunction, thus
    render s. 127(1) inapplicable and warrant an order quashing the information.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant also seeks leave to argue that, if s. 127(1) does apply to the
    appellant’s alleged conduct, the proceedings against her should be stayed as an
    abuse of process.  The appellant filed an
    application to stay proceedings at trial, but advanced no argument on the issue
    at trial or before the SCAC judge.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    First Ground: The Applicability of s. 127(1)</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>                        <b>The Positions of the Parties</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the appellant, Mr. Santoro submits that under <i>Clement</i> the term “law” means statute law,
    both federal and provincial.  The <i><span lang=EN-US>Rules </span></i><span lang=EN-US>are
    regulations made under s. 66 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  Thus the <i>Rules </i>are “law” for
    the purposes of the exception in s. 127(1).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that rules 60.11 and 60.12 are
    specific and comprehensive provisions that authorize and govern proceedings to
    obtain a contempt order, not simply an expression of the common law power.  These <span lang=EN-US>rules put in place, along with more general rules relating to motions, a
    comprehensive scheme for enforcement of civil orders, like injunctions.  Rules<i> </i>60.11
    and 60.12, expressly provide an “other mode of proceeding” to ensure
    enforcement of civil orders like the injunction in this case.  In the result, the appellant says, rules<i> </i>60.11 and 60.12 <span class=GramE>fall</span> within the exception in s. 127(1), thus exclude the application of the
    prohibition contained in that section to the allegations made here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Santoro characterizes his position as consistent
    with the underlying purpose of s. 127, that is to acknowledge that the primary
    enforcement agency for court orders (made in civil cases) is not the blunt
    instrument of the criminal law, but rather the processes of the court that made
    the order a party seeks to enforce.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the respondent, Ms. Magotiaux offers no objection
    to leave being granted on the interpretation of the exception contained in s.
    127(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The issue raised transcends the specific
    circumstances of this case, involves a question of statutory interpretation,
    and is of general importance to the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Magotiaux contends that the <i><span lang=EN-US>Rules</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, in particular rules<i> </i>60.11 and 60.12, do <i>not</i> expressly provide a “punishment or
    other mode of proceeding” for disobeying a court order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent says that these rules<span lang=EN-US> formulate the practice to be followed to
    invoke the inherent power of the Superior Court to punish for contempt of its
    orders.  But they do not create the legal
    foundation for contempt as a mode for proceeding to enforce judicial
    orders.  The foundation authority is the
    common law.  Without the rules, the court
    retains the power to punish contempt.  And a common law jurisdiction is not “expressly provided by law” as <i>Clement</i> in s. 127(1) requires to render
    the subsection inapplicable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    Magotiaux reminds that <i>Clement</i> requires a comprehensive mode of proceeding or punishment.  To come within the exception requires a
    provision that furnishes express and specific means to enforce an order.  Procedural rules of general application are
    inadequate.  Despite their greater
    detail, rules 60.11 and 60.12 do not remove <i>Clement</i> as the controlling precedent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Magotiaux</span> submits that
    her interpretation of the exception in s. 127(1) sits comfortably with the
    purpose that underlies the section.  The
    public interest requires a criminal law response to breaches of court orders,
    civil as well as criminal. The appellant’s interpretation would neuter s. 127
    as a device to compel obedience to civil orders, thereby rendering of no effect
    the holding in <i>Clement</i> that the
    section applies to all court orders, whether made in civil or criminal
    proceedings.  Parliament intended that
    the exception be narrow, not so expansive as to reduce by half what the prohibition
    takes in.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Offence in s. 127(1)</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 127(1) began life as an indictable offence in
    s. 139 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> of
    1892.  It came from s. 115 of the <i>English Draft Code</i> where the “other mode
    of proceeding” had not only to be “expressly provided by law”, but also to be
    “intended to be exclusive of all other punishment for such disobedience”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its material parts, s. 127(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=SpellE>Every
    one</span> who, without lawful excuse, disobeys a lawful order made by a court
    of justice … other than an order for the payment of money, is, unless a
    punishment or other mode of proceeding is expressly provided by law, guilty of</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nub of the offence in s. 127(1) is disobedience of
    a lawful order made by a court of justice or other authorized person or body of
    persons.  The order must not be for the
    payment of money.  The person charged
    with disobedience can escape liability if she or he had a lawful excuse for
    disobeying the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the subsection, for that matter in any
    related provision of the <i>Corruption and
    Disobedience</i> subdivision of Part IV, <i>Offences <span class=GramE>Against</span> the Administration of Law and Justice</i>,
    apart from the words “other than an order for the payment of money”, restricts
    or limits the nature of the order or of the proceedings in which the order may
    be granted.  The words “lawful order made
    by a court of justice” <span class=GramE>include</span> orders made in both
    civil and criminal proceedings: <i>Clement</i> at p. 472.  Thus, leaving aside for the
    moment the effect of the exception, “unless a punishment or other mode of
    proceeding is expressly provided by law”, disobedience of an injunction by a
    person bound by it, in the absence of a lawful excuse, would fall within the
    prohibition of s. 127(1) and attract liability under it.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Exception in s. 127(1)</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    127(1) creates a criminal offence.  But
    it also creates an exception for certain conduct that would otherwise attract
    liability. To be <span class=GramE>excepted</span> from the prohibition, the
    conduct must be subject to a “punishment or other mode of proceeding …
    expressly provided by law”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
    is advanced here as a “punishment or other mode of proceeding … expressly
    provided by law”  to render the criminal
    prohibition enacted by s. 127(1) inapplicable is the authority of the Superior
    Court to punish those who disobey court orders for contempt.  It is well established that s. 127(1) does <i>not</i> supersede the power of a court of
    justice to punish summarily for contempt committed in the face of the court: <i>In re Gerson</i>, [1946] S.C.R. 547,
    affirming [1946] S.C.R. 538, at pp. 544-45.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    determine whether the authority to punish for contempt of a court order meets
    the requirements of the exception in s. 127(1), it is essential to determine
    the source of the contempt power.  Section 9 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> refers to the power, jurisdiction and authority of “a court, judge, justice or
    provincial court judge … to impose punishment for contempt of court.”  A Superior Court has the inherent power to
    control its own processes and to enforce its judgments by citation for contempt.  The third potential source, relied upon here,
    is the <i>Rules </i>promulgated under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    9 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> contains no
    enactment of the contempt power, rather preserves the existing common law
    jurisdiction to punish for criminal contempt: <i>Clement</i> at pp. 473-74.  In a
    similar way, the inherent power of the Superior Court to control its own
    process, more specifically to enforce its judgments by citation for contempt,
    equally rooted in the common law, affords no <i>express </i>authority for a “punishment or other mode of proceeding”.  In the result, neither meets the “expressly
    provided by law” requirement of the exception in s. 127(1): <i>Clement</i> at pp. 475-76.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    decision of the <span class=GramE><i>Clement</i></span><i> </i>court limits the phrase “by law” in the
    exception in s. 127(1) to statute law: <i>Clement</i> at p. 476-77.  It is only statute law
    that can be “expressly provided”: <i>Clement</i> at p. 476-77.  The common law, ever
    evolving and malleable, does not <i>expressly</i> provide a mode of proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 127(1) is available as a basis for a charge for
    disobedience of a lawful court order whenever statute law, including
    regulations made under an enabling statute, does <i>not</i> expressly provide a punishment or other mode of proceeding, but
    not otherwise: <i>Clement</i> at p. 477.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To say that the phrase “by law” in the exception in s.
    127(1) is restricted to statute law is of little value without further
    definition.  Federal statutes only?
    Federal statutes and regulations exclusively? Provincial statutes as well?
    Provincial statutes and regulations too?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it does not provide a clear, crisp demarcation
    of the scope of the term “by law” in s. 127(1) and its own equivalent, “by
    statute law”, the <i>Clement</i> court did
    offer some assistance in determining the meaning to be assigned to the phrase.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Clement</i>,
    as here, the legal foundation advanced for the inapplicability of the section,
    the “expressly provided by law” of the exception, were the rules of court
    promulgated under a provincial statute.  In other words, the appellant invoked regulations promulgated under a
    provincial statute as the basis upon which s. 127(1) was said to be
    inapplicable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not fail in <i>Clement</i> because the authority he invoked was a provincial
    regulation.  The appellant failed in <i>Clement</i> because the regulation did not
    provide the legal foundation for contempt proceedings, only preserved the
    common law inherent power in much the same way as s. 9 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>: <i>Clement </i>at p. 475.  Since the
    common law did not satisfy the “expressly provided by law” requirement of the
    exception, the prohibition remained applicable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later authorities have considered provincial
    legislation as engaging the exception in s. 127(1) and rendering the offence
    created by this section inapplicable to conduct captured by the provincial
    legislation: see e.g. <i>R. v. Dawson</i> (1995),
    100 C.C.C. (3d) 123 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 132; <i>R.
    v. Nutter</i> (1999), 173 N.S.R. (2d) 284 (C.A.), at paras. 3-4<span
class=GramE>.  Other</span> provincial
    appellate courts have considered various rules of civil procedure as a
    “punishment or other mode of proceeding … expressly provided by law”.  In two instances, the courts have reached the
    same conclusion as in <i>Clement</i>, that
    the applicable rules do not engage the exception: <i>R. v. Fairchuk </i>(2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 503 (Man. C.A.)        <span class=GramE>at</span> paras. 34-35,
    leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (2003), 178 C.C.C. (3d) vi (<span
class=GramE>S.C.C .</span>); <i>R. v. Rent</i> (1989), 91 N.S.R. (2d) 112 (S.C. (A.D.)).  In <i>R. v. <span class=GramE>Gaudreault <span style='font-style:normal'> (</span></span></i>1995),
    105 C.C.C. (3d) 270, at p. 276, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that Articles
    49-51 of the <i>Code of Civil Procedure </i>enacted
    by the National Assembly of Quebec fell within the terms “expressly provided by
    law” in s. 127(1), thus rendered the <i>Code</i> provision inapplicable in a prosecution for breaching a non-communication term
    in a family law order.</p>

    equally resides in the common law: the authority of the Superior Court to

    Second Ground: Abuse of Process</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant filed a notice of application at trial to
    stay proceedings for abuse of process.  She invoked s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter </i>in aid of the application, but filed no material beyond the notice, a
    factum and a book of authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant proceeded first with her
    application to quash the information because s. 127(1) did not apply to the
    conduct alleged in the information.  When
    the trial judge quashed the information, the appellant made no submissions on
    her application to stay proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not advance any argument about abuse
    of process in response to the prosecutor’s summary conviction appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After filing her notice of appeal from the decision of
    the SCAC judge, the appellant applied to a single judge of this court for leave
    to raise the abuse of process argument on appeal.  The single judge referred the leave
    application to the panel hearing the appellant’s appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant says that leave to appeal should be granted.  The record below is complete.  No evidence is required to determine the
    issue.  The facts are
    uncontroverted.  An interlocutory
    injunction granted in 1994 to a plaintiff, the Attorney General of Ontario, who
    was bound to pursue the claim for a permanent injunction, but never did.  The same official, 14 years later, prosecutes
    the appellant for disobeying the injunction.  No contempt proceedings initiated.  The inference of an abuse of process is irresistible from these primary
    facts.  A stay of proceedings is the
    appropriate remedy.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent resists the application for leave to appeal on this ground.  The point was never argued at trial <span
class=GramE>nor</span> on summary conviction appeal.  All the facts necessary to determine the
    issue are not in the record.  Singular by
    its absence is any evidence about the conduct of the Crown. When the interests
    of both parties are balanced, it would not be unjust not to deal with this
    issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
    Magotiaux takes the further position that the claim of abuse of process is
    without merit.  At its core, the
    appellant’s claim is a thinly-veiled collateral attack on the validity of an
    interlocutory injunction granted 15 years ago.  Collateral attacks are off-limits, themselves little less than an abuse
    of process.  Injunctions are dissolved by
    process of law, not disobedience of their terms.  The claim lacks an air of reality.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Leave Requirement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 839(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> the appellant requires
    leave to appeal from the decision of the summary conviction appeal court.  The proposed ground of appeal must involve a
    question of law alone.  Leave to appeal
    under s. 839(1)(a) is to be granted sparingly, all the more so where the
    proposed ground of appeal was not raised or argued before the summary
    conviction appeal court and raised but not argued at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two factors are influential in the exercise of
    discretion involved in the determination of whether leave to appeal should be
    granted under s. 839(1)(a):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          the significance, beyond the
    particular case, of the proposed question of
    law to the general administration of justice; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         <span class=GramE>the</span> merits of
    the proposed ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other principles are also at work in the determination
    of whether the appellant should be permitted to <span class=GramE>raise</span> as a ground of appeal before a second level appellate court a ground not
    previously argued.  To raise a new issue
    on appeal requires a sufficient evidentiary record to permit determination of
    the issue.  The issue must not be one
    that the appellant failed to raise at trial for tactical reasons.  And the appellate court must be satisfied
    that no miscarriage of justice will result from refusal to permit the new issue
    to be raised on appeal: <i>R. v. Brown</i>,
    [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918, at p. 927.</p>
  <h4>Abuse of Process</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An abuse of process may be established where the
    proceedings are oppressive or vexatious and violate the fundamental principles
    of justice underlying the community’s sense of fair play and decency: <i>R. v. Scott</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p.
    1007; <i>R. v. Regan</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A stay of proceedings is only one remedy for an abuse
    of process, albeit the most drastic remedy.  Regardless of whether the abuse causes prejudice to an accused, because
    of an unfair trial, or to the integrity of a justice system, a stay of
    proceedings is only appropriate when:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          the prejudice caused by the alleged
    abuse will be manifested,            perpetuated
    or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its    outcome; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         <span class=GramE>no</span> other
    remedy is reasonably capable of removing the prejudice.</p>
