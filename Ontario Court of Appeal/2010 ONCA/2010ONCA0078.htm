  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant/moving party Robert Monteith seeks an
    order granting an extension of time to February 19, 2010 to perfect his appeal
    from the orders of Tausendfreund J. dated August 11, 2009 and October 21, 2009.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a judgment dated August 11, 2009, Tausendfreund J.
    ordered the removal of Robert Monteith as an estate trustee of the estate of
    George Monteith and ordered the continuation of Donald Monteith as the sole
    estate trustee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 10, 2009, the appellant filed a Notice of
    Appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 21, 2009, Tausendfreund J. made a costs
    order of $35,000 in favour of the respondent.  The appellant appealed that order as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 26, 2009, the registrar sent a notice of
    intent to dismiss for delay (NIDD) to the appellant, setting November 17, 2009,
    as the deadline to perfect his appeal.  On November 18, 2009, when the appellant was informed of the perfection
    deadline in person, he informed the registrar that he did not receive the NIDD because
    his mail was being forwarded to Montreal.  The registrar allowed the appellant until November 27, 2009, to either
    perfect his appeal or serve and file his motion to extend.  At no time did the registrar actually dismiss
    the appeal for delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      On November 25, 2009, the registrar
    received the appellant’s notice of motion for an order granting an extension of
    time to perfect the appeal, dated November 20, 2009, and served on the
    respondent’s counsel on November 23, 2009.  Under the heading “Grounds for the Motion”, the appellant explained and
    requested as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. Notice of the impending deadline of November 17,
    2009, (dated October 26, 2009), was sent to the wrong address, and never
    received.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. An active effort to retain counsel to perfect
    the Appeal has so far not been successful, and a vigorous search for legal
    assistance in this regard continues.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. As 2 months of interviews has as yet proved
    fruitless, I request that no date for the deadline be assigned, as firstly
    counsel must be retained, then time spent on research and preparation of the documents
    to perfect the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. As soon as counsel is retained, we will advise
    the Court, and propose a date for completion of perfecting the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 11, 2010, the appellant retained J. Waldo
    Baerg as his counsel and Mr. Baerg filed a Supplementary Notice of Motion
    requesting an order extending the time to perfect the appeal to a specific
    date, namely February 19, 2010.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUE</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue on the appeal is whether an order should
    be made extending the time to perfect the appeal to February 19, 2010.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>Preliminary
    point</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that in his motion the appellant
    has not sought to set aside the registrar’s order dismissing the appeal for
    delay.  As the respondent asserts,
    “[u]nless this Order is set aside, the relief requested by the appellant is
    meaningless.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fact, the registrar never dismissed the appeal for
    failure to perfect.  In keeping with the
    registrar’s usual protocol, the registrar allowed some leeway for the appellant
    to perfect his appeal after the deadline on November 17, 2009, rather than
    dismiss the appeal as a matter of course.  On November 18, 2009, the appellant informed the registrar that he did
    not receive their notice of the impending deadline.  In light of this, the registrar allowed the
    appellant ten extra days to file his motion to extend.  The appellant filed his motion ahead of the
    deadline.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    merits</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the test for extending the time for
    perfecting an appeal should be similar to the test for extending the time for
    filing a notice of appeal.  In <i>Rizzi v. Mavros</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 401
    (C.A.) at para. 16, Gillese J.A. listed five factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) whether the … appellant formed an intention to
    appeal within the relevant period;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) the length of the delay and explanation for the
    delay;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) any prejudice to the respondent;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) the merits of the appeal; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) whether the “justice of the case” requires it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first of these factors is not relevant on this
    motion because the appellant filed his Notice of Appeal in a timely fashion.  Accordingly, I will consider the other four
    factors from <i>Rizzi v. Mavros.</i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (a) <u>The
    length of delay and explanation for it</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant proposes a perfection date of February
    19, 2010, which is slightly more than a month after he retained counsel and
    three months after the registrar put him on notice about his appeal.  The reason for this delay, apparent form the
    record, and in particular from the appellant’s original Notice of Motion
    prepared by himself, is that he was having difficulty retaining a lawyer.  He has now succeeded on this front and his
    counsel has moved with dispatch and proposes, through the suggested perfection
    date of February 19, 2010, to continue to do so.  In these circumstances, the delay in
    perfection will be relatively brief and the explanation for the delay strikes
    me as reasonable.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) <u>Prejudice
    to the respondent</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delay in court proceedings always encompasses some
    prejudice.  In this case, the settlement
    of an estate will be delayed.  However,
    the respondent does not assert any specific prejudice if the motion is
    granted.  The delay is brief.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (c) <u>The
    merits of the appeal</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has not provided any evidence or argument
    about the merits of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the original Notice of Appeal, prepared by the
    appellant himself, the following is found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL are as follows: No notice was received prior to the
    hearing by the appellant from either Gunn &amp; Associates or Ledroit-Becket
    therefore impeding preparation of a suitable defence for this action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the formal Judgement of Tausendfreund J.
    records, <i>inter alia</i>, “hearing the
    submissions of … the self-represented Respondent”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, I note that the appellant has not provided
    the reasons, if any, of Tausendfreund J. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This factor tells in favour of the respondent.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (d) <u>The
    “justice of the case”</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a sense, this is an ‘umbrella’ factor, requiring the
    motion judge to step back, balance the preceding factors, and consider any
    other factor that might be relevant in the particular circumstances of the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the appellant was self-represented in the
    early stages of his appeal.  He filed a
    timely Notice of Appeal.  When he did not
    follow through and perfect his appeal in compliance with the rules and
    discovered that his appeal was in danger of being dismissed for delay, he moved
    quickly with this motion.  Importantly,
    he has now retained counsel.  This
    counsel has moved with dispatch; he did not seek an adjournment of the motion
    even though it was scheduled only four days after his retainer, he responded to
    it, and he proposes an early date, February 19, 2010, for perfection of the
    appeal.  In these circumstances, the
    balancing of the factors and the “justice of the case” point towards a
    disposition that permits the appeal to be heard on the merits sometime this
    spring.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion is granted.  The appellant is given to February 19, 2010 to perfect his appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks his costs of the motion on the
    basis that the respondent unreasonably withheld his consent to a motion reasonably
    brought.  I disagree.  This is a close call.  I have, in effect, granted the appellant an
    indulgence so that the appeal can be heard and determined on the merits.  Accordingly, each party should bear its own
    costs.</p>
