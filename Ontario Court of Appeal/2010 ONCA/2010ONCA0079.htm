  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the order of Perkins J.
    dated September 4, 2009 dismissing its action, on a motion for summary
    judgment, in a commercial lease case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the landlord was not
    entitled to terminate the lease because no rent was owing at the relevant time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    landlord’s notice letter dated March 4,  2008 called on the tenant to “restore the
    security deposit to its original amount”.  There is no question that the tenant’s security deposit was deficient on
    that date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the landlord did not provide
    proper notice of default under the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  To the extent, if at all, that the tenant had
    to be alerted to the possibility that termination was a potential outcome, we
    agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that the landlord’s March 4, 2008
    letter to the tenant was sufficient notice under s. 19(2) of the <i>Commercial Tenancies Act</i>.  In our view, there is no ambiguity in the
    words in the letter “the landlord will move to protect its interests to the
    fullest extent of the Lease and law.”  In
    a commercial lease context, these words point clearly to potential recourse by
    the landlord to the very remedies contemplated by the lease, namely, in this
    case, termination of the lease and/or re-entry into and repossession of the
    leased premises.  As expressed by the
    motion judge: “[Cornell] was formally notified of its default and given a
    deadline to correct it.  If Cornell did
    not comply, it acted at its peril.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the post-termination
    agreement whereby the tenant was able to remove its property from the leased
    premises and accepted $5000, and wherein both parties agreed that they would
    have “no further liability or claim of any nature whatsoever against the other”
    was invalid because it was unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We observe, as a preliminary matter, that, strictly
    speaking, this issue is only relevant if the appellant was successful on at
    least one of its first two grounds of appeal.  It has not been; accordingly, the landlord does not need to rely on the
    post-termination agreement to resist this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, for the sake of completeness, we state that we
    do not accept the appellant’s unconscionability argument.  In <i>Birch
    v. Union of Taxation Employees, Local 70030</i>, 2008 ONCA 809, at para. 45,
    Armstrong J.A. said that “a determination of unconscionability involves a
    two-part analysis – a finding of inequality of bargaining power and a finding
    that the terms of an agreement have a high degree of unfairness”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no inequality of bargaining power in this
    case for several reasons, including the fact that both parties were commercial
    entities operating under the terms of a negotiated lease, and the principal of
    the appellant knew the legal consequences of defaulting on a lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no unfairness in the post-termination
    agreement.  The appellant sought
    compensation, accepted $5000 and immediately cashed the certified cheque.  Not until ten months later, and long after a
    new tenant had commenced its business in the premises, did the tenant attempt to
    resile from its agreement.  In these
    circumstances, fairness would suggest enforcing the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled to their costs
    of the appeal which we fix at $7500 for Sarvom and $4500 for Somana inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
