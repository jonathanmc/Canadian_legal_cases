  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from her conviction for fraud
    over $5000 and seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed of three years'
    imprisonment.  The offence involved a
    fraud against the appellant’s employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;The appellant raises four issues on her
    conviction appeal. &nbsp;</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         Adverse
    witness ruling</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought and obtained a ruling that the
    appellant’s daughter was an adverse witness and proceeded to cross-examine her.
     The appellant submits that the Crown’s
    application was without foundation and that the trial judge erred in the manner
    in which he conducted the application.  We
    agree that the manner in which this application was handled was problematic for
    a variety of reasons.  However, we are
    not persuaded that what followed gave rise to any significant prejudice to the
    appellant.  The ensuing cross-examination
    consisted of no more than about 15 questions.  Many of those questions were not, in fact,
    cross-examination and the answers given to those that were cross-examination did
    not materially advance the Crown's case.  We do not accept the appellant’s
    characterization of what happened as an illegitimate manoeuvre by the Crown to
    discredit the appellant's daughter and to tar the appellant with the same
    brush.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         Improper
    cross-examination by the Crown</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the Crown's cross-examination
    was improper for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant was contradicted with the
    statement she had made to her probation officer and no <span class=SpellE><i>voir</i></span><i> dire</i> was held to assess the voluntariness or admissibility of that
    statement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  The statement in question was made to the
    probation officer for the purpose of preparing a pre-sentence report for
    another case involving the appellant.  Defence
    trial counsel did not ask for a <span class=SpellE><i>voir</i></span><i> dire</i> and did
    not object to the cross-examination.  The
    questions concerning the appellant's statements to the probation officer were
    not controversial and the appellant did not dispute their truth.  While, as conceded by the Crown, it is certainly
    preferable to canvass the issue of voluntariness prior to embarking on such a
    cross-examination, we fail to see how, in light of all the circumstances, the
    appellant has suffered any prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant alleges that the trial Crown made
    many demeaning or sarcastic remarks during the appellant's cross-examination.  Again, while taken in isolation, some of the
    trial Crown's remarks were unfortunate, when the cross-examination is
    considered in the context of this trial as a <span class=GramE>whole,</span> we
    see nothing in what happened that rises to the level of having rendered the
    trial unfair.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         <i>Corbett</i> ruling</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has a criminal record which includes
    several convictions for crimes of dishonesty.  The appellant brought a <i>Corbett</i> application prior to testifying and her trial counsel asked
    that the entire record be excluded.  The
    trial judge rejected that submission and ruled that the appellant’s criminal
    record was relevant to her credibility.  On
    appeal, the appellant submits that her record should have been edited and that
    the last conviction for theft in 2003 should have been expunged.  We disagree.  The theft conviction had a direct bearing upon
    the honesty of the appellant and although it involved theft from an employer,
    the background to the conviction was not advanced before the jury.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>4.         Failure to
    vet jury observations&nbsp;</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the appellant testified at trial, the Crown
    disclosed to defence counsel the record of the appellant’s driver’s licence
    suspension ten years earlier.  The
    appellant admitted in chief that she regularly drove but denied any knowledge
    of the suspension of her license.  She
    was cross-examined as to her knowledge of the suspension.  After this evidence had been given, the trial
    judge received notes from two jurors indicating that they had observed someone
    they thought to be the appellant driving out of the courthouse parking lot.  When this was brought to the attention of
    counsel, <span class=SpellE>defense</span> counsel moved for a mistrial.  The trial judge refused to declare a mistrial
    and simply thanked the jurors for their notes and proceeded with the trial.  In both his opening instructions to the jury
    and in his charge, the trial judge gave the standard instruction that the jury
    were to determine the case solely on the basis of the evidence led in court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge erred by failing to conduct an inquiry to ensure that the jury remained impartial
    and that it would decide the case solely on the basis of the evidence presented
    in court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it may have been preferable had the trial judge
    explored any concerns the jury might have had arising from the observations
    they had made, we are not persuaded that his failure to do so amounted to an
    error in law in the circumstances of this case.  As the appellant had admitted that she
    regularly drove an automobile before the jury members made their observations,
    there was no significance to the information the jury members gleaned.  Furthermore, the note did not ask for any
    assistance.  The jurors were simply
    reporting their observation.  In these
    circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the jury members
    were simply acting out of an abundance of caution and that his instructions would
    provide an adequate safeguard.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion: cumulative effect</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have indicated, the manner in which this trial
    was conducted was far from a model of perfection.  However, whether considered individually or
    cumulatively, we are simply not persuaded that any of the shortcomings we have
    discussed resulted in an unfair trial.  We
    agree with the respondent Crown’s submission that the appellant faced a
    formidable prosecution case that clearly implicated her as having perpetrated a
    significant fraud upon her employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Sentence appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal her sentence of
    three years’ incarceration.  We are not
    persuaded that the sentence was outside the range or that the trial judge
    committed any error of principle.  This
    was a serious fraud on the appellant’s employer involving approximately
    $50,000.  Given the appellant’s record
    for crimes of dishonesty, including one prior breach of trust theft, the fact
    that the appellant was on probation at the time she committed the offense in
    question and the devastating effect the crime had upon the victim, the sentence
    was not unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal sentence but
    dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
