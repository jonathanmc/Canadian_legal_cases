  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, the Corporation of the Town of
    Orangeville (“Orangeville”), appeals the order of the application judge which
    dismissed its application for a judicial determination of the rights of Robert
    Adams, Mayor of Orangeville, and Warren <span class=SpellE>Maycock</span>,
    Deputy Mayor of Orangeville, to participate in certain discussions and votes of
    the Council of the Corporation of the County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> (“<span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council”).  The discussions related to the proposed sale by <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County of the former CP Rail Line Land Corridor that extends roughly from
    Orangeville to Owen Sound.  The appellant
    sought a declaration that Adams and <span class=SpellE>Maycock</span> were not
    precluded from participating in the discussions and votes pursuant to the <i>Municipal Conflicts of Interest Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.50 (<i>MCIA</i>).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orangeville appeals the application judge’s
    determination that Adams and <span class=SpellE>Maycock</span> were in a
    conflict of interest because the interests of Orangeville were imputed to them
    and Orangeville had a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the vote before <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council.  The application judge also found that this interest did not fall within
    the exceptions created by the <i>MCIA</i>.  Orangeville also appeals the application
    judge’s decision to award costs against it on the application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> is an
    upper-tier municipality made up of several lower-tier municipalities including
    Orangeville.  Pursuant to s. 6(1) of the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> </i>Act, S.O. 1994, Pr. 13, <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council is
    composed of the mayor and deputy mayor, or mayor and reeve, of each of the
    County’s constituent municipalities.  Adams and <span class=SpellE>Maycock</span>, as Mayor and Deputy Mayor
    of Orangeville, are therefore <i>ex officio </i>members
    of the Council.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2008, Orangeville entered into an agreement
    with a third party for the sale of railway lands.  The agreement provides that Orangeville will
    receive $5,000,000 for the land and an additional $2,000,000 conditional on the
    northward expansion of the line.  The
    sale however, is conditional on <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> selling
    railway lands it owns to the same buyer.  The agreement also stipulates that Orangeville will take all actions
    within its control and make best efforts to ensure the buyer’s acquisition of <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin’s</span> railway lands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a dispute at <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council, Orangeville brought an application pursuant to r. 14.05(3<span
class=GramE>)(</span>d) for a judicial determination that Adams and <span
class=SpellE>Maycock</span> were not precluded from participating in the
    Council’s deliberations over the sale of the railway lands because of a
    conflict of interest arising from Orangeville’s contract with the potential
    buyer.  <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> opposed the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that, as Mayor and Deputy
    Mayor of Orangeville, Adams and <span class=SpellE>Maycock</span> had an
    indirect pecuniary interest in the outcome of the decision by <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council.  She found that, for the purposes of s.2 (a<span class=GramE>)(</span>iii)
    of the <i>MCIA</i>, Adams and <span
class=SpellE>Maycock</span> were members of a “body” (Orangeville) with a direct
    pecuniary interest in the matter before <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council.  Therefore, pursuant to s. 5 of
    the <i>MCIA</i>, they were precluded from
    taking part in discussions and votes on the matter.  The application judge rejected the
    appellant’s submission that any such interest would be exempt from s. 5 as “an
    interest in common with electors generally” pursuant to s. 4(j).  She noted the unusual circumstances in which
    the conflict arose, finding that Adams and <span class=SpellE>Maycock</span> were arguably contractually obligated to vote in favour of the sale of land,
    and could not be expected to prefer the interests of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> to those of Orangeville. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a preliminary matter, the respondent argues that
    this court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  It submits that s. 11 of the <i>MCIA</i> limits rights of appeal and
    provides that any right of appeal lies to the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Should the court find that it has jurisdiction, we
    are to consider the question posed in the original <span class=SpellE>applicaiton</span>:  <span lang=EN-US>Where a member of a lower-tier municipal council is <i>ex officio</i> also a member of the upper-tier municipal council, is
    that member precluded from taking part in discussions or voting on a question
    in respect of a matter before the upper-tier council, by reason only of the
    lower-tier municipality’s pecuniary interest in the matter?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In my
    view, the answer to this question will turn on the answer to the following question:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>1)    Does
    the court have jurisdiction to hear the appeal?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of the jurisdiction of the court to hear the
    appeal turns on the relationship between s. 11 of the <i>MCIA</i> and s. 6(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C-43.  Those provisions read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11.  An appeal lies from any order made under
    section 10 to the Divisional Court in accordance with the rules of court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6(1) <span class=GramE>An</span> appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>...</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) a final order of a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice, except an order referred to in clause 19(1)(a) or an order
    from which an appeal lies to the Divisional Court under another Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent maintains that the appeal should be
    dismissed on the basis that this court has no jurisdiction.  The respondent explains that the <i><span lang=EN-US>MCIA</span></i><span lang=EN-US> </span>stipulates that only orders made
    pursuant to s. 10 of the Act can be appealed and that any such appeal lies to
    the Divisional Court and not the Court of Appeal.  Because the proceeding was brought by way a
    rule 14.05(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) application for a judicial
    determination, the order was not one made pursuant to <i>MCIA</i> and, therefore, the decision is not one made pursuant to s. 10
    and no appeal of the application judge’s order is possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject this submission.  The order under appeal was one made by the
    Superior Court pursuant to <span class=GramE>a</span> r. 14.05
    application.  The respondent does not
    challenge the propriety of the matter having been brought before the courts in
    that manner.  Pursuant to s. 6 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, an appeal from
    the decision of a Superior Court judge lies to the Court of Appeal unless a
    different appeal route is specified in a statute.  As acknowledged by the respondent, the
    application was not made pursuant to the <i>MCIA</i>.  None of the various types of relief provided
    for under s. 10 were claimed.  The fact
    that the determination required the Superior Court to interpret various
    sections of the <i>MCIA</i> does not render
    it an order made under s. 10.  The order
    made was a final order of a Superior Court judge and, pursuant to s. 6(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act,</i> an appeal from that order lies with this court.</p>
  <h3>2) When
    considering the potential conflict of an ex officio member of an upper-tier
    municipality is a lower-tier municipality a “body” for the purposes of s. 2(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>iii) of the Act?<u></u></h3>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>a)        Upper- and Lower-Tier Municipalities</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is an upper-tier municipality, which is
    defined as “a municipality of which two or more lower-tier municipalities form
    part for municipal purposes” (<i>Municipal
    Act, 2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 25, s. 1(1)).  In <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County, the Town of Orangeville
    and each of the seven other local municipalities are lower-tier municipalities
    meaning “a municipality that forms part of an upper-tier municipality for
    municipal purposes.” (<i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>,
    s. 1(1)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County was created
    by the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Act, 1994</i>.  That Act establishes the
    composition of County Council and allocates the votes of its members.  The County Council is composed of the mayors
    and deputy mayor of six of its eight component local municipalities and the
    mayors of the other two local municipalities. Each member municipality has a
    share of the vote that is proportional to the percentage of the population of
    the county represented by that municipality.  Under the formula established under the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Act</i>, the Town of
    Orangeville holds 13 of the possible 30 votes at County Council.  The mayor and deputy mayor of the Town of
    Orangeville are <i>ex officio</i> members of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council.  Their vote is weighted so as to reflect the percentage of <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> electors that the Town of Orangeville represents (<i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, ss. 4(1) and
    6(1)).  The mayor and deputy mayor are,
    in essence, taken to be elected by those <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> electors located in the Town of Orangeville.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County and the
    Town of Orangeville were created by the province to be responsible and
    accountable governments with respect to matters within their jurisdiction.  Each is given powers and duties under the <i>Municipal Act, 2001 </i>for the purpose of
    providing government with respect to those matters.  The allocation of jurisdiction as between the <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County and its local municipalities is
    established, principally, by ss. 8 and 11 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001.</i>  Specifically, the provisions of s. 11, including its Table, establish
    the formula for the division and exercise of powers as between the councils at
    the two levels in the two tier municipal structure.  (<i>Municipal
    Act, 2001, </i>ss. 8 to 9, and 11).  Some
    of the powers are exclusive to the lower-tier municipality, others are
    exclusive to the upper-tier municipality and still others are non-exclusive
    with both tiers having power to pass by-laws with respect to these matters.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>b)        Position of the
    parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “body” used in s. 2(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>iii)
    of the <i>MCIA </i>is not defined in the
    Act.  The <span class=GramE>respondent
    submits that “body” should be given a broad interpretation and include</span> a
    lower-tier municipal corporation.  As a
    result, inserting the relevant facts of this case, s. 2(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>iii)
    would provide that the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Orangeville, as members of <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council, have an indirect pecuniary interest in
    any matter before <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council if the Town of
    Orangeville has a pecuniary interest in the matter.  The application judge agreed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent acknowledges that this interpretation
    might result in representatives of lower-tier municipalities occasionally
    finding themselves in conflict because of the lower-tier municipality’s
    pecuniary interest in a matter before the upper-tier municipality.  In the respondent’s submission, however,
    these situations will be relatively infrequent.  The respondent argues that the pecuniary interest in this case is
    unique.  Furthermore, many situations
    where a pecuniary interest exists will come within one or other of the exceptions
    listed in s. 4 of the <i>MCIA</i>.  Specifically, it was submitted that a pecuniary
    interest of the lower-tier municipality will frequently be one that is in
    common with the electors of the upper-tier municipality generally (s. 4(j)), or
    will be so remote or insignificant in its nature that it cannot reasonably be
    regarded as likely to influence the member (s. 4(k)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the interpretation proposed
    by the respondent is inconsistent with the structure and purpose of upper- and
    lower-tier municipalities created by the legislature.  This structure creates a significant overlap
    in the areas of jurisdiction.  There will
    be many instances where a lower-tier municipality’s interest in a matter before
    the upper-tier municipality will be pecuniary in nature.  The legislature could not have intended that
    members of the component lower-tier municipalities would have imputed to them
    the pecuniary interest of the municipality they represent. If that were so, elected
    representatives would be prevented from participating in discussions of or
    voting on issues important to their electors whenever the lower-tier
    municipality on whose council they sit had a pecuniary interest in the matter
    being considered by the upper-tier municipality.  The issue in the present case, like many
    issues in which the Town of Orangeville has a pecuniary interest, is important
    to the electors of Orangeville.  They
    should not be effectively disenfranchised simply because their representatives
    on <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council are, by virtue of the <span
class=SpellE><i>Dufferin</i></span><i> County Act</i>, <i>ex officio</i> members selected from among members of the Council of
    Orangeville rather than representatives elected directly by them.<i> </i></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>c)         Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The courts have held that the <i>MCIA</i> is to be construed broadly and consistently with its
    purpose.  It was enacted to encourage
    open, accountable and honest municipal government by demanding “high standards
    of those elected to public office”:  <i>Re: Moll and Fischer et al. </i>(1979), 23
    O.R. (2d) 609 (Div. <span class=SpellE>Crt</span>.), at 612.  In that context, courts have held that what
    constitutes a pecuniary interest sufficient to trigger the provisions of the <i>MCIA</i> is not to be narrowly confined:  <i>Re:  Edwards and Wilson et al., </i>[1980] O.J.
    No. 3873 (Div. <span class=SpellE>Crt</span>.), at para. 20. There is no
    exhaustive guideline for its determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, “body” is not defined in the <i>MCIA</i>.  In keeping with the purpose and intent of the Act, the term should be
    given a broad interpretation, to ensure that all potential conflicts of
    interest are captured by it.  However, it
    must also be noted that the<i> MCIA</i> is
    part of a broader legislative scheme that includes the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, and, in the present case, the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Act</i>.  These statutes will be relevant
    in interpreting the provisions of the <i>MCIA</i>:  Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed.
    (Markham:  LexisNexis, 2008) at 413; <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service
    Alliance of Canada,</i> [1991] 1 S.C.R. 614 at 531-532.<u>  </u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that s. 15 of the <i>MCIA</i> provides that “in the event of conflict between any provision
    of this Act and any provision of any general or special Act, the provision of
    this Act prevails”.  That section,
    however, has no application to the present case as I do not view the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i> and the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Act</i> as conflicting with the<i> MCIA</i>.  They simply assist in interpreting what is to
    be included in the term “body” as that expression is used in s. 2(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>iii) of the <i>MCIA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the term “body” must take its meaning from
    the context and scheme of the <i>MCIA</i> as
    well as the scheme of upper- and lower-tier municipalities created by the
    legislature.  The legislature has chosen
    to have lower-tier councillors sit on upper-tier municipal councils because
    they were elected to, and participate in the decisions of, lower-tier municipal
    councils.  This leaves them well placed
    to understand and represent the interests of the lower-tier municipality and to
    coordinate the activities of both tiers.  If they were prevented from discussing and voting on matters of interest
    to both tiers simply because the lower-tier had a pecuniary interest in the
    matter, they would be prevented from doing the job they were elected to do and
    that the legislature intended.  This
    would be inconsistent with the provisions of the <span class=SpellE><i>Dufferin</i></span><i> Act</i> as well as s. 8(1) of the <i>Municipal
    Act, 2001</i>, which provides that the powers of a municipality must be
    interpreted broadly in order to, “enable the municipality to govern its affairs
    as it considers appropriate and to enhance the municipality’s ability to
    respond to municipal issues.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, read harmoniously with the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Act </i>and<i> </i>the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i> and in a manner consistent with the upper- and
    lower-tier structures, the <i>MCIA</i> should
    not be taken as imputing a pecuniary interest of a lower-tier municipality to
    its <i>ex officio</i> representatives on an
    upper-tier municipal council.  In other
    words, where the “council or local board” referred to in s. 2 is an upper-tier
    municipal council, the term “body” as used in ss. 2(a)(iii) should be read as
    excluding the lower-tier municipality of which the member in question is an <i>ex officio </i>representative.  To interpret otherwise would make the
    operation of upper-tier municipal councils unwieldy and would not be in
    accordance with the structure created pursuant to the <i>County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Act</i> whereby the Mayor
    and Deputy Mayor of Orangeville are made <i>ex
    officio </i>members of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council in order to
    represent the interests of Orangeville electors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion I should not be taken to
    suggest that in discharging their function as <i>ex officio</i> members of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council,
    the Orangeville representatives do not owe a duty to act in the interests of <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County.  They do.  However, they cannot be
    said to violate their duty to <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County simply
    because they also represent the interests of Orangeville.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, the respondent argues that the contrary
    interpretation, adopted by the application judge, would not have the negative
    consequences outlined above.  Specifically, it was argued that conflicts such as that in the present
    case will be rare and that the majority of such conflicts will fall within the
    exceptions set out in s. 4 of the <i>MCIA</i> as being either shared by the electors of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County generally (s. 4(j)) or being so remote or insignificant that they cannot
    reasonably be regarded as likely to influence the member (s. 4(k)).  I turn now to these arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pecuniary interest at issue in the present case is
    clear and significant.  The Town of
    Orangeville stands to gain $5 to $7 million dollars depending on how the matter
    is decided by <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council.  As noted by the application judge, the type
    of conflict that arose in this case is rare and “there is no evidence of any
    other instance where one of the local municipalities of the County of <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> has executed an agreement, the final fulfillment
    of which can be so significantly affected by the County of <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> entering into a separate legal agreement for the sale of land which it owns.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I agree that pecuniary interests that are as
    clear and significant as exist in the present case will be infrequent, the
    pecuniary interests addressed by the <i>MCIA</i> are not only those that are clear and very significant but all pecuniary
    interests, unless of course they fall within one of the exceptions listed in s.
    4.  I do not, therefore, agree that the
    interpretation advanced by the respondent and accepted by the application judge
    will only rarely have an impact on the work of upper-tier municipalities.  What constitutes a pecuniary interest is not
    to be narrowly confined or limited to clear and very significant pecuniary
    interests.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the breadth and variety of matters that are
    placed under the jurisdiction of upper-tier municipalities pursuant to the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, one can well imagine
    many decisions taken by an upper-tier municipality in which one or more of its
    constituent lower-tier municipalities will have a pecuniary interest.  For example, decisions on the placement or
    operation of regional facilities such as parks, sewage or solid waste treatment
    facilities may well impact the operating costs as well as property values, and
    thus tax revenues, of the lower-tier municipalities.  In these circumstances, they would therefore
    have a direct pecuniary interest in the results of those decisions.  The representatives of lower-tier
    municipalities should not be disqualified from discussing and voting on such decisions
    simply because the municipalities they represent have a pecuniary interest in
    the result.  To do so would frustrate one
    of the central purposes of the <i>Municipal
    Act, 2001</i> - ensuring that the interests of lower-tier municipalities are
    represented on upper-tier municipal councils.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, I cannot agree that the interests of a
    single lower-tier municipality are likely to be shared by the electors of the
    upper-tier municipality generally, and therefore fall within the scope of s.
    4(j) of the <i>MCIA</i>.  Rather, as in the present case, it is likely
    that many decisions will impact only one lower-tier municipality or will have
    an impact on one that is significantly different than the impact on the others.  For example, adopting the budget of <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County will impact each constituent municipality
    in various ways.  Some of the benefits
    and burdens flowing from the budget to the lower-tier municipalities will be
    pecuniary.  The interests of one
    lower-tier municipality will not necessarily be shared by the others and may
    well be in direct conflict.  On the
    respondent’s reading of the <i>MCIA</i>,
    representatives of such a lower-tier municipality would be precluded from
    speaking to or voting on the budget in these circumstances.  I do not, therefore, consider that the
    exception provided in s. 4(j) is an answer to the concerns raised by the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, I find the application of s. 4(k) to be an
    incomplete response to the concerns expressed by the appellant.  The appellant has argued that the
    interpretation advanced by the respondent would lead to the electors of
    Orangeville being disenfranchised whenever the municipality had a direct pecuniary
    interest in matters before <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> County
    Council.  The application of s. 4(k)
    would only loosen this restriction slightly.  It would allow Orangeville’s representatives to vote and participate in
    discussions, but only where Orangeville’s pecuniary interest in the matter was
    so remote or insignificant that it could not reasonably be regarded as
    influencing the votes of its representatives.  However, it is precisely in cases where Orangeville does have a
    significant pecuniary interest in a matter before <span class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council that it is most important that the electors of Orangeville be
    represented.  In other words, the
    application of s. 4(k) does not avoid the anomalous result that where
    Orangeville has a significant pecuniary interest in a matter before <span
class=SpellE>Dufferin</span> Council, its Mayor and Deputy Mayor, appointed to
    represent its interests, will be unable to do so.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    order<i> </i>of the application judge and
    substitute an order granting the relief sought in <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. <span class=GramE>c</span>, d and e of the Notice of Application.  In my view, this case raises novel issues of
    interpretation of the <i>MCIA</i> and is a
    matter of public interest.  As a result,
    I would make no order as to costs.</p>
