    courts should assume jurisdiction over out-of-province defendants.  Both cases involve claims for personal injury
    damages occasioned as a result of accidents suffered by Canadian tourists at
    resorts in Cuba.  In both matters, the motion
    judges found that Ontario should assume jurisdiction against the out-of-province
    defendants.  When the cases were first
    argued, the appellants did not challenge the test for assumed jurisdiction laid
    down by this court in the “<span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> quintet”: <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span><i> v. <span
class=SpellE>Courcelles</span></i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.); <span
class=SpellE><i>Leufkens</i></span><i> v. Alba Tours International Inc</i>.
    (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 84 (C.A.); <span class=SpellE><i>Lemmex</i></span><i> v. Bernard</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 54 (C.A.); <i>Sinclair
    v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 76 (C.A.); <span
class=SpellE><i>Gajraj</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>DeBernardo</span></i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 68 (C.A.).  The
    court subsequently directed that a five judge panel be established to permit us
    to reconsider the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test.  On the re-argument, the
    appellants, supported by one intervener, submitted that we should essentially
    abandon the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test in favour of an approach based on the Uniform Law Conference model <i>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer
    Act (“CJPTA</i>”) and refuse jurisdiction.  The respondents, supported by another intervener, essentially supported
    retention of a modified <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test, and submitted that they satisfy the appropriate jurisdictional standard. </p>

    Breda and Victor Berg, who had lived in Toronto since September 2002, travelled
    from Toronto for a one-week stay at the <span class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> Breezes <span class=SpellE>Jibacoa</span> resort (the “resort”) in Cuba.  The trip had been arranged by Berg, a
    professional squash player, through the appellant Rene Denis who, from his home
    in Ottawa, operated a web-based business under the name Sport au Soleil.  Denis arranged bookings for squash, tennis,
    and aerobics instructors who agreed to instruct at certain Caribbean resorts
    for a few hours each day in exchange for accommodation for two people at the
    resort.  Denis had an arrangement with
    CRL to find instructors for CRL resorts.  Berg and Van Breda selected the resort from
    those indicated as being available on Sport au Soleil’s website and by looking
    at the websites of the various resorts and <span class=SpellE>SuperClub</span> brochures obtained from travel agents in Ontario. </p>

    his own airfare and that of his common law spouse Van Breda.  After making the arrangements with Denis, Berg
    received a letter from Denis on letterhead bearing the words “<span
class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> Cuba – Tennis” confirming the dates, providing
    information on what to do upon arrival at the airport, and outlining Berg’s
    role as a tennis instructor for two one-hour sessions per day at times to be
    determined by the resort, in exchange for accommodation with a guest in a
    shared room, including all meals and drinks and transportation to and from the
    hotel. </p>

    Van Breda went to the beach, where Berg did some chin-ups using a tubular metal
    apparatus, variously described as a chin-up bar and a soccer goal.  When Van Breda attempted to do chin-ups, the
    apparatus collapsed, sending her to the ground and collapsing on top of her.  Van Breda was seriously injured as a result.  She was rendered a paraplegic, has undergone
    extensive treatment and has suffered serious complications.  Because of the injury, Van Breda and Berg did
    not return to Ontario as they had intended.  Shortly after her fall, Van Breda was taken to
    Calgary, Alberta, the home of her family.  She and Berg have since moved to British

    2006 for personal injury damages, punitive damages and damages for loss of
    support, care, guidance and companionship pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c.F.1</span>.  The fresh as amended statement of claim (the
    “statement of claim”) names as defendants Denis, Sport du Soleil, <span

    Limited, both controlled by <span class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> International.
     The owner of the resort is a Cuban
    corporation not named as a party to this action.  Pursuant to a detailed agreement with the
    Cuban owner, CRL was solely responsible for the operation and management of the
    resort, the training and management of the staff, and for advertising and
    promoting the resort in international markets. </p>

    OF THE MOTION JUDGES</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%;'>I.     <span class=SpellE>Charron</span></span></h4>
  <h3>1)        Real and
    Substantial Connection</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Noting the guiding principles of order and
    fairness, set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hunt v. T&amp;N PLC</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, the motion judge applied
    the eight factor <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test to determine whether there was a real and substantial connection between
    the action and Ontario that could justify the assumption of jurisdiction by the
    Ontario courts.</p>
  <h3><i>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)        The connection between Ontario and the
    plaintiff’s claim</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge noted that Anna <span
class=SpellE>Charron</span> resides in Ontario and that her damages for loss of
    love, care, guidance and companionship pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act</i> and damages for loss of future income continue in
    Ontario.  Claude <span class=SpellE>Charron</span> saw the advertisement for the resort in Ontario, and <span class=SpellE>Bel</span> Air booked the vacation through <span class=SpellE>Hola</span> Sun, an Ontario
    company which had an agreement with CRL to promote the resort to Ontario
    residents.  The motion judge concluded
    that it could be reasonably argued that a contract was entered into in Ontario
    not only for the vacation, but also for the constituent parts, including scuba
    diving.  This factor weighed in favour of
    Ontario assuming jurisdiction.</p>
  <h3><i>(ii)       The connection between Ontario and the defendants</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge noted that Cuban resorts rely
    heavily on international markets and that Canada, and Ontario in particular,
    provides a large portion of the tourists purchasing vacation packages.  CRL manages Cuban resorts and has a legal
    obligation to market them internationally.  <span class=SpellE>Hola</span> Sun, in turn, advertises these resorts in
    Ontario and uses the <span class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> trademarks to do
    so.  The motion judge found that through
    the marketing agreement with <span class=SpellE>Hola</span> Sun, CRL has a
    connection to Ontario.</p>
  <h3><i>(iii)     Unfairness to the defendant in assuming jurisdiction</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that any unfairness to
    the foreign defendants must be balanced against the unfairness to the
    plaintiffs.  Some witnesses for the
    defence may have to come from Cuba, and travel or immigration restraints may
    make this difficult or impossible.  However, alternative arrangements for obtaining evidence could be
    arranged.  On the other hand, the
    plaintiffs and the other Ontario residents have a number of witnesses in
    Ontario.  The motion judge noted that
    insurance is a factor <span class=GramE>mitigating</span> against unfairness to
    the defendant.</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i>(iv)                  Unfairness</i></span><i> to the plaintiff in not assuming jurisdiction</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge noted that if the trial were to
    proceed in Cuba, the plaintiffs and their witnesses, as well as the Ontario
    defendants, would be required to travel there.  The expert evidence indicated the availability of a fair trial in Cuba,
    but the plaintiffs would not have a <i>Family
    Law Act</i>-type claim there.  Anna <span
class=SpellE>Charron’s</span> claim for damages for pain and suffering would
    also be hampered.</p>
  <h3><i>(v)        Involvement of other parties to the suit</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both <span class=SpellE>Hola</span> Sun and <span
class=SpellE>Bel</span> Air are Ontario corporations who defended the action
    and brought cross-claims.  They oppose the
    motion of the foreign defendants.  The
    motion judge held that their involvement favoured assuming jurisdiction and
    distinguished this case from <span class=SpellE><i>Leufkens</i></span> and <span class=SpellE><i>Lemmex</i></span>,<i> </i>where the
    court found that Ontario lacked jurisdiction, on the basis that in those cases
    the harm suffered did not result from activities covered by a contract made in
    Ontario but rather as a result of services purchased in the foreign
    jurisdiction.</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i>(vi)      The</i></span><i> court’s willingness to recognize and enforce
    a similar judgment against a domestic defendant rendered on the same
    jurisdictional basis</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that since CRL advertised
    extensively in Ontario through the <span class=SpellE>Hola</span> Sun
    agreement, marketing to and soliciting Ontario residents to travel to their
    resort in Cuba, it would be unfair to assert that it has no connection to
    Ontario and wash its hands of the jurisdiction.</p>
  <h3><i>(vii)     Whether the case is international or
    interprovincial in nature</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge noted that as this case is
    international in nature, assumed jurisdiction is more difficult to justify.</p>
  <h3><i>(viii)   Comity and the standards of jurisdiction,
    recognition and enforcement prevailing elsewhere</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge stated that there are no Cuban
    treaties, conventions or other such agreements providing for reciprocal
    enforcement of judgments with Ontario, and that Cuba does not provide for any
    type of claim comparable to an Ontario <i>Family
    Law Act</i> claim for loss of care, guidance and companionship.  The motion judge also noted that CRL and Village
    Resorts International Ltd. are not Cuban companies and that if the plaintiffs
    were forced to litigate there, they would have to take further steps to have
    the judgment enforced in the Cayman Islands.</p>
  <h3><i>(ix) Conclusion: real and substantial connection</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge concluded that the defendant Village
    Resorts Limited was a mere licensor of trademarks and that there is no real and
    substantial connection.  The action
    against Village Resorts International Ltd. was dismissed.  With respect to CRL, the motion judge found
    that Ontario does have jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>
  <h3>2)        Forum Non <span
class=SpellE>Conveniens</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge noted the ongoing damages in
    Ontario, the location of witnesses in Ontario and Cuba, the availability of
    experts on Cuban law, and the fact that the foreign corporations are not
    domiciled in Cuba though they argued for a trial there.  Most significant was the lack of a <i>Family Law Act</i>-type claim if the matter
    were to proceed in Cuba.  Having regard
    to these factors, the motion judge concluded that Ontario is clearly the most
    appropriate forum for the dispute.</p>
  <h3>3)        Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, the motion judge dismissed the
    action against Village Resorts International Ltd. but refused to dismiss or
    stay the action against CRL. </p>

    Substantial Connection</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge cited and applied the eight
    factor <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test to determine whether there was a real and substantial connection between
    the action and Ontario to justify the assumption of jurisdiction by the Ontario
    courts. </p>
  <h3><i>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)        The connection between Ontario and the
    plaintiff’s claim</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that, based on the
    statement of claim, there was an arguable case that the plaintiffs’ agreement
    to attend the resort was entered into in Ontario and that Denis was acting “in
    part at least” as Club Resort’s agent for the purpose of arranging their visit
    to the resort.  As the plaintiffs did not
    return to Ontario, no damage was suffered in Ontario, although in
    cross-examination Van Breda testified that had the accident not occurred, they
    would have returned to and remained in Ontario.  The motion judge concluded that despite the
    fact that the plaintiffs had ceased to be Ontario residents and had suffered no
    damage in Ontario, there was a good arguable case that the agreement was
    entered into in Ontario, and that this established “a significant connection
    between the plaintiffs claim and Ontario”.</p>
  <h3><i>(ii)       The connection between Ontario and the defendants</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that there was no
    evidence that <span class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> International had any
    involvement in or connection to Ontario.  Likewise there was no evidence that Village
    Resorts Limited had any direct interest in the resort or that it was involved
    in any aspect of its management or operations.  However, CRL had entered into various
    agreements with Ontario tour operators and CRL had the arrangement with Denis.
    While he did not consider the tour operator agreements to be sufficient to
    constitute a significant connection with Ontario, the motion judge found that CRL’s
    arrangement with Denis in actively seeking professional instructors in Ontario
    and the contract it entered with Berg through Denis constituted “a significant
    connection between CRL and Ontario in connection with the claim being advanced
    by the plaintiffs, giving rise to a strong basis for assuming jurisdiction
    against it”.</p>
  <h3><i>(iii)     Unfairness to the defendant in assuming jurisdiction</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge gave little weight to the
    submission that the assumption of jurisdiction by Ontario would be unfair to
    the defendants.  The <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> quintet recognized the
    unfairness in Ontario assuming jurisdiction against <span class=GramE>foreign service</span> providers in the tourism industry who confine their activities to their home
    jurisdiction.  However, by entering into
    its arrangement with Denis, CRL had not confined its activities to Cuba. The
    motion judge found that the difficulties the defendants would face in having
    witnesses testify in Ontario were not insurmountable.  Moreover, the fact that the defendants had
    obtained liability insurance to protect them if sued in other jurisdictions
    indicated that they were aware that their activities could involve them in
    lawsuits in foreign jurisdictions, including Canada.</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i>(iv)      Unfairness</i></span><i> to the plaintiff in not assuming
    jurisdiction</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that while no other
    Canadian jurisdiction was available to the plaintiffs, they could sue in Cuba
    provided they joined the Cuban company that owned the resort.  However, the motion judge expressed the
    concern that the communist regime in Cuba may exercise undue control over the
    judicial system, thereby creating uncertainty with respect to the fairness of
    the Cuban legal system.  The motion judge
    concluded that “the balance of fairness debate tips in favour of the
    plaintiff”.</p>
  <h3><i>(v)       Involvement of other parties to the suit</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    plaintiffs’ action was the claim against the foreign defendants, the
    involvement of Denis and Sport au Soleil did not strengthen the case for
    assumed jurisdiction against the foreign defendants.</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i>(vi)      The</i></span><i> court’s willingness to recognize and enforce

    the motion judge found that the assumption of jurisdiction would not set a
    standard that did not already exist in Ontario and elsewhere.</p>
  <h3><i>(vii)     Whether the case is international or interprovincial in nature</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    recognition and enforcement prevailing elsewhere</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    relevant foreign jurisdiction and, accordingly, the judge gave no weight to
    this factor.</p>
  <h3><i>(ix)      Conclusion: real and substantial connection </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    favoured Ontario assuming jurisdiction against CRL given its connection with
    Ontario and the subject matter of the action, but that jurisdiction should not
    be assumed against the other two foreign defendants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    motion judge’s finding that as they were resident in Ontario and had been
    served in Ontario, the real and substantial connection test did not apply and
    the court had jurisdiction over them. </p>

    regarding what witnesses would be called and what issues would be litigated.   The
    motion judge concluded that it could not be said that Cuba was clearly a more

    determining when jurisdiction should be assumed against an extra-provincial
    defendant in such cases, in light of the significant changes brought about by <i>Moran
    v. Pyle National (Canada) Ltd</i>., [1975] 1 S.C.R. 393, and  a series of seminal judgments that rewrote the
    law of jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments. </p>

    1077, and <i>Hunt </i>laid down, for the first time, a common law test for
    assumed jurisdiction and enforcement of foreign judgments based on the idea of
    “real and substantial connection” and respect for the principles of “order and
    fairness”.  The reach of provincial
    jurisdiction against extra-provincial defendants was limited to cases that met
    the “real and substantial connection” test, and also required the courts of one
    province to recognize and enforce judgments of another province where the
    jurisdiction asserted by that other province satisfied the real and substantial
    connection test.  In <i>Beals v. <span class=SpellE>Saldhana</span></i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416,
    the Supreme Court held that the real and substantial connection test also
    applied to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  <span class=SpellE><i>Tolofson</i></span><i> v. Jensen; Lucas (Litigation Guardian of) v. Gagnon</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022,

    36-37, in these cases, the Supreme
    Court of Canada described the real and substantial connection test in
    deliberately general language to allow for flexibility in its application.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Tolofson</i></span>,
    at p. 1049, the Court described a real and substantial connection as “a term
    not yet fully defined”. <span> </span>In <i>Hunt</i>, at p. 325, the Court observed
    that <span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span> had not defined “[t]he exact
    limits of what constitutes a reasonable assumption of jurisdiction” and added
    that “no test can perhaps ever be rigidly applied” as “no court has ever been
    able to anticipate” all the possible circumstances. &nbsp;The Court added that
    the real and substantial connection test “was not meant to be a rigid test, but
    was simply intended to capture the idea that there must be some limits on the
    claims to jurisdiction” and that “the assumption of and the discretion not to
    exercise jurisdiction must ultimately be guided by the requirements of order
    and fairness, not a mechanical counting of contacts or connections”.&nbsp; To

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The
    flexibility of the approach used to determine jurisdiction is reflected in the
    unanimous decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>,
    which identifies the factors which ought to be considered...These factors are not strictly concerned
    with the connection of the forum to the parties and the cause of action.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It
    is apparent from <span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span>, <i>Hunt</i> and
    subsequent case law that it is not possible to reduce the real and substantial
    connection test to a fixed formula.&nbsp; A considerable measure of judgment is
    required in assessing whether the real and substantial connection test has been
    met on the facts of a given case.&nbsp; Flexibility is therefore important.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But clarity and certainty are also important.&nbsp;
    As such, it is useful to identify the factors emerging from the case law that
    are relevant in assessing whether a court should assume jurisdiction against an
    out-of-province defendant on the basis of damage sustained in Ontario as a
    result of a tort committed elsewhere.&nbsp; No factor is determinative.&nbsp;
    Rather, all relevant factors should be considered and weighed together.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While
    the real and substantial connection test is a legal rule, the <i>forum non </i><span

    substantial connection test involves a fact-specific inquiry, but the test
    ultimately rests upon legal principles of general application.&nbsp; The
    question is whether the forum can assume jurisdiction over the claims of
    plaintiffs in general against defendants in general given the sort of
    relationship between the case, the parties and the forum.&nbsp; By contrast,
    the <i>forum non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i> test is a
    discretionary test that focuses upon the particular facts of the parties and
    the case.&nbsp; The question is whether the forum should assert jurisdiction at
    the suit of this particular plaintiff against this particular defendant.</p>

    in favour of a different approach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    assumed jurisdiction in cases where the link to Ontario was “damages sustained
    within the jurisdiction”.  However, it
    has been assumed that the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test has wider application, and the eight factor
    test has been routinely used to assess real and substantial connection in all
    cases of assumed jurisdiction.  We now
    have a very significant body of experience and case law that can be used to
    gauge the workability and appropriateness of the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test in cases across a
    wider range of fact situations.  As
    Vaughan Black and Mat <span class=SpellE>Brechtel</span> aptly put it in
    “Revising <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>:
    The Ontario Court of Appeal Takes Another Look” (2009) 36 Adv. Q. 35, at p. 36,
    “It is not surprising that after seven years in the trenches <span

    developments in the jurisprudence, namely, the decisions of the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp</i>.,
    [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, dealing with assumed jurisdiction on the basis of damages
    sustained within the jurisdiction under the <i>Civil Code of Quebec, </i>S.Q. 1991, c. 64<i>,</i> and <i>Beals </i>dealing with the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> has also been considered by appellate courts in
    other provinces and was referred to by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Castillo.  </i>While the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test has generally been
    followed and applied, it has not escaped criticism in the case law: see e.g. <i>Coutu v. Gauthier (Estate)</i> (2006), 264
    D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 319 (N.B.C.A.) ; <i>Black
    v. Breeden</i> (2009), 309 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 708 (S.C.J.)</p>

'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the Uniform Law Conference of Canada has
    developed a model <i>Court Jurisdiction and
    Proceedings Transfer Act </i>(“<i>CJPTA</i>”),
    together with another model act on the enforcement of judgments.  These model acts are intended to implement uniform statutory rules by which
    all Canadian courts establish jurisdiction over particular proceedings.  <i>CJPTA</i> has been adopted in Canadian jurisdictions.  The
    first to enact it (with minor modifications) was Saskatchewan: <i>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer
    Act</i>, S.S. 1997, <span class=GramE>c</span>. C-41.1.  Next was the Yukon Territory (also with minor
    modifications): <i>Court Jurisdiction and
    Proceedings Transfer Act</i>, S.Y. c. 64 a. 3136.  Nova Scotia and British Columbia have also
    adopted <i>CJPTA</i>: <i>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</i>, S.N.S. 2003, c. 2; <i>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings
    Transfer Act</i>, S.B.C. 2003, c. 28.  In addition, the Alberta Law
    Institute in its Report No. 94, 2008, <i>Enforcement
    of Judgments</i> recommends enactment of ULCC package of acts, including the <i>Uniform
    Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Act</i>, as does the Manitoba Law Reform Commission Report 119, 2009
    (both with some modifications).  The
    Ontario Law Commission is currently studying the issue and has published a
    consultation paper: <i>Reforming the Law of <span
class=SpellE>Crossborder</span> Litigation: Judicial Jurisdiction </i>(March,
    2009).  The appellants urge us to adopt
    the test for jurisdiction prescribed by <i>CJPTA</i>.</p>

    of “forum of necessity” or “forum of last resort” has emerged as a significant
    jurisdictional doctrine.  This doctrine
    allows the forum to take jurisdiction in cases despite the absence of a real
    and substantial connection where there is no other forum in which the plaintiff
    could reasonably seek relief. “Forum of necessity” is recognized by Article
    3136 of the Quebec<i> Civil Code</i>,
    incorporated in s. 6 of <i>CJPTA</i>,
    adopted by both the EU and the UK, and was hinted as a possible basis for
    jurisdiction by this court in <span class=SpellE><i>Bouzari</i></span><i> v. Islamic
    Republic of Iran</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 675 (C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    36-38: see also Janet Walker, “<span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> Misplaced: The Future of Forum of Necessity
    Jurisdiction in Canada” (2009) 48 C.B.L.J. 135.  The appellants submit that the <span
class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test was
    formulated so that the reach of assumed jurisdiction was wide enough to
    accommodate certain extraordinary cases where plaintiffs cannot present their
    case elsewhere.  As these cases can now
    be dealt with directly through the forum of necessity doctrine, they argue that
    a narrower test for assumed jurisdiction may safely be applied to other cases.</p>

    such as Ontario’s rule 17.02, providing for service of process outside the
    jurisdiction, with a list of substantive jurisdictional connections that
    presumptively establish a real and substantial connection for both assumed
    jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement.  The Uniform Law Conference Drafters’ Comments
    indicate that this list is “based on the grounds for service <i>ex <span class=SpellE>juris</span></i> in
    the rules of court of many provinces”.  The
    list of connections is not exhaustive; s. 10 explicitly preserves “the right of
    the plaintiff to prove other circumstances that constitute a real and substantial
    connection”.  Nor is real and substantial
    connection made out conclusively if the case falls into one of the categories
    listed; s. 10 merely provides a real and substantial connection is only
    “presumed to exist” and, as explained by the Drafters’ Comments, “[a] defendant
    will still have the right to rebut the presumption by showing that, in the
    facts of the particular case, the defined connection is not real and
    substantial”. </p>

    view, the submissions of the appellants exaggerate both the degree of
    uncertainty produced by <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> and the degree of certainty and predictability that would be achieved by
    adopting <i>CJPTA</i>.  With regard to the alleged uncertainty
    produced by <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>,
    the appellants did not challenge the correctness of the results reached in the <span
class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> quintet
    and were unable to identify conflicting or wrongly decided cases under the <span
class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span><i> </i>test<i>.</i>  With regard to the claim that<i> CJPTA</i> is more certain and predictable, <i>CJPTA</i> retains the real and substantial
    test as the guiding principle but does not define it. The connecting factors
    listed in s. 10 are merely presumptive and they are not exhaustive, leaving the
    issue of real and substantial connection as a matter to be resolved in every
    case. In cases arising in Nova Scotia and British Columbia, jurisdictions that
    have adopted <i>CJPTA, </i>the courts have turned to the <span
class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> factors
    in order to determine what other circumstances could meet the test: see <span
class=SpellE><i>Bouch</i></span><i> v. Penny (Litigation guardian of) </i>(2009), 310 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 433
    (N.S.C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 51-54; <span class=SpellE><i>Stanway</i></span><i> v. Wyeth Canada Ltd.</i> 2008 BCSC 847, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    80-90; <i>Cameron v. <span class=SpellE>Equineox</span> Technologies Ltd.</i> 2009 BCSC 221, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 25-26. Moreover, the s. 10 connecting factors <span class=GramE>are</span> necessarily cast in general terms.  They
    are not self-applying black-letter rules.  Their application requires interpretation and
    consideration of broad issues of fairness and justice.  They do not supersede Dickson J.’s admonition
    in <i>Moran</i> that it would be “unnecessary, and unwise, to have resort to any
    arbitrary set of rules”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, I agree that there is much to be gained
    by paying close attention to the <i>CJPTA</i> model in clarifying or modifying the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test.  We
    should not ignore the considerations that led to the adoption of <i>CJPTA </i>or the criticism that the <span
class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> eight
    factor <span class=GramE>test</span> is too complicated and difficult to apply.
     In refining the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test, we can look to <i>CJPTA</i> as a worthy attempt to restate and
    update the Canadian law of jurisdiction.  We can adopt certain attractive features of <i>CJPTA</i> and, in so doing, bring Ontario
    law into line with the emerging national consensus on appropriate
    jurisdictional standards.</p>

    which gives presumptive effect to a list of connecting factors drawn and
    distilled from provincial rules of court for service <i>ex <span class=SpellE>juris</span></i>. I would adopt and apply this
    approach with reference to rule 17.02.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>, at para. 51, we adopted a statement from Janet Walker in G.D. Watson &amp; L. Jeffrey, eds.,  <span class=SpellE><i>Holmested</i></span><i> and
    Watson: Ontario Civil Procedure</i> (Carswell: Toronto, 2001), at p. 17-19,
    that the grounds outlined in rule 17.02 “provide a rough guide to the kinds of
    cases in which persons outside Ontario will be regarded as subject to the
    jurisdiction of the Ontario courts”.  In
    my view, there are now several reasons that justify elevating the weight to be
    given rule 17.02 by saying that, with the exception of <span class=SpellE>subrules</span> 17.02(h) (“damages sustained in Ontario”) and (o) (“a necessary or proper
    party”), if a case falls within one of the connections listed in rule 17.02, a
    real and substantial connection for the purposes of assuming jurisdiction
    against the defendant shall be presumed to exist.  As with <i>CJPTA</i>,
    s. 10, this presumption would not preclude a plaintiff from proving a real and
    substantial connection in other circumstances and does not preclude the
    defendant from demonstrating that, notwithstanding the fact that the case falls
    under rule 17.02, in the particular circumstances of the case, the real and
    substantial connection test is not met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would make this change to <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span><i> </i>for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, it would bring Ontario law into line with
    one of the central features of <i>CJPTA</i> in a manner consistent with the development of the common law.  I see s. 10 as a carefully crafted list of
    connecting factors, based upon a review of existing rules of court across
    Canada providing for service out of the jurisdiction, that experience has shown
    ordinarily point to a real and substantial connection sufficient to justify the
    assumption of jurisdiction.  With the exceptions
    of <span class=SpellE>subrules</span> 17.02(h) and (o), the connecting factors
    listed in s. 10 of <i>CJPTA</i> are very
    similar to those listed in rule 17.02.  <i>CJPTA</i> approves those connecting factors
    as a reliable guide to the propriety of assumed jurisdiction and this court should
    to do the same with respect to 17.02. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, a review of the post-<span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> jurisprudence indicates
    that virtually all of the cases where it has been found that there is no real
    and substantial <span class=GramE>connection involve</span> the connecting
    factors identified by <span class=SpellE>subrule</span> 17.02(h).  The fact that after seven years of litigating
    the issue there have been very few cases finding no real and substantial
    connection under the other branches of rule 17.02 suggests that, apart from <span
class=SpellE>subrule</span> (h), the connecting factors identified in the rule
    serve as generally reliable indicators of a real and substantial connection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New (W1)&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, there is some support from the
    jurisprudence for looking to the rules for service <i>ex <span class=SpellE>juris</span></i> as a guide to real and
    substantial connection.  In <i>Hunt</i>, La Forest J. stated, at p. 325,
    that although some of the rules for service <i>ex <span class=SpellE>juris</span></i> “may well require reconsideration in light
    of <span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span>,
    the connections relied on under traditional rules are a good place to start.”  In <i>Spar, </i>at para. 56, Lebel J. stated, with reference to art. 3148, the provision of
    the <i>Civil Code of Quebec</i> dealing with
    the jurisdiction of the Quebec courts in civil actions: “I am doubtful that a
    plaintiff who succeeds in proving one of the four grounds for jurisdiction
    would not be considered to have satisfied the ‘real and substantial connection’
    criterion, at least for the purposes of jurisdiction <span class=SpellE><i>simpliciter</i></span>.”
     The British Columbia Court of Appeal
    appears to have treated the cases falling within the rule of court for service <i>ex <span class=SpellE>juris</span></i> as
    presumptively satisfying the real and substantial connection test: see, <span
class=SpellE>eg</span>.<b><i> </i></b><span
class=SpellE><i>Strukoff</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Syncrude</span> Canada Ltd</i> (2000), 80 B.C.L.R. (3d) 294 (C.A.), at para. 10.<a name=citation3></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    presumptive effect will simplify and reduce the incidence and cost of
    litigation on the issue of jurisdiction, this change addresses at least in part
    the concern that the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> test is unduly complex and unwieldy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not give <span class=SpellE>subrules</span> 17.02(h) or (o) presumptive effect for the following reasons.  The fact that neither is included in s. 10 of <i>CJPTA</i> indicates that neither has gained
    general acceptance as a sufficiently reliable indicator of a real and
    substantial connection. See also Janet Walker, “Beyond Real and Substantial
    Connection: The <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> Quintet”, at pp. 71-74.  The “damages
    sustained” rule was adopted to relieve against the very narrow view taken in
    the case law of the reach of the rule allowing for service <i>ex <span class=SpellE>juris</span></i> “in respect of a tort committed
    in Ontario” before that area was liberalized by <i>Moran.</i>  It is clear from the
    reasoning and the results in the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> quintet that there are many situations where
    “damages sustained in Ontario” will not serve as a reliable indicator of a real
    and substantial connection.  In my view,
    this position is not changed by <i>Spar</i>,
    which dealt with injurious acts committed outside Quebec that caused damages
    within Quebec and not the <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span><i> </i>situation
    where a plaintiff was injured outside the forum and then came to the forum and
    subsequently suffered damages: see Janet Walker, “Must there be Uniform
    Standards for Jurisdiction within a Federation?” (2003), 119 L.Q.R. 567, at p.
    570.</p>

    generous scope of Rule 5 for the <span class=SpellE>joinder</span> of parties,
    the fact that a foreign defendant qualifies as a “necessary <i>or </i>proper party” to a proceeding is not,
    by itself, a reliable indicator that there is a real and substantial connection
    to support the assertion of jurisdiction over that defendant. The <i>CJPTA</i> Drafters’ Comment to section 10 is
    apposite:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[S]<span
class=SpellE>uch</span> a rule would be out of place in provisions that are
    based, not on service, but on substantive connections between the proceeding
    and the enacting jurisdiction. If a plaintiff wishes to bring proceedings
    against two defendants, one of whom is ordinarily resident in the enacting
    jurisdiction and the other of whom is not, territorial competence over the
    first defendant will be present.... Territorial competence over the second
    defendant will not be presumed merely on the ground that that person is a necessary
    or proper party to the proceeding against the first person. The proceeding
    against the second person will have to meet the real and substantial connection
    test.</p>

    appellant’s suggestion that plaintiffs should essentially be confined to the enumerated
    categories.  That is not the case under <i>CJPTA</i> and to impose such a limit would
    be inconsistent with the entire thrust of the jurisprudence I have already
    reviewed emphasizing the need for flexibility in this area of law.</p>

    a clear distinction to be drawn between legal jurisdiction <span class=SpellE><i>simpliciter</i></span> and the discretionary
    test for <i>forum non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i>.
     The factors to be considered are
    different and distinct.  In order to
    maintain the necessary degree of certainty and clarity, it is important to
    maintain and respect the distinction between the two tests.  In particular, the factors listed for
    consideration at the second, discretionary, <i>forum
    non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i> stage, have no bearing on real and
    substantial connection and, therefore, should not be considered at the first
    stage of jurisdiction <span class=SpellE><i>simpliciter</i></span> analysis.  The test for jurisdiction <span
class=SpellE><i>simpliciter</i></span> is
    whether there is <i>a</i> real and
    substantial connection, an inquiry that does not turn upon a comparison with
    the strength of the connection with another potentially available jurisdiction.

    test to define the nature or degree of connections required.  In <span

    described a real and substantial connection as a connection “between the <i>subject-matter

    jurisdiction and the <i>wrongdoing</i>”, “between the <i>damages suffered</i> and the jurisdiction”, “between the <i>defendant</i> and the forum province”,

    54-74, in rejecting the argument that assumed jurisdiction should focus solely
    or primarily upon the nature and extent of the <i>defendant’s</i> contacts with the jurisdiction.  We concluded, at para. 74, that “[w]<span

    put it in <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>,
    at para. 77, when explaining the importance of defining the real and
    substantial connection test broadly enough to embrace consideration of the
    connection between the forum and the plaintiff’s claim: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The forum has an interest in protecting the legal rights of its
    residents and affording injured plaintiffs generous access for litigating
    claims against <span class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span>.&nbsp; In <i>Moran v. Pyle</i> at p. 409, Dickson J. spoke of “the important interest a state has in injuries
    suffered by persons within its territory”.&nbsp; The <i>Moran</i> decision and
    the introduction of the “damage sustained” rule in 1975 were both motivated by
    the perception that the interests of justice required a more generous approach
    to assumed jurisdiction.&nbsp; The connection between the forum and the
    plaintiff’s claim is therefore relevant.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    and the defendant, the primary focus is on things done by the defendant within
    the jurisdiction.  Where the defendant
    confines its activities to its home jurisdiction, it will not ordinarily be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the forum: see e.g. <span class=SpellE><i>Lemmex</i></span>, <span class=SpellE><i>Leufkins</i></span> and <i>Sinclair</i>.  However, as was
    held in <i>Moran</i>, physical presence or
    activity within the jurisdiction is not always required.  Where a defendant could reasonably foresee
    that its conduct would cause harm within the forum by putting a product into
    the normal channels of trade and knows, or ought to know, that the product
    would be used in the forum and that if defective could harm a consumer in the
    forum, jurisdiction may be assumed.  </p>

    jurisdiction should be assumed over a defendant who ought to reasonably have
    contemplated being called upon to account in the forum.  It is difficult to see how a proposition
    stated that broadly could avoid subjecting anyone who has regular dealings with
    extra-provincial parties from rendering themselves subject to the home
    jurisdiction of the extra-provincial customer.  In <i>Sinclair</i>,
    we dealt with restaurant owners who regularly do business with extra-provincial
    customers.  I see no reason to depart
    from what we said at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Restaurant owners and
    operators deal with customers who are traveling away from home on a regular and
    routine basis.&nbsp; To require restaurant owners and operators to litigate the
    claims of customers wherever they reside would impose a heavy burden that is
    difficult to justify under the principles of order and fairness expressed in <span
class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span><i> </i>and <i>Hunt</i>.&nbsp; Travelers
    from all corners of the earth might choose to dine in any Ontario
    restaurant.&nbsp; Absent special circumstances, to require Ontario restaurant
    owners and operators to defend their conduct in the home jurisdictions of their
    customers would impose an undue and unreasonable burden on them.&nbsp; If
    Ontario courts are not prepared to impose that burden on Ontario restaurant
    owners and operators, we should also refuse to assume jurisdiction against
    foreign restaurant owners and operators sued by Ontario residents for consequential
    damages resulting from a tort committed outside the province.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    made in <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>,
    at para. 83, between the degree of <span class=SpellE>foreseeability</span> motivating <i>Moran</i> and the situation
    where a wrongful act and injury occur outside the jurisdiction and the plaintiff
    returns home and continues to suffer consequential damage.  The fact that it was foreseeable that a
    visiting plaintiff will return home and continue to suffer damages from the
    injury does not, by itself, make the defendant subject to the plaintiff’s home
    jurisdiction under the <i>Moran</i> principle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    residence or carrying on business will often support a real and substantial
    connection. As stated in <i>Beals</i>, at
    para. 32, “a defendant can reasonably be brought within the embrace of a
    foreign jurisdiction’s law where he or she has participated in something of
    significance or was actively involved in that foreign jurisdiction.” </p>

    connection” and in terms of “order and fairness”.  The two concepts are correlative and
    inextricably related.  As stated in <i>Hunt</i>, at p. 326, the assumption of jurisdiction “must ultimately be guided by the
    requirements of order and fairness, not a mechanical counting of contacts or
    connections”.  As we stated in <span
class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>, at para.
    86, proper consideration of the defendant’s position cannot be accomplished
    simply by looking at the acts or conduct that would render the defendant
    subject to the jurisdiction. The quality, strength or significance of those
    contacts cannot be assessed in a purely mechanical fashion.  The inquiry necessarily entails consideration
    of the fairness or unfairness of asserting jurisdiction against the defendant
    in light of those contacts.  As the Nova
    Scotia Court of Appeal held in <i>O’Brien v.
    Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2002), 201 N.S.R. (2d) 338, at para. 20, leave

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The concept of order and fairness is integral to the question of

    unnecessary and unrealistic rigidity to a test that is clearly designed to be
    flexible. To impose such a constraint would prevent a judge's assessment of the
    totality of the evidence when deciding whether the circumstances made it proper
    to accept jurisdiction over the action as framed by the plaintiff.</span></p>

'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    principles of order and fairness apply equally to the plaintiff and, as stated
    in <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span>,
    at para. 89, the entire thrust of modern jurisprudence, from <i>Moran</i> to <span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span> and beyond, has been to
    broaden the inquiry beyond the contacts the defendant has with the jurisdiction
    and to include consideration of fairness to the plaintiff: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span> and <i>Moran </i>both hold that given the
    realities of modern commerce and the free flow of goods and people across
    borders, plaintiffs should not be saddled with the anachronistic “power theory”
    that focuses exclusively on subjection and territorial sovereignty.&nbsp;
    Although <span class=SpellE><i>Tolofson</i></span> dealt with choice of law, at
    pp. 1071-72, the court also speaks of the need to balance the interests of the
    plaintiff and defendant.&nbsp; Further, in <i>Oakley v. Barry</i>, [(1998),
    166 N.S.R. (2d) 282, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1998] S.C.C.A. No.
    282] <span class=SpellE>Pugsley</span> J.A. held at p. 699 that “[t]he concept of fairness in determining jurisdiction
    should be considered from the point of view of both the respondent [plaintiff],
    as well as the appellants [defendants]”.&nbsp; I agree that it is important to
    consider fairness to the plaintiff and to balance this against fairness to the

    the fairness of assuming or refusing jurisdiction as a consideration that bears
    upon the real and substantial connection test.  However, I would explain and clarify what was
    said in <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span> and limit the extent to which fairness considerations apply in the manner

    seen as a separate inquiry unrelated to the core of the test, the connection
    between the forum, the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant.  Consideration of fairness should rather serve
    as an analytic tool to assess the relevance, quality and strength of those
    connections, whether they amount to a real and substantial connection, and
    whether assuming jurisdiction accords with the principles of order and

    unfairness to the plaintiff in not assuming jurisdiction does not amount to an
    independent factor capable of trumping the want of a real and substantial connection
    between the forum and the plaintiff’s claim and/or the defendant.  Moreover, the fact that the foreign defendant
    is insured against the risk of litigation does not overcome a lack of
    connection between the claim or the defendant and the forum, and insurance is a
    matter that is more properly considered in relation to <i>forum non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i>. </p>

    direct bearing on this issue.  The forum
    of necessity doctrine recognizes that there will be exceptional cases where,
    despite the absence of a real and substantial connection, the need to ensure
    access to justice will justify the assumption of jurisdiction.  The forum of necessity doctrine does not
    redefine real and substantial connection to embrace “forum of last resort”
    cases; it operates as an exception to the real and substantial connection test.
     Where there is no other forum in which
    the plaintiff can reasonably seek relief, there is a residual discretion to
    assume jurisdiction.  In my view, the
    overriding concern for access to justice that motivates the assumption of
    jurisdiction despite inadequate connection with the forum should be
    accommodated by explicit recognition of the forum of necessity exception rather
    than by distorting the real and substantial connection test. </p>

     Consideration of jurisdiction <span

    only in cases where it is asserted as a possible (not a presumptive) connecting
    factor that may justify assuming jurisdiction.  In addition, at the <i>forum non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i> stage, the avoidance of a multiplicity of

    principle that emerges from the assimilation in <span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span> and <i>Hunt</i> of the rules for jurisdiction over foreign defendants and the
    rules for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  If a court holds that there is a real and substantial
    connection sufficient to justify asserting jurisdiction against a foreign
    defendant, it thereby holds that there would be a real and substantial
    connection sufficient to require recognition and enforcement of a foreign
    judgment against an Ontario defendant rendered on the same basis.  That is an important general legal principle
    that disciplines the assumption of jurisdiction against extra-provincial
    defendants.  It is a principle that a
    court should bear in mind when considering whether to assume jurisdiction
    against an extra-provincial defendant.  If the court would not be prepared to
    recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment against an Ontario defendant
    rendered on the same jurisdictional basis, it should not assume jurisdiction
    against the extra-provincial defendant.</p>

    international law as they apply between the provinces must be shaped to conform
    to the federal structure of the Constitution.”  In <i>Hunt</i> at p. 323, La Forest J.
    referred to the distinction drawn in <i>Aetna Financial Services Ltd. v. <span

    ‘real and substantial connection’ test, which is applied to interprovincial
    judgments, should apply equally to the recognition of foreign judgments”,&nbsp;obliterates
    the distinction between interprovincial and international cases. In my view, by
    applying the real and substantial connection test to international judgments, <i>Beals</i> does not require that in its
    precise application in particular cases, the real and substantial connection
    test will inevitably treat interprovincial and international cases identically.
     There is nothing in <i>Beals</i> that considers or disputes the reasons given in <span

    standards in a manner that takes into account the realities of a federation
    with a shared legal tradition and integrated economic and social connections.  Moreover, that distinction was reiterated by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in a post-<i>Beals </i>decision, albeit in a <i>forum non <span

    these resorts. These resorts rely on an international market and Canada, and in
    particular Ontario, provides a large portion of tourists purchasing vacation
    packages. CRL has a legal obligation to market these resorts internationally.
    It fulfills its obligation in Ontario by way of an agreement with <span

class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> brand, used by CRL to promote the resort, is
    held out in promotional materials as having an office in Ontario. In brochures

    is part of the promotion of the <span class=SpellE>SuperClubs</span> brand in

style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I respectfully disagree with the way the motion
    judge dealt with the issue of fairness.  In
    my view, by considering the difficulties the parties would face in arranging
    for witnesses to testify in either Cuba or Ontario, he conflated the <i>forum non conveniens </i>test with the test
    for real and substantial connection.  I
    will return to consider those factors when I consider the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. </p>

style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, when I consider the connections between
    the claim, CRL and Ontario through the lens of fairness to assess their
    significance and weight in relation to a real and substantial connection, I
    agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that fairness supports the assumption
    of jurisdiction against CRL.  In
    particular, I see nothing unfair in requiring CRL to defend this action in
    Ontario.  As I have already indicated,
    CRL actively marketed in Ontario the all-inclusive vacation that the Charrons
    purchased in a variety of ways. While the contract between CRL and Hola Sun
    provided for the application of Cuban law and for Cuban jurisdiction in
    relation to disputes arising between CRL and Hola Sun, that provision has no
    application to the Charrons.  </p>

    the light of these <span class=GramE>connections,</span> and subject to the
    consideration of <i>forum non conveniens</i>,
    there is nothing unfair about requiring CRL to defend this claim in Ontario. </p>

style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An important discipline on the real and
    substantial connection inquiry and check on jurisdictional overreaching is to
    ask whether Ontario would be willing to recognize and enforce an
    extra-provincial judgment rendered on the same jurisdictional basis as that
    being asserted here.  In my view, the
    answer to that question is yes.  CRL’s
    activities are far removed from those of a local tourist business – the
    restaurant owner discussed in <i>Sinclair</i> or the much discussed Algonquin canoe renter - that accepts business from out-of-province
    defendants but essentially confines its activities to Ontario.  CRL targeted the Ontario market, it entered into
    contracts in Ontario with Ontario entities to promote its business, it ensured
    that printed promotional materials were available to allow Ontario travel
    agents to sell the products it was promoting, and its interests were fostered
    by the physical presence in Ontario of a SuperClubs office and contact person.  In my view, if an Ontario defendant were to
    engage in a comparable level of activity in a foreign jurisdiction, Ontario
    would recognize and enforce a judgment rendered against the Ontario defendant
    by the courts of that foreign jurisdiction. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that some defence
    witnesses would have to travel from Cuba and observed that Cuban travel and
    immigration restraints might “make their travel to Ontario for a trial
    difficult or impossible”.  On the other
    hand, he noted that there was evidence from an expert on Cuban law that alternative
    arrangements could be made to take their evidence in Cuba, if the trial were
    held in Ontario.  Moreover, the
    plaintiffs would have to arrange for the attendance of several physicians and
    other individuals from Ontario who had been with them when the accident
    occurred.  The motion judge noted that
    CRL is not domiciled in Cuba and that it is insured against liability in
    Ontario.  While evidence of Cuban law
    will be required if the action proceeds in Ontario, both parties had already
    retained Cuban law experts.  The action
    also involves Bel Air and Hola Sun, Ontario corporations named as defendants
    and who assert cross-claims against CRL, and permitting suit here would avoid a
    multiplicity of proceedings and the risk of inconsistent results.  There is an issue as to whether the plaintiffs
    will be able to claim under the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> given the <i>lex loci delicti</i> rule laid down in <i>Tolofson</i>.  The motion judge may have oversimplified the
    discussion of whether such a claim could be made if the action proceeds in
    Ontario.  However, it is clear that such
    damages would be excluded if the Charrons were forced to sue in Cuba.  There are also statements from this court
    suggesting that, in some cases, claims for <i>Family
    Law Act</i> damages may fall into the exceptional category mentioned in <i>Tolofson</i>: see <i>Hanlan v. Sernesky</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 479 (C.A.); <i>Wong v. Lee</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 398

    judge’s conclusion that there was “a significant connection between the
    plaintiffs claim and Ontario” on the basis that the contract was entered into
    in Ontario.  All the arrangements were
    made through Denis and Sport au Soleil in Ontario.  Denis confirmed those arrangements with a
    letter to Berg, written on the letterhead “SuperClubs Cuba – Tennis”, setting
    out the dates, instructions on how to get to the hotel, and specifying the
    nature of Berg’s duties.  The letter
    specified the terms of Berg’s arrangement with the resort: “In exchange for
    your services the hotel will accommodate you and your guest in a shared room.  This also includes all meals and drinks and
    transportation to and from the Veradero airport.”  The letter concludes with an instruction
    addressed to the Hotel Reception Desk: “The above individual has been confirmed
    for these dates with the hotel General Manager.” </p>

style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was no written contract between Denis and
    CRL, but in my view, it may be inferred from the letter Abe Moore wrote to
    Denis asking him to find tennis teaching professionals that Denis was acting,
    as the motion judge put it, “in part at least” as CRL’s agent:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not want to do a formal arrangement nor get into a long term
    arrangement, we just want to be able to find some people who are prepared to
    teach for a couple of hours each day in exchange for accommodations for two
    people sharing. I am prepared to compensate you, hopefully in kind, for your
    efforts. </p>

style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his affidavit, Moore described his
    arrangement with Denis as “an oral contract…whereby Sport au Soleil arranges
    for the services of various professionals such as the plaintiff, Viktor Berg.”  Denis used the SuperClubs trademark on his
    letterhead, he wrote the letter confirming the terms of the arrangement with
    the resort that CRL operated and he instructed the registration desk at the
    resort in Cuba that Berg’s arrangements were “confirmed”.  Denis’ conduct, including the letter he wrote
    on Berg and Van Breda’s behalf setting out the terms of their contract, was
    accepted and acted on by CRL, giving rise to an inference of agency.  I see no merit in the submission that the
    motion judge made a palpable or overriding error in finding that Denis was
    acting “in part at least” as CRL’s agent in making these arrangements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor do I see any merit in CRL’s submission that
    there was no binding contract until Berg and Van Breda arrived at and checked
    in to the hotel.  This is not the usual
    case where an Ontario resident simply makes a reservation with an out-of-province
    hotel and then finalizes the details of the contract upon arrival and check-in.
     Berg made all his arrangements with an Ontario-based
    entity clothed with the necessary authority to commit the foreign-based hotel
    to an unusual and specific arrangement for the provision of services in exchange
    for the provision of accommodation.  See <i>Fordyce v. Round Hill Developments</i>, 1978
    U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19112, where the District Court for the Southern District of
    New York declined to assume jurisdiction over the defendant owner of a Jamaican
    hotel as the New York agent of the hotel could not bind the resort by
    confirming reservations, an ability which could have been sufficient to ground
    the assumption of jurisdiction over Round Hill on the basis of ‘doing
    business’, as interpreted in <i>Frummer v.
    Hilton Hotels</i>, (1967) 19 N.Y.2d 533.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, there was no tour operator
    standing between the clients and CRL: the contract for the all-inclusive
    vacation was made directly with CRL.  I
    conclude that, based upon the facts alleged in the pleadings and the evidence
    led on the motion, the respondents’ claim against CRL falls within the
    connection described in rule 17.02 (f)(i) as a claim “in respect of a contract
    where…the contract was made in Ontario”.  I would accordingly hold that a real and
    substantial connection between the claim and Ontario is presumed to exist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The claim is framed both in contract and in tort.  Arguably, it is more tortious that contractual
    in nature. However, that does not defeat or minimize the significance of the
    contract as a significant connection with Ontario.  First, there is a strong nexus and overlap
    between claims in contract and tort, and there is concurrent liability for
    negligence arising from contractual relationships.  A party is not required to elect between suing
    in tort or contract; the general rule is that of concurrent liability where a
    wrong supports an action in both contract and tort: <i>BG Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power
    Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12. Second, the application of the real and
    substantial connection test in this context should not turn on a technical
    characterization of the plaintiff’s cause of action.  The issue is the significance of the connections
    of the defendant with Ontario, and CRL cannot escape the fact that the Ontario
    contract framed its relationship with the plaintiffs.  The fact that the claim may sound deeper in
    tort that it does in contract does not diminish the significance of the
    contract as establishing between CRL and the plaintiffs a significant
    connection that was formed in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As this presumption is not conclusive, it
    remains open to CRL to demonstrate that in the particular circumstances of the
    case, the real and substantial connection test is not met.  I will now consider whether, on the facts of this
    case, CRL has rebutted that presumption under the revised test for real and
    substantial connection </p>

    suffered no damages in Ontario.  On the
    other hand, Van Breda and Berg were residents of Ontario before travelling to
    Cuba and they would have returned to Ontario but for the injury Van Breda
    sustained.  In my view, the significance
    of the fact that they do not now reside in Ontario is diminished, as the only
    reason they did not return was the very injury that gives rise to the claim.  In any event, the fact that the contractual
    arrangements were made in Ontario reflects a significant connection between the
    plaintiffs’ claim and Ontario.</p>

    was responsible for international advertising campaigns and international
    public relations campaigns to promote the resort. To carry out these
    responsibilities, CRL engaged professionals in Ontario to prepare promotional
    materials and entered contracts with Ontario tour operators to advertise and
    promote the resort.  The record in the
    Van Breda appeal includes evidence of CRL’s use of Nancy Hay and the Ontario
    SuperClubs office to promote its activities.  In a letter written by Abe Moore to Rene Denis
    regarding making promotional materials available, Moore wrote: “By copy of this
    fax I am making Mrs. Nancy Hay, Director of Sales, SuperClubs Canada, aware
    that you may contact her for assistance with promotions.” </p>

    the Charron appeal.  While the motion
    judge erred by considering issues of fairness more appropriately dealt with
    under <i>forum non conveniens, </i>when the
    connections between the plaintiffs’ claim, the defendant and Ontario are
    considered and weighed from the perspective of fairness, assuming jurisdiction
    against CRL is fully supported.  This is
    not a case of a local operator that confined its activities to its home
    jurisdiction.  CRL engaged in promotional
    activities in Ontario and the contract it entered with Berg was made in Ontario
    through an agent in Ontario that CRL used to solicit professional athletes as
    resort instructors.  Viewed through the
    lens of fairness, these connections are sufficient to justify the finding of a
    real and substantial connection.  </p>

    Canada and while CRL carries on business in Cuba, it is located in the Cayman
    Islands.  While obtaining the evidence of
    Cuban nationals in Ontario would be challenging, there was expert evidence
    explaining how their evidence could be obtained for use in an Ontario court.  As Cuban law excluded damages for pain and
    suffering and for loss of care, guidance and companionship, the plaintiffs could
    suffer a loss of juridical advantage.  In
    my view, the fact that CRL is insured may be taken into account at the <i>forum non conveniens</i> stage as a factor
    mitigating any difficulty CRL may have in litigating this case in Ontario.</p>

    conflicting evidence on the fairness of the Cuban legal system.  A former Canadian ambassador testified that
    the Cuban courts lacked judicial independence while an expert on Cuban law
    testified that the Cuban system of civil justice was fair and consistent with
    the civil law process in other civil countries.  The former ambassador conceded that his
    concerns regarding lack of judicial independence arose from the administration
    of criminal justice in Cuba.  The motion
    judge concluded that there was “an uncertainty which exists in respect of the
    fairness of the legal system in Cuba”.  In
    my view, comity requires more that “an uncertainty” to justify a judicial
    determination that condemns a foreign legal system as unfair.  However, the uncertainty regarding the
    fairness of the Cuban legal system was discussed by the motion judge when
    dealing with jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i>,
    and the extent to which it affected his assessment of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> issue is not clear.   </p>
