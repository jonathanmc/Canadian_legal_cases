  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 1995, Dr. Duncan MacRae, the appellant,
    discovered that two of his patients, on whom he had performed tympanoplasty
    surgery at the London Health Sciences Centre (the “Hospital”), had suffered
    profound hearing loss as a result.  The
    cause was the use of a new antiseptic recently introduced by the Hospital.  The Hospital accepted liability and settled
    with both patients.  It then proceeded to
    trial, claiming that Dr. MacRae was also responsible, and seeking contribution
    and indemnity from him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge agreed, finding that Dr. MacRae was
    negligent in failing to inform himself that the new antiseptic could be
    ototoxic (i.e., could cause functional impairment to the ear).  He held Dr. MacRae and the Hospital equally
    negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. MacRae appeals from this judgment.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow
    his appeal, and dismiss the Hospital’s claim for contribution and indemnity.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 1994, the Hospital set up the Topical
    Antiseptic Committee (the “TAC”) to standardize the topical antiseptic
    solutions used throughout the Hospital for purposes such as pre-operative skin
    preparation.  While about 12 different
    solutions were used, the main one, called Savlon, was thought by some not to be
    sufficiently effective.  A stronger and
    more effective solution, with the brand name Stanhexidine, was becoming
    commercially available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The active ingredient in both these antiseptic
    solutions, which ultimately caused the hearing loss in the two patients, was chlorhexidine.  Its concentration in Savlon was 0.015 %.  The chlorhexidine concentration in
    Stanhexidine was 2.0%, or about 130 times stronger than Savlon.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The TAC consulted with the chief of surgery while
    conducting its review, believing incorrectly that he was responsible for and
    would know about all the surgery being done at the Hospital.  It did not consult Dr. MacRae or anyone else
    from the otolaryngology department (“Otolaryngology”) at the Hospital and hence
    was unaware that Otolaryngology was using Savlon as the pre-operative
    antiseptic solution for tympanoplasty operations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The TAC ultimately recommended to the Hospital’s
    Medical Advisory Committee (the “MAC”) that the stronger antiseptic solution be
    accepted as the cutaneous antiseptic solution used throughout at the Hospital.  Dr. MacRae, who was the chief of
    Otolaryngology, was a member of the MAC and was present at its meeting on
    November 10, 1994 when the change to Stanhexidine was approved.  However, he understood that this was not applicable
    to his department and asked no questions about the proposed change.  As of December 1994, the Hospital stopped
    using Savlon and substituted Stanhexidine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In surgery on January 17, 1995, Dr. MacRae noticed that
    the preparatory antiseptic solution was Stanhexidine instead of Savlon.  He asked the otolaryngology charge nurse,
    Barry Wistow, about it.  Mr. Wistow said
    that he had been told by the pharmacy department of the Hospital (“Pharmacy”)
    that Stanhexidine was the replacement for Savlon, and was the same as Savlon,
    something Mr. Wistow said he had also been told at a head nurses’ meeting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. MacRae had used Savlon as the preparatory
    antiseptic solution in tympanoplasty surgery from the time of his residency
    training in the early 1970s until the Hospital policy change in December
    1994.  While he did not know its
    composition or that it contained chlorhexidine, he knew Savlon to be safe based
    on his experience and his use of it for over 20 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that in March 1995 Dr. MacRae used
    Stanhexidine in both the tympanoplasty surgeries in this case, and that this
    caused the hearing loss suffered by both patients.  His preparatory procedure was to place a
    cotton ball in the ear canal if there was a perforation, apply the preparatory
    antiseptic solution to the surrounding skin, draw off the excess solution,
    remove the cotton ball and suction out any remaining solution before proceeding
    with the operation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. MacRae learned of the hearing loss of his patients
    on May 25, 1995.  This was the first time
    any patient of his had sustained profound hearing loss after tympanoplasty
    surgery.  Since there had been no
    surgical problem in either case, he called Pharmacy to ask if Stanhexidine
    could be the cause of the hearing loss.  The manager of Pharmacy told him that Stanhexidine was not ototoxic, and
    that it was a different solution than Savlon and was a hundred times
    stronger.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. MacRae then immediately contacted Mr. Wistow, and
    told him to stop the use of Stanhexidine because he was concerned about a bad
    batch of the new solution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given Dr. MacRae’s concern that the new antiseptic
    solution may have caused the harm in both cases, the manager of Pharmacy made
    further inquiries of a microbiologist in the Hospital’s department of Clinical
    Microbiology and Infection Control.  Later
    that same day, the microbiologist, Dr. Zafar Hussain, called Dr. MacRae.  As found by the trial judge, Dr. Hussain told
    Dr. MacRae that Stanhexidine was ototoxic and significantly stronger than
    Savlon, leading Dr. MacRae to realize for the first time that both antiseptic
    solutions contained chlorhexidine and that Stanhexidine was ototoxic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial in this matter followed the settlement
    reached between the Hospital and the two patients.  It proceeded as a claim by the Hospital for
    contribution and indemnity from Dr. MacRae.  Through the commendably professional work of counsel, much of the
    evidence went in as an agreed statement of facts.  Only three witnesses were required <i>viva voce</i>:<i> </i>Dr. MacRae and an expert witness called by each party.  As a result, the evidence took only three
    days to complete.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge set out the main issues as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(A)&nbsp;Did
    Dr. MacRae breach the standard of care as of January 1995 by failing to make
    more inquiries regarding the&nbsp; properties of Stanhexidine prior to using it
    as a preparatory solution for ear surgery?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(B) Did
    Dr. MacRae breach the standard of care by failing to know that chlorhexidine
    was ototoxic?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(C) Did
    Dr. MacRae’s method of preparing the ear for tympanoplasty surgery breach the
    standard of care?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the third issue, the trial judge concluded that the
    manner in which Dr. MacRae prepared the ear for surgery met the standard of
    care in both operations.  Both experts
    agreed that his method was entirely satisfactory, and his use of a cotton ball
    as a temporary barrier when using a chlorhexidine-based solution was
    appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second issue, the trial judge concluded that
    there was no persuasive evidence to suggest that in 1995 the otolaryngology
    community was aware of the ototoxicity of chlorhexidine as a preparatory
    antiseptic solution for ear surgeries.  Dr. MacRae’s failure to know that chlorhexidine was ototoxic was
    therefore not a breach of the standard of care.  What the trial judge ultimately focused on was not Dr. MacRae’s failure
    to know but his failure to make further inquiries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As stated by the trial judge, the first issue was
    whether Dr. MacRae breached the standard of care by failing to make more
    inquiries regarding the properties of Stanhexidine prior to using it as a preparatory
    solution for ear surgery.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ultimately found that Dr. MacRae was
    negligent in not making sufficient inquiries and that this was a cause of the
    harm suffered by the two patients.  Since
    there is no dispute that their hearing loss was due to the ototoxicity of chlorhexidine
    in the preparatory antiseptic solution used, it is clear that the trial judge
    must have concluded that further inquiries would have informed Dr. MacRae of
    the ototoxicity of chlorhexidine and therefore allowed him to avoid the harm
    that resulted.  Otherwise the failure to
    make further inquiries would not have been a cause of the harm suffered by the
    two patients.  Reflecting this line of reasoning,
    the trial judge made a finding of fact that a call to Pharmacy after January
    17, 1995 would have provided Dr. MacRae with information that chlorhexidine in
    higher concentrations could be ototoxic.  The trial judge found that this information should have led Dr. MacRae
    to further inquire if the 2% chlorhexidine concentration in Stanhexidine was
    safe or ototoxic, and presumably, this would have resulted in Dr. MacRae
    learning that chlorhexidine was in fact ototoxic.  However the trail judge’s focus was on
    whether Dr. MacRae made sufficient inquiries, rather than on the results these
    inquiries might have yielded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He first held that Dr. MacRae was negligent in failing
    to inquire at the MAC meeting on November 10, 1994 whether the proposed change
    from Savlon to Stanhexidine included his own department, since that information
    would have given Dr. MacRae the opportunity to make further inquiries regarding
    the composition of Stanhexidine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to Dr. MacRae’s reliance on
    the information provided to him by Mr. Wistow on January 17, 1995.  The trial judge accepted the evidence of the
    Hospital’s expert, Dr. John Rutka, that this reliance fell below the applicable
    standard of care, and that Dr. MacRae should have verified that information
    before relying on it in further surgeries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge accepted Dr. Rutka’s opinion
    that the standard of care required Dr. MacRae to know the composition of the new
    solution he was using.  The trial judge
    found that the minimum research that would then have been expected of Dr.
    MacRae was to identify the composition of Savlon.  This would have revealed that the
    concentration of chlorhexidine in Stanhexidine was 130 times greater than in
    Savlon, and that this should have led Dr. MacRae to undertake further research,
    presumably ultimately disclosing that chlorhexidine was ototoxic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on these failures, the trial judge concluded that
    Dr. MacRae’s conduct fell below the applicable standard of care, and that this
    negligence, equally with that of the Hospital, caused the hearing loss of the
    two patients.  Dr. MacRae was therefore
    ordered to make contribution to the Hospital of one half of the settlement it
    had paid to both patients.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three challenges to the trial
    judge’s findings against him:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>(a) The trial judge erred
    in concluding that he was negligent in failing to inquire at the MAC meeting on
    November 10, 1994, whether the proposed change from Savlon to Stanhexidine
    included his own department;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>(b) The trial judge erred
    in concluding that he breached the standard of care by relying on the information
    provided to him by Mr. Wistow on January 17, 1995, when he continued to use
    Stanhexidine in the tympanoplasty operations in question; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>(c) The trial judge’s
    finding that if Dr. MacRae had contacted Pharmacy after January 17, 1995, he
    would have been advised that chlorhexidine in higher concentrations could be
    ototoxic constitutes a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant that the trial judge’s
    finding of negligence based on Dr. MacRae’s failure to inquire at the MAC
    meeting cannot stand.  The Hospital did
    not advance this position at trial, nor attempt to defend it on appeal.  It simply argued that the MAC meeting was
    another opportunity for Dr. MacRae to make inquiries, of which he failed to
    take advantage.  The Hospital did not
    argue that his failure to inquire at that meeting was itself negligent.  No evidence was led at trial suggesting that
    Dr. MacRae breached the standard of care required of him by failing to inquire
    at the meeting.  Moreover, s. 13(1) of
    the<i> Public Hospital Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.40 protects him from liability for acts done in good faith as a member of
    the MAC.  This finding of negligence must
    be set aside. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In dealing with Dr. MacRae’s reliance on the
    information provided by Mr. Wistow on January 17, 1995, the trial judge relied
    on the standard of care testified to by the Hospital’s expert Dr. Rutka.  He opined that Dr. MacRae could not content
    himself with Mr. Wistow’s information, but was obliged to verify the
    information by looking it up in the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties
    (the “CPS”), which is the standard Canadian drug reference book, or by calling
    Pharmacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since, as the trial judge properly found, there was no
    evidence that his fellow specialists were aware of the ototoxicity of chlorhexidine,
    the standard of care proposed by Dr. Rutka would require Dr. MacRae to seek and
    acquire information beyond that which the otolaryngology community was shown to
    have.  Whether it can therefore
    constitute the proper standard of care in the circumstances of this case need
    not be decided, because I agree with the appellant that Dr. MacRae was in
    compliance with it in any event when he relied on the information from Mr.
    Wistow.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Wistow did nothing more on January 17, 1995 than
    relay information from Pharmacy about the new solution.  Mr. Wistow was not giving Dr. MacRae his own
    opinion about Stanhexidine, but was simply serving as the messenger to
    communicate Pharmacy’s view about Stanhexidine and its equivalence to
    Savlon.  Mr. Wistow was the otolaryngology
    charge nurse.  Dr. MacRae had worked with
    him for 16 years, and never had any reason to question or doubt what he
    said.  Dr. MacRae was entitled to treat
    what Mr. Wistow told him as information coming from Pharmacy.  In a real sense therefore, Dr. MacRae did
    obtain from the Pharmacy department on January 17, 1995 their information about
    the new solution he used in the two operations in March 1995.  This met the standard of care described by
    Dr. Rutka and adopted by the trial judge.  Dr. MacRae could properly proceed with the two tympanoplasty operations
    in March on the basis that Pharmacy believed Stanhexidine was equivalent to
    Savlon.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s third argument addresses the trial
    judge’s conclusion that not only could Dr. MacRae not rely on the information
    from Mr. Wistow, but he was bound to inquire further about the composition of
    Stanhexidine.  The trial judge found that
    an inquiry of Pharmacy after January 17, 1995 would have provided Dr. MacRae
    with the information that chlorhexidine in higher concentrations could be
    ototoxic and that this should have led to further questions, presumably
    revealing ultimately that Stanhexidine was ototoxic.  The appellant says that this finding
    constitutes palpable and overriding error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.  As of January
    17, 1995, Pharmacy viewed Stanhexidine as equivalent to Savlon, which Dr.
    MacRae knew to be safe, not ototoxic.  On
    May 25, 1995, when Dr. MacRae inquired from Pharmacy about Stanhexidine, the
    response was that it was not ototoxic.  Neither of these facts permit the inference that in March 1995, prior to
    the two operations that caused the harm, Pharmacy would have informed Dr.
    MacRae that chlorhexidine in higher concentrations could be ototoxic.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that in light of Dr. MacRae’s concern that
    Stanhexidine may have caused the harm in the two operations, Pharmacy made a
    further inquiry of a microbiologist at the Hospital on May 25, 1995 that
    resulted in information being conveyed to Dr. MacRae that Stanhexidine was
    ototoxic.  However, that happened in the
    context of the attempt to explain the harm suffered by the two patients.  It is simply not reasonable to infer from
    this that the same chain of events would have occurred had Dr. MacRae contacted
    Pharmacy prior to the two operations, before any harm had been suffered.  Nor could Pharmacy have found that chlorhexidine
    in higher concentrations could be ototoxic by consulting the CPS, which said
    nothing at that time about chlorhexidine being possibly ototoxic.  Finally, as the trial judge found, the two
    available studies in the literature at that time on the ototoxicity of chlorhexidine
    were neither unequivocal nor conclusive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, there was no evidence from which a
    reasonable inference could be drawn that had Dr. MacRae called Pharmacy after
    January 17, 1995, and before the surgery was performed, he would have been
    informed that chlorhexidine in higher concentrations could be ototoxic, or that
    further research would have led Dr. MacRae to the conclusion that chlorhexidine
    was in fact ototoxic.  Hence, even if Dr.
    MacRae was obliged to make further inquiries, there is no basis to find that
    this would have produced information that chlorhexidine in higher
    concentrations could be ototoxic or was in fact ototoxic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I conclude that there is no basis on
    which to find Dr. MacRae negligent in this case.  The appeal must be allowed and the Hospital’s
    claim for contribution and indemnity must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal,
    fixed on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $20,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.  The appellant is
    also entitled to his costs of the trial as assessed.</p>
