  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Health care professionals are prohibited
    from having sexual intercourse with a patient. If they do, that is professional
    misconduct, defined as sexual abuse, and is punishable by mandatory revocation
    of the professional’s certificate of registration for a minimum of five years: <i>Health Professions Procedural Code</i> (Schedule 2 to the <i>Regulated Health
    Professions Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 18), ss. 1(3), 51(5), 72(3).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Because this is a zero-tolerance
    provision, it applies whenever a regulated health care professional has sexual intercourse
    with a patient, regardless of the circumstances. Because of the mandatory penalty
    of five years out of practice for the health care professional, courts have
    struggled with the application of the section in circumstances that may appear not
    to fit the ordinary understanding of sexual abuse, such as where the patient is
    a spouse or in an intimate partnership with the health care professional. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      In this case, the respondent chiropractor
    was in a committed relationship with the complainant and was co-habiting with
    her before he commenced treating her as a patient. The discipline committee of
    the College of Chiropractors found him guilty of the professional misconduct of
    sexual abuse, and imposed the mandatory certificate revocation. The Divisional Court
    set aside that decision as unreasonable, finding that the sexual abuse provisions
    were not intended to apply when the sexual relationship began before the
    chiropractor-patient relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      In my view, the Divisional Court erred in
    its interpretation of the zero-tolerance provisions and its application to the
    facts as found by the discipline committee. For the reasons that follow, I
    would restore the decision of the discipline committee.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is a chiropractor in Waterloo, Ontario
    and a member of the College since 1997. He and the complainant met in December
    2004 and began a personal relationship, which became a sexual relationship.
    They moved in together about mid-March 2005. In April 2005, the complainant switched
    chiropractors and commenced regular chiropractic treatments with the
    respondent. She received 28 treatments between April and October 2005, both at
    the clinic and at home. He billed her, and although she did not pay, he marked
    her bills as paid and she submitted them to her insurer for reimbursement. When
    she received the money from the insurer, she would pass it on to the
    respondent. When their personal relationship ended in October 2005, the
    respondent attempted to collect the balance owing for his chiropractic services
    of $567.00 from the complainant. When she refused to pay, he referred the
    account to a collection agency on November 17, 2005. When counsel for the
    complainant was unable to resolve the account matter with the respondent, she
    complained to the College. It was the College that determined that the
    respondent should be charged with sexual abuse.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Decision of the Discipline Committee</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two issues before the panel were whether the
    complainant was a patient of the respondent and if so, whether their sexual
    relationship occurred while she was his patient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The panel determined that the complainant was a patient
    of the respondent between April and October 2005. They noted that this was not
    disputed. They also listed the factors they relied on to confirm the
    chiropractor-patient relationship: the respondent opened a patient file that
    included a patient history, physical examination, diagnosis, plan of
    management, prognosis, diagnostic imaging reports, and a written record of
    treatments; he had the complainant complete an informed consent to treatment
    form; he commenced billing immediately; he wrote a letter for the complainant
    referring to her as his patient; he wrote a formal patient discharge letter; he
    recorded her information in financial records; he filed an insurance claim for
    orthotics for the complainant; he wrote a letter of consultation to the
    complainant’s primary physician; he made written statements to the complainant
    referring to her as his patient and his clinical patient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was also not disputed that the respondent and the
    complainant were in a sexual relationship during the time when she was his
    patient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The panel considered the respondent’s argument that
    because the sexual relationship began before the complainant became the respondent’s
    patient, the zero-tolerance/mandatory revocation policy should not apply. The
    panel rejected that argument. It found that the key concern in sexual abuse
    cases is the protection of the public and that concern applies no matter what
    the timing of the commencement of the patient relationship in relation to the
    sexual relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The panel referred in detail to the decisions of this
    court in <i>Mussani v. College of Physicians
    and Surgeons of Ontario</i> (2004), 74 O.R. (3d) 1 and  <i>Rosenberg
    v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i> (2006), 275 D.L.R. (4th)
    275. The panel adopted the reasoning and concerns of this court expressed in <i>Rosenberg</i>, that if discipline committees
    were to create a “spousal exemption”, they would be concerned with examining
    and deciding whether a relationship qualified as “spousal”, rather than
    focusing on “the central question posed by the legislation, namely, was there a
    concurrent sexual and physician-patient relationship”: see para. 42.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also argued before the panel that other
    chiropractors and health care professionals were treating spouses or partners
    and not being disciplined. The panel also rejected this argument. It found that
    the respondent was familiar with the prohibition against sexual involvement with
    a patient, but still proceeded to engage in a sexual relationship with his
    patient. It held that the fact that others in the profession may be engaging in
    the same conduct was not a defence to the respondent’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The panel also <span class=GramE>rejected</span> the
    respondent’s argument that because he was in an intimate relationship with the
    complainant before she became his patient, this was not a situation where she
    was vulnerable as a patient, nor was there a power imbalance between them in
    the circumstances. The panel found that there was a power imbalance and it
    arose from the co-existence of the sexual and chiropractor/patient
    relationship. This was born out first by an initial e-mail the respondent sent
    to the complainant before he accepted her as a patient: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The condition on you coming in as a patient is that
    you have to follow my advice. If you don’t that is ok, but then you will be
    discharged. I do treat it (<i>treatment</i>)
    separately and try to remain objective. [Exhibit 5 p. 120 April 1, 2005.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, at the end of their sexual and patient
    relationship, the respondent again misused his position as her chiropractor by
    sending her account to a collection agency. The panel concluded that the
    respondent did this not for the money but to cause his former partner emotional
    harm, and that his actions constituted an abuse of power that “exposes the
    vulnerability of the patient.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the panel recognized that it may appear that
    the strict and significant mandatory penalty that follows from a conviction for
    professional misconduct by sexual abuse is harsh and arguably unjust in cases
    where there is a consensual sexual relationship and no exploitation by the
    health care professional. However, the panel found that the importance of
    upholding the zero-tolerance policy outweighs its pitfalls because the
    legislation is there to address a growing problem of sexual abuse of patients
    by some health care professionals.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Reasons of the Divisional Court<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question the court had to determine on appeal by
    the chiropractor was whether the discipline committee’s decision that he was
    guilty of professional misconduct by sexual abuse under the <i>Health Professions Procedural Code</i> was
    an unreasonable one, because the respondent and the complainant were already in
    an intimate relationship before she became his patient. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court focused its analysis on the two
    recent Ontario Court of Appeal decisions that discuss the mandatory revocation provisions
    in the context of a spousal or similar relationship between the health care
    professional and the patient, <i>Mussani</i> and <i>Rosenberg</i>. The Divisional Court
    distinguished those cases from the present one on the basis of what it
    identified as the key factual difference that in this case, the sexual
    relationship began before the doctor/patient relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court stated at para. 30 that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The zero tolerance/mandatory revocation provisions
    were meant to target sexual activity that arises after a professional-patient
    relationship has been established. There is a risk of an abuse of power by the
    professional, as well as a risk that consent to sexual activity is tainted by
    the imbalance of power between the professional and the patient and the
    vulnerability of the patient (<i>Mussani</i> at para. 21).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court reasoned therefore, that treating one’s
    spouse while continuing a sexual relationship should not automatically trigger
    a finding of sexual abuse by the health care professional. Referring to the Court
    of Appeal decisions in <i>Mussani</i> and <i>Rosenberg</i>, the Divisional Court stated
    that “incidental” treatment of a spouse would be unlikely to make the
    practitioner guilty of sexual abuse.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue therefore turned on the definition of
    “incidental”. The court found that the discipline committee erred by
    interpreting “incidental” to refer to the frequency of treatment, so that if
    the practitioner provided regular treatment to the spouse, that would not be
    considered to be incidental. That interpretation, the Divisional Court held,
    was an unreasonable one. Rather, the court believed that the term “incidental
    medical care”, as used by the Court of Appeal, meant “care arising from or as
    an incident to the spousal relationship”, and did not refer to the frequency or
    regularity of treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, according to the Divisional Court, the test
    to be applied in a case where the health professional provides treatment to his
    or her spouse is “whether subsequent sexual activity arose out of the spousal
    relationship or out of the professional-patient relationship”.  The court concluded that because the
    discipline committee did not ask or answer that question, its decision in this
    case was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court further explained that the focus
    of the provisions is on the power imbalance that exists between a health care
    professional and his or her patient. The court reasoned that the power
    imbalance and consequent vulnerability of the patient “creates a risk that the
    patient’s consent to a sexual relationship will be tainted”.  As a result, the issue is “whether there is a
    power imbalance which renders the consent to sexual activity suspect”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case the court found there was no evidence
    suggesting that the complainant’s consent to sexual activity was suspect during
    the period she was a patient of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court also referred to two of the College’s written
    policies as supportive of its interpretation. In Standard of Practice S-014,
    “Prohibition <span class=GramE>Against</span> a Sexual Relationship with a
    Patient”, it states that: “Sexualizing a professional relationship is against
    the law.” The court noted that this document does not appear to address the
    situation where the patient relationship only arises after the sexual
    relationship. The court also noted that Policy P&#8209;040, “Insured Services <span
class=GramE>Under</span> OHIP”, does not prohibit the treatment of family
    members except in circumstances where the professional judgment or objectivity
    of the chiropractor is compromised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court summarized its decision by saying
    that because the discipline committee failed to consider the pre-existing
    intimate relationship between the respondent and the complainant before she
    became a patient, and the College’s policies regarding the treatment of family
    members, its decision that the respondent was guilty of sexual abuse of a
    patient was unreasonable. It therefore set aside the decision and the mandatory
    certificate revocation, and referred the matter back to the discipline
    committee for a new hearing.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)    Did the Divisional Court err in law in its

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the third decision of this court that has
    considered the intent and effect of the zero-tolerance/mandatory revocation
    provisions under the <i>Health Professions
    Procedural Code</i> for sexual abuse by a health care professional. In <i>Mussani</i> and <i>Rosenberg</i>, the court reviewed in detail the history leading up to
    the enactment of the provisions in 1993 by the legislature (and proclaimed in
    force on January 1, 1994), based on the recommendation made in the <i>Final Report of the Task Force on Sexual

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Blair J.A. in <i>Mussani</i> and Sharpe J.A. in <i>Rosenberg</i> listed
    the principal factors that led the Task Force to recommend the zero-tolerance/mandatory
    revocation policy. They bear repeating because they explain the context in
    which these provisions were considered and accepted by the legislature as an
    appropriate response to the increasing problem of sexual exploitation of
    patients by physicians at that time. I quote from the <i>Mussani</i> decision at paras. 20-23:</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote"><span
lang=EN-US>[20]     The Task Force recommended
    a policy of zero tolerance together with the mandatory revocation of a doctor’s
    licence as the appropriate means of dealing with the problem of sexual abuse of
    patients.  In formulating its
    recommendations, it consulted with patients, doctors, advocacy groups, and
    institutions such as the College.  During
    six months of hearings it received 303 detailed reports of sexual abuse.  It reviewed a number of studies that had
    examined incidents of sexual abuse by physicians, including a Canadian survey,
    which found that 8% of Ontario women reported sexual harassment or abuse by
    doctors.  The Task Force found ample
    evidence that sexual abuse by physicians was a serious societal problem.  </span></p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">[21]     Its recommendations for zero
    tolerance and mandatory revocation were founded upon a number of important
    findings and factors.  Principal amongst
    these were the following:</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">a)         the general vulnerability of patients in such relationships;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">b)         the power imbalance that almost invariably exists in favour of the practitioner,
    thus facilitating easy invasion of the patient’s sexual boundaries;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">c)         the privileged position of doctors in society, based on their education, status and
    access to resources;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">d)         the breach of trust entailed in such conduct by physicians;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">e)         the serious, long-term
    injury to the victim, both physical and emotional, that results from sexual
    abuse, including the harmful effects on future care caused by the victim’s
    inability to place her trust in other doctors and caregivers;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">f)          the fact that sexual abuse tarnishes public trust in the entire profession;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">g)         the results of an
    historical review by the Task Force of sanctioning decisions by the College’s
    Discipline Committee and the Divisional Court, which demonstrated a leniency
    that reflected “a profound non-appreciation of the harm done to victims”; and,</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">h)         the significant risk of recidivism by abusers, enhanced by the ineffectiveness of
    rehabilitation measures and previous restrictions on doctors’ practices in
    providing protection against the re-occurrence of abuse. [The Task Force on
    Sexual Abuse of Patients, <i>Final Report</i>,

    of the Divisional Court (reported as <i>Mussani
    v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 641)

  <p class="Doubleindent-quote"><span
lang=EN-US>[22]     The Task Force recommended
    that the penalty for “sexual violation” of a patient – i.e., any physical
    sexual conduct – be mandatory revocation of licence for five years. It
    acknowledged this was severe, but stated the sanction was justified based on
    the foregoing considerations and the members’ conclusion that doctors should be
    held to the highest standard of conduct and accountability in this area.</span></p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote"><span
lang=EN-US>[23]     In December 1991, an
    all-party resolution in the Legislature approved the findings and major
    recommendations of the Task Force, including the recommendation of a mandatory
    revocation scheme.  A year later, on
    November 25, 1992, the Minister of Health introduced Bill 100, amending the <i>Regulated
      Health Professions Act</i> to implement the recommendations.  It proposed the imposition of the mandatory
    revocation of licence in a somewhat narrower range of situations than envisaged
    by the Task Force.  Instead of revocation
    for all forms of sexual touching except kissing, as was recommended, Bill 100
    provided for the mandatory penalty only in cases of sexual intercourse and what
    the parties refer to as the “frank” forms of physical sexual relations listed
    in s.&nbsp;51(5) of the Code….</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Statement of Purpose, sexual abuse provisions</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the provisions of this Code with respect
    to sexual abuse of patients by members is to encourage the reporting of such
    abuse, to provide funding for therapy and counselling for patients who have
    been sexually abused by members and, ultimately, to eradicate the sexual abuse
    of patients by members.</p>

    of a patient, shall not be made earlier than,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) five years after the date on which the
    certificate of registration was revoked; or </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) six months after a decision has been made in a
    previous application under subsection (1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These provisions contain no exemption from either
    liability for sexual abuse or from the mandatory penalty where the health care
    professional and the patient are having sexual intercourse in the context of
    their relationship as spouses or are in a spousal-type relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rosenberg</i>,
    Sharpe J.A. summarized the effect of the provisions this way at para. 25:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The legislation, like the Task Force
    recommendations, is clear and unambiguous: when it comes to sexual relations
    between a doctor and a patient, there is a black letter, bright line
    prohibition with a drastic sanction and no exceptions or exemptions. The zero
    tolerance policy precludes inquiry into any explanation or excuse for the sexual
    activity. A patient’s consent is irrelevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the question of whether there should be a
    spousal exemption first arose in <i>Mussani</i> as a hypothetical situation to be considered in the context of the
    constitutional challenge to the provisions as overly broad. In the Divisional Court,
    Then&nbsp;J. considered the issue as one of interpretation of the term
    “patient” in the context of the provision. He doubted that a disciplinary
    tribunal would consider a physician’s spouse to be a patient “simply because [the]
    physician may have treated his or her spouse.<span class=GramE>”:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[152] <span
class=GramE>The</span> first proposed hypothetica<span style='color:black;'>l is the situation where a
    physician treats his or her spouse. &quot;Patient&quot; is not defined in the
    RHPA. This means that Discipline Committees and the courts must interpret the
    meaning of “patient” in the context of determining whether sexual activity
    occurred in the professional-patient relationship. It seems highly unlikely
    that tribunals or courts would interpret this term as including a physician's
    spouse. Neither the appellant nor the OMA provided a single disciplinary case
    in which the term “patient” was interpreted to include a physician's spouse.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black;
'>[153] Interpreting
    “patient” for the purposes of s. 51(5)2 of the Code as including a spouse would
    be an unreasonable interpretation of the legislation. The sanction in s. 51(5)2
    is ordered if “a panel finds a member has committed an act of professional
    misconduct by sexually abusing a patient.” It is far-fetched to characterize the intimate relationship between
    spouses as “sexual abuse” simply because a physician may have treated his or
    her spouse.<i></i></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black;
'>[154] ... The
    “zero tolerance” regime was adopted because of the power imbalance and
    relationship of trust between physician and patient. It was recognized that in
    these circumstances patient consent to such relationships was suspect and could
    seriously harm vulnerable patients. Prohibitions exist because of concern about
    the consequences for the mental and physical health of a patient who enters
    into an intimate relationship when vulnerable. These concerns are not present
    in the case of spouses. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Court of Appeal, Blair J.A. agreed that the
    issue would turn not on an exemption for spouses, but on whether in the
    circumstances there was a physician-patient relationship between them as well
    as a spousal relationship. In articulating his analysis, he introduced the
    concept of “incidental medical care” in the following passage at
    para.&nbsp;102:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While the spousal hypotheticals appear troubling at
    first blush, I agree with the conclusion of Then J.:  “It is far-fetched to characterize the
    intimate relationship between spouses as sexual abuse merely because a
    physician may have treated his or her spouse.” … The fact that during the
    course of a marriage a physician may provide incidental medical care to his or
    her spouse is unlikely, in my view, to establish a physician/patient
    relationship which would attract the discipline procedures of the Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rosenberg</i>,
    the doctor argued, relying on <span class=GramE><i>Mussani</i>, that</span> the zero&#8209;tolerance/mandatory certificate
    revocation provisions were not intended to apply to a doctor who treats a
    person with whom he is in a spousal-type relationship. In that case, the
    complainant had been a patient of the doctor for four years when they commenced
    a sexual relationship in 1992, prior to the enactment of zero-tolerance
    provisions, which took effect in 1994. By that time, they were living together
    and planned to marry, although he was still married to his wife. The doctor
    continued treating the complainant as a patient until 1998, when their personal
    relationship ended. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A., speaking for the court, rejected the doctor’s
    argument, stating at para.&nbsp;48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the decision of this court in <i>Mussani</i> indicates that the question is
    not to be approached on the basis of any categorical exclusion of spouses, but
    on the basis of whether or not a physician-patient relationship has been
    established, recognizing that it is unlikely that a physician-patient
    relationship will be established between a physician and his or her spouse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court found that the discipline committee had
    followed this approach and had <span class=GramE>found,</span> based on ample
    evidence, including a concession by the physician, that the complainant was his
    patient. In those circumstances, as the physician-patient relationship
    coincided with the sexual relationship between them, the physician was guilty
    of sexual abuse as defined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the discipline committee also followed
    that approach. Applying its expertise, and based on overwhelming evidence including
    the admission of the chiropractor, the panel found that the complainant was the
    respondent’s patient from April to October 2005, during the time they were in
    an intimate, sexual relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the Divisional Court objected to the
    approach taken by the discipline committee in deciding that the chiropractor
    and the complainant were in a professional-patient relationship. The court
    agreed that the complainant was a patient of the respondent “in the clinical
    sense”, based on the consent to treatment form, the numerous treatments and the
    clinical notes and records. The Divisional Court concluded, however, that that did
    not automatically determine whether there was sexual abuse of the patient
    within the meaning of the Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With great respect to the Divisional Court, in
    proceeding to impose a further requirement in order to find sexual abuse beyond
    the concurrence of a chiropractor-patient and a sexual relationship, the Divisional
    Court erred in law. The disciplinary offence of sexual abuse is defined in the Code
    for the purpose of these proceedings as the concurrence of a sexual
    relationship and a healthcare professional-patient relationship. There is no
    further inquiry once those two factual determinations have been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is some room for interpretation and application
    of the particular circumstances of a case in the committee’s determination of
    the second issue, whether the complainant was a patient of the chiropractor. As
    this court said in <i>Mussani</i> and <i>Rosenberg</i>, where incidental medical care,
    or for the purposes of this case, incidental chiropractic treatment is provided
    during the course of a spousal relationship, it is unlikely that the discipline
    committee will find that the spouse was a patient within the meaning of the
    Code. As the term “patient” is not defined in the Code, it is up to the
    discipline tribunal to apply its expertise in considering all the facts and
    circumstances in order to determine whether a complainant who was having a sexual
    relationship, including as a spouse, was also a patient of the health care
    professional and in that context, whether any medical care that was provided
    was merely “incidental” medical care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court interpreted this court’s
    references to “incidental” medical care of a spouse “to encompass care arising
    from or as an incident to the spousal relationship” (para. 34).  It viewed the inquiry into whether medical
    care was “incidental” as an exercise to determine whether the power imbalance
    in the doctor-patient relationship was used in the particular case to obtain
    consent to the sexual activity. To do that, it said, the discipline committee
    must decide whether, in a case where the sexual relationship preceded the
    medical care, the subsequent sexual activity “arose out of the spousal
    relationship or out of the professional-patient relationship” (para. 35).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, with respect to the Divisional Court, the
    inquiry it proposes fails to adequately heed the role and expertise of the
    discipline committee in interpreting and applying the zero-tolerance provisions
    of the Code, and attaches a meaning to the phrase “incidental medical care” which
    was not intended by this court in <i>Mussani</i> and <i>Rosenberg</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discipline committee of the College has expertise
    in professional conduct matters as they relate to chiropractic practice. Their
    expertise is not in spousal relations or dynamics, nor would it be fruitful,
    productive or relevant to the standards of the profession for the committee to
    investigate the intricacies of the sexual and emotional relationship between
    the professional and the complaint. That is why the Code has defined the
    offence in such a way that the fact of a sexual relationship and the fact of a
    doctor-patient relationship are what must be established. The first issue
    should be straightforward. The second requires consideration of a number of
    factors by the committee in the application of its expertise, as occurred in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “incidental” is defined in Black’s Law
    Dictionary as: subordinate to something of greater importance; having a minor role,
    and in the Oxford English Dictionary as: 1. Occurring or liable to occur in
    fortuitous or subordinate conjunction with something else of which it forms no
    essential part; casual….  These
    definitions, as well as others that are similar, indicate that the medical care
    that is referred to as incidental is minor in nature, casual, or arising in a
    fortuitous conjunction with the spousal relationship. Two examples of
    “incidental medical care” might be where a doctor and her spouse are in an
    accident and the doctor provides on the spot emergency care to her spouse, or a
    chiropractor’s spouse suffers a muscle spasm and the chiropractor performs a
    manipulation in order to provide immediate relief. It would be unreasonable for
    a spouse to be denied treatment in such circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court criticised the discipline
    committee for using the frequency of treatment as an indication of whether the
    treatment was “incidental”. Although the word “incidental” is not defined in
    terms of the frequency of what may occur, where medical treatment is provided
    on a regular basis by appointment in office, and where payment is expected, it
    is most unlikely that such treatment would be considered “incidental”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Divisional Court seems to have interchanged
    the concept of incidental medical treatment with incidental sexual activity.
    The court first stated that the concern of the Court of Appeal in using the
    term “incidental” was “whether the medical treatment arose as a result of or as
    an incident to the spousal relationship” (para. 34).  However, in the next paragraph, the Divisional
    Court reasoned that in a case where the medical treatment commenced after the
    sexual relationship was in place, the discipline committee must ask “whether
    subsequent sexual activity arose out of the spousal relationship or out of the
    professional-patient relationship” (para. 35).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court correctly identified the purpose
    of these provisions of the Code, which is to prevent a health care professional
    from being in a position to use the power imbalance between a doctor and
    patient to obtain consent to sexual activity. However, the offence is complete
    when a doctor is in a sexual relationship with a patient, regardless of whether
    there was any power imbalance in the particular case, and whether it was used
    in fact to obtain consent to sex.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue, therefore, is not whether the sexual
    activity is incidental to the professional relationship. The issue is whether
    the medical treatments were merely incidental to the spousal relationship and
    did not constitute the spouse as a patient, or whether they <span class=GramE>were
    of such a nature that the spouse was a patient</span> within the meaning of the
    Code. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I do not agree with the Divisional Court that
    the discipline committee erred by not referring to policies of the College
    relating to treating family members. To the contrary, the discipline committee
    made a specific finding that the respondent was aware that the rules of
    professional conduct prohibited him from engaging in a sexual relationship with
    a patient. Nevertheless, he apparently believed that once he and the
    complainant were living together, the rule did not apply to him. He had no
    basis for that belief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The College’s Standard of Practice S-014 specifically
    states: “Under no circumstances should a member have a sexual relationship with
    a current patient”, and “a sexual relationship with a patient is strictly
    forbidden by law.” Under the heading “Procedure”, the first bullet states:  “It is never appropriate to have a sexual
    relationship with a patient who is receiving active treatment. The professional
    relationship must be terminated”.  The
    fact that one line is phrased as “Sexualizing a professional relationship is
    against the law”, does not thereby limit the application of the rule or of the Standard
    to situations where the patient relationship preceded the sexual relationship.  I also note, that for further certainty the Standard
    states in bold: <b>Note to Readers: In the
    event of any inconsistency between this document and the legislation that
    affects chiropractic practice, the legislation governs.</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mussani</i> and in <i>Rosenberg</i>, this court observed
    that the application of the zero&#8209;tolerance/five-year mandatory revocation
    provisions might have been harsh, especially in circumstances where the parties
    appeared to be in a truly consensual relationship unrelated to their
    doctor-patient relationship. The same can be said here. However, as in those
    cases, the respondent could have avoided the entire problem, in this case
    simply by not starting to see the complainant as his patient after they moved
    in together.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the Divisional Court erred in law by
    imposing on a discipline committee the obligation to inquire into whether the
    sexual relationship of the parties arose out of their spousal relationship or
    their doctor-patient relationship in order to determine whether there was
    sexual abuse. The Code requires no such inquiry. The Divisional Court found the
    discipline committee’s finding of sexual abuse unreasonable because it did not
    apply that test and did not look at the College’s policy documents when
    assessing the issue. In my view, the discipline committee made no error in its
    interpretation or application of the Code, nor is there any basis to find its
    decision unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the
    decision of the Divisional Court and restore the decision of the discipline
    committee and the mandatory revocation of the certificate of the respondent,<b> </b>with costs of the appeal and of the
    appeal to the Divisional Court to the appellant fixed in the total amount of $30,000.</p>
