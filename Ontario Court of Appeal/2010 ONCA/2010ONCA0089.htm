  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Popert and a friend set fire to a house.  He pleaded guilty to arson and failure to
    comply with an undertaking, for which he was sentenced to nine months’
    imprisonment (15 days concurrent on the fail to comply conviction) and twelve
    months’ probation.  In addition, Mr.
    Popert was ordered to make restitution of $40,537.50 to the insurance company
    that had paid out monies due to the fire (the “restitution order”).  In this appeal against sentence, he asks that
    the restitution order be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tim and Gloria Doucet lived in a house in the village
    of Elmwood, Ontario.  Gretha Holmes is
    Tim Doucet’s mother.  She owned the
    property in which the Doucets lived.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the offence, Mr. Popert was 20 years old
    and unemployed.  He lived with Tim and
    Gloria Doucet, whom he knew through his stepfather.  Mr. Popert had known the Doucets for many
    years and saw them as parental figures.  Mr. Popert’s friend, Derek Wrightson, also lived with the Doucets.  The two young men were fed and housed by the
    Doucets in exchange for doing chores around the house.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Doucets were experiencing financial difficulties related
    to problems with the septic system in the house in which they lived.  Gloria Doucet, in the presence of her husband
    Tim Doucet, asked Messrs. Popert and Wrightson to burn down their house so that
    they could collect the insurance money.  They offered to pay for the arson but no dollar figure was discussed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 28, 2005, the Doucets left their home in
    Elmwood and went to Owen Sound.  Using a
    propane torch from the house, Messrs. Popert and Wrightson set fire to some
    furniture in the basement of the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the house was on fire, Mr. Wrightson called 9-1-1.  Firefighters arrived and put out the fire.  Although the house was not burnt to the
    ground, it suffered considerable damage.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Doucets pursued an insurance claim for contents
    damage, the cost of cleaning and repairing the house and belongings that had
    been damaged by the fire, and additional living expenses incurred because of the
    fire.  Gretha Holmes was the named
    insurance policy holder for the property.  As the named insured, payments were made to Ms. Holmes or to the
    companies that performed the cleaning services, but all of the insurance
    company’s dealings were with the Doucets.  Apparently most, if not all, of the $81,074<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> that the insurance company paid out in claims was made for the benefit of the
    Doucets.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Popert received no money for his part in the arson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Soon after the fire, Mr. Wrightson turned himself in to
    the police and confessed to his role in the arson.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Popert did the same
    thing.  He agreed to help the police by surreptitiously
    recording conversations with the Doucets.  He obtained some evidence for the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Popert was charged with arson, as were Mr.
    Wrightson and the Doucets.  Both Mr.
    Popert and Mr. Wrightson pleaded guilty to an offence under s. 434 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  They then testified as Crown witnesses
    against the <span class=SpellE>Doucets</span>.  I understand from counsel that the <span class=SpellE>Doucets</span> were convicted of arson but that no restitution orders were made against
    them.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Messrs. Popert and Wrightson were sentenced to nine months
    in prison and 12 months of probation.  As
    well, “stand-alone” restitution orders for $40,537.50 in favour of the
    insurance company were imposed on both.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge gave thorough reasons for imposing
    a jail term followed by probation.  In so
    doing, he considered Mr. Popert’s personal circumstances, which can be
    summarized as follows.  Mr. Popert was 20
    years old at the time of the offence.  He
    had no prior criminal record.  At the age
    of 15, he left his mother’s house after suffering verbal and physical abuse at
    the hands of his mother and stepfather.  From that point forward, he had no permanent residence.  He slept on the couches of relatives, friends
    and acquaintances in exchange for “helping out”.  He left school after grade 11.  At the time of the offence, he had a limited
    employment history, having been quickly fired from the </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE>only</span> jobs
    he had found.  He has a serious history
    of drug use; long-term regular marijuana use has negatively impacted on his
    ability to function in society.  At the
    time of sentencing, he had begun to receive social assistance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Very brief reasons were given for imposing the restitution
    order.  They read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition, they will comply with an order for
    restitution.  The clerk has handed me a
    note that the total loss to the insurance company is $81,074.  It seems to me that this is obviously a big
    sum and will [be] a major problem for each of them.  Neither one of them will be able to pay this
    as part of a probationary disposition.  So the restitution order will be a freestanding restitution order, which
    simply means it will act as a civil judgment against you.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not know what the outcome is going to be with
    respect to the other participants in this matter, but it seems to me, with
    respect to these two individuals, that the only proper way, at this stage of
    the proceedings, to deal with it is for it to be on the basis that they each
    share one half the responsibility for the loss.  That means each of them will be responsible for $40,537.50.  The Clerk will do the actual math and it may
    be a few pennies different than what I have just said.  That simply is a freestanding restitution order,
    and they will each be responsible for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Mr. Popert argues that the sentencing judge
    erred in making the restitution order because: 1) he did not receive any of the
    funds paid out by the insurance company or otherwise profit from the offence;
    and 2) it is unlikely that he will ever be in a position to pay such an
    amount.     </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the oral hearing of the appeal, the court asked for
    written submissions on whether the court had the power to make a restitution
    order in favour of an insurance company under s. 738(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Those submissions have now been received.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there are two issues to be resolved on
    this appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.  Can an insurance company be the subject of a restitution order under s.
    738(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.  Did the sentencing judge err in making the restitution order against Mr.
    Popert?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CAN AN INSURANCE COMPANY BE THE
    SUBJECT OF A RESTITUTION ORDER UNDER S. 738(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) OF
    THE <i>CRIMINAL CODE</i>?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The power to make a restitution order comes from s. 738(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The relevant part of s. 738(1) reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<i>Where an
    offender is convicted or discharged </i>under section 730 <i>of an offence</i>, <i>the court</i> imposing sentence on or discharging the offender <i>may</i>, on application of the Attorney General or on its own motion,
    in addition to any other measure imposed on the offender, <i>order that the offender</i> <i>make
    restitution to another person</i> as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <i>in
    the case of damage to, or the loss or destruction of, the property of any
    person as a result of the commission of the offence</i> or the arrest or
    attempted arrest of the offender, by paying to the person an amount not
    exceeding the replacement value of the property as of the date the order is
    imposed, less the value of any part of the property that is returned to that
    person as of the date it is returned, where the amount is readily
    ascertainable.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 653(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and s. 725(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as
    amended by R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1<sup>st</sup> supp.), s. 158, predecessors to
    s. 738(1), are relevant to the following discussion so are set out now.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 653(1) provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court that convicts an accused of an indictable
    offence may, upon the application of a person aggrieved, at the time sentence
    is imposed, order the accused to pay to that person an amount by way of
    satisfaction or compensation for loss of or damage to property suffered by the
    applicant as a result of the commission of the offence of which the accused is
    convicted.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 653(1) was replaced by s. 725(1), which in turn
    was replaced by s. 738(1).  Section
    725(1) provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court that convicts or discharges under section
    736 an accused of an offence may, on the application of a person aggrieved, at
    the time sentence is imposed, order the accused to pay to that person an amount
    by way of satisfaction or compensation for loss of or damage to property
    suffered by that person as a result of the commission of the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the appellant and the Crown acknowledge that the
    courts have made restitution orders in favour of insurance companies based on
    s. 738(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Code</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Both also submit that the court has the power
    to make such orders.  However, they offer
    different views as to the nature and scope of that power.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that an insurance company is not
    a person with property that has been lost or damaged as a result of an offence.  However, based on the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Fitzgibbon</i>, [1990]
    1 S.C.R. 1005 and Ontario legislation regulating the insurance industry, the
    appellant says that an insurance company may acquire an entitlement to a restitution
    order under s. 738(1)(a) through subrogation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Fitzgibbon</i>,
    it was argued that the Law Society of Upper Canada was not <span class=GramE>an</span> “person aggrieved” and, therefore, was not entitled to a restitution order under
    s. 653(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, despite
    the fact that the Law Society had made compensation to the victims of the offences.  The Supreme Court of Canada rejected this argument.  At pp. 1018-19, Cory J. writing for the
    court, said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the outset, it should be observed that one of
    the goals and aims of s. 653 was to provide a convenient, rapid and inexpensive
    means of recovery for the victim. Why should a victim of crime in a situation
    where the amount involved is readily ascertained and acknowledged by the
    accused be forced to undertake the often slow, tedious and expensive civil
    proceedings against the very person who has stolen from or defrauded the
    victim?  The Law Society has attempted to
    simplify the task for the defrauded client and to provide a sure and speedy
    means of repayment.  Upon proof of the
    victim’s claim, the Law Society makes payment on behalf of the dishonest solicitor.  The policy of the Law Society flows from
    sound and responsible provisions found in the <i>Law Society</i> <i>Act</i>.  By these provisions all lawyers recognize and
    accept responsibility for the acts of their dishonest colleagues.  The Law Society should not be penalized for
    compensating the defrauded clients.  Based on common law principles and for sound policy reasons, the Law
    Society should be subrogated to the rights of the defrauded clients which it
    has compensated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As well, the <i>Law
    Society Act</i> itself provides that the Law Society is to be subrogated to the
    rights of the victim … </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For these reasons, the Law Society is properly
    entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the victim and was entitled to be
    named as the beneficiary of the compensation order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 152(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, is an equivalent subrogation
    section for fire insurance claims.  It
    provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>152(1) <span class=GramE>The</span> insurer, upon
    making a payment or assuming liability therefor under a contract to which this
    Part applies, is subrogated to all rights of recovery of the insured against
    any person, and may bring action in the name of the insured to enforce such
    rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the reasoning in <i>Fitzgibbon</i> and s. 152(1) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, the appellant submits that the court has the power to make a
    restitution order in favour of an insurance company that has indemnified a
    person whose property was damaged, lost or destroyed as a result of the
    commission of an offence.  However, as that
    power is based on subrogation, it is limited in two ways.  First, a restitution order can be made only
    if the recipient of the insurance money would him or herself have a valid claim
    for restitution.  Second, the restitution
    order is limited to the cost of repairing or replacing the lost property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the appellant says that the first
    condition is not met.  The insurance
    claims were submitted by, and paid primarily for the benefit of, Tim and Gloria
    Doucet.  But it was Tim and Gloria Doucet
    who asked the appellant to burn down their home.  As the Doucets were ultimately responsible
    for the arson, they would have no right to claim restitution from the appellant
    for the damages they suffered as a result of the fire.  Accordingly, there was no valid claim that
    could pass from the Doucets to the insurance company by way of subrogation and
    no restitution order could be made in its favour.  Instead, the appellant contends, the
    insurance company’s recourse lies solely against the Doucets, who caused its loss
    by filing fraudulent claims.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown shares the appellant’s view, based on <span
class=GramE><i>Fitzgibbon</i>, that</span> a
    restitution order can be made in favour of an insurance company through
    subrogation of a victim’s rights.  It
    notes that the Manitoba Court of Appeal relied on <i>Fitzgibbon</i> in ruling that a restitution order could be made in favour
    of the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation: see <i>R. v. Scott</i> (2003), 180 Man. R. (2d) 198.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it submits that there is a second basis on
    which the court has jurisdiction to make such orders.  It contends that s. 738(1)(a) can be read as empowering
    the court to make such orders if the insurance company is seen as a victim of
    the offence.  The insurance company is a
    “person”. “Property” is defined broadly in s. 2<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and clearly
    includes money.  Thus, the money paid out
    as a result of the insurance claims arising from the arson can be seen to be the
    “loss” of “property” of a “person” that occurred “as a result of the commission
    of the offence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In making this submission, the Crown refers to <i>R. v. Ticknovich</i> (2003), 356 A.R. 57 (Q.B.).  In that case, Ms. Ticknovich was convicted of
    numerous counts of fraud.  The Crown
    sought a restitution order under s. 738(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) in
    favour of the Alberta Treasury Branch.  Ms.
    Ticknovich argued that the Treasury Branch was not a victim because it had not
    been mentioned in the indictment.  Justice
    Watson rejected that submission and imposed a restitution order for $110,000,
    the amount paid out by the Treasury Branch as a result of the fraud, plus
    interest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the interpretation urged by the Crown, the relevant
    parts of s. 738(1) would read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) … the court … may… order that the offender make
    restitution to another person as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>in</span> the case of …
    the loss … of… property of any person as a result<i> </i>of the commission of the offence …<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept the Crown’s submission on the interpretation to
    be given to s. 738(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a).  Accordingly, in my view, the court’s
    jurisdiction to make the restitution order rests on the words of s. 738(1)(a)
    itself, as well as on subrogation.  Thus,
    assuming that the appellant is correct and the court did not have the power to
    make the restitution order if its jurisdiction is based on subrogation, in my
    view the court nonetheless had that power based on the wording of s. 738(1)(a).  I reach this conclusion on the interpretation
    to be afforded s. 738(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on a plain reading of s. 738(1)(a), its scope is
    not restricted to persons whose property has been directly damaged, lost or
    destroyed as a result of an offence.  Section 738(1) empowers the court to order restitution to “another
    person” in the case of damage, loss or destruction of the property of “any
    person”.  This is to be contrasted with the
    predecessor provisions (ss. 653(1) and 725(1)), which limited the court to
    making compensation orders in favour of the person whose property had been lost
    or damaged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I see no reason in principle to interpret the
    scope of s. 738 narrowly so as to limit it to persons whose property has been directly
    damaged, lost or destroyed as a result of an offence.  As the Crown notes, unduly limiting s. 738(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) could denude the section of its force, given the
    pervasive presence of insurance in modern society.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, this interpretation accords with a purposive
    reading of s. 738(1).  The purpose of s.
    738(1) is to provide a “convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> for victims.  The insurance company is,
    in a very real sense, a victim of the arson.  Just as the Supreme Court recognized in <i>Fitzgibbon </i>that the Law Society should not be penalised for having
    compensated defrauded clients, so too insurance companies should not be
    penalized for having compensated insured persons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the insurance company is seen as a victim of the
    offence, the amount it paid out because of the arson is the “loss” of
    “property”. However, that does not necessarily mean that a restitution order
    can be made under s. 738(1) for any and all monies that the insurance company
    paid out as a result of the offence.  Questions
    arise about the quantification of such orders.  For example, can a restitution order in favour of an insurance company
    be for an amount greater than the “replacement value of the property”?  Can interest be included in such orders?<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Are payments that have been made for living
    expenses, such as in this case, properly considered for the purposes of
    restitution orders or are the orders limited to the costs of repairing and
    replacing goods that have been damaged or destroyed?  As I explain below, in my view the
    restitution order should be set aside.  Accordingly,
    I leave any questions of quantification that might arise to be decided in cases
    in which they have been squarely raised and argued.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of these questions, one might be concerned
    that a purposive interpretation of s. 738(1) will lead to the imposition of restitution
    orders for losses that are not sufficiently proximate to the offence.  That concern is met in two ways.  First, an application for a restitution order
    under s. 738(1) may be brought only by the Attorney General or on the court’s
    own motion.  The situation under both ss.
    653(1) and 725(1) was quite different as those provisions entitled any “person
    aggrieved” to make an application for a compensation order.  Second, restitution orders are discretionary.  The discretionary nature of the power coupled
    with the principles that govern their making (discussed in the following
    section) are adequate to ensure that restitution orders are fair and appropriate.  If a court is concerned that some or all of a
    “loss” is not sufficiently causally connected to the offence, it may refuse to
    make the order or adjust its quantum.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude on this issue by observing that a very
    real benefit flows from a purposive interpretation of s. 738(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a).  Restitution
    orders are not a substitute for civil proceedings nor are they intended to
    displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure full compensation to
    victims:  see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Zelensky</span> </i>(1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d)
    97.  Rather, restitution orders are one
    factor to be considered when deciding the total sentence to be imposed on an
    offender.  Their role was described in <i>Fitzgibbon</i><a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a> in the following way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In appropriate cases, compensation orders provide
    an extremely useful and effective tool in the sentencing procedure.  The order can provide flexibility and
    sensitivity to the ever difficult task of sentencing.  It can be an effective means of
    rehabilitating the accused because this order quickly makes him directly
    responsible for making restitution to the victim. … The order also benefits the
    victim by providing a speedy and inexpensive manner of recovering the
    debt.  … Society as a whole benefits from
    the order since its imposition may reduce the term of imprisonment and provides
    for the reintegration of the convicted person as a useful and responsible
    member of the community at the earliest possible date.  The practical efficacy and immediacy of the
    order will help to preserve the confidence of the community in the legal
    system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like any other aspect of sentencing, the focus must
    remain on the offence and the offender – it ought not to be shifted to
    complicated accounting issues.  Restitution orders made on the basis of subrogation run a greater risk
    of that shift in focus.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DID THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERR IN
    IMPOSING THE RESTITUTION ORDER?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Restitution orders are discretionary and, as such, are
    entitled to deference.<a href="#_ftn7"

'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  As this court has repeatedly stated, the
    ability of an offender to make restitution is an important factor that must be
    considered before a restitution order is imposed: see, for example, <i>R. v. Biegus </i>(1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 245
    at para. 15.  As Feldman J.A. explains in
    para. 15 of <span class=SpellE><i>Biegus</i></span>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A restitution order made by a sentencing court
    survives any bankruptcy of the accused:  <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. B-3, s. 178(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a).  Therefore, it is there for life.  It is not intended to be such a burden that
    it may affect the prospects for rehabilitation of the accused.  That is why ability to pay is one of the
    factors which the court must consider.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider
    the appellant’s ability to pay.  While
    the reasons suggest that the sentencing judge was alert to the appellant’s
    inability to pay, there was no attempt to address why that fact was irrelevant
    in imposing the order.  The court was
    faced with a 22-year-old young man with no employment history, no assets and no
    employable skills, who was surviving on social assistance and the charity of
    others.  In the circumstances, the appellant
    did not have the means to pay a restitution order in excess of $40,000 and it
    seems unlikely that he ever will be in such a position.  It also appears likely that an order of this
    magnitude would place such a burden on the appellant that it will likely impair
    his chances of rehabilitation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, when more than one person is involved in
    the commission of an offence, other considerations must be taken into account
    in order to ensure that imposition of a restitution order on a given offender does
    not “work <span class=GramE>an unfairness</span> as between the perpetrators”.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  In the present case, those considerations include
    that the insurance company’s loss is primarily attributable to the Doucets, who
    initiated the arson scheme, pursued the insurance claim and received the
    benefit of the insurance money; apparently no restitution order was made
    against the Doucets; and, the appellant received no money for his role in the
    offence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A restitution order is one factor in the total
    punishment imposed on an offender.  When all
    of the relevant factors are considered, it seems to me that the appellant – a
    youthful first offender – has been adequately punished for his role in the
    offence by the sentence he received.  Imposition of the restitution order would work <span class=GramE>an
    unfairness</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of these reasons, I would set aside the
    restitution order rather than, as the Crown urged, reduce its size.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence,
    allow the appeal and set aside the restitution order.</p>
