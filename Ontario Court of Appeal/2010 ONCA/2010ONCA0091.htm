  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for fraud.  The charge alleged that the appellant, by
    deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defrauded the public of income tax
    and G.S.T. payments owing by three corporations to Her Majesty the Queen by
    causing the companies to fail to report taxable income and supplies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave carefully considered,
    comprehensive and cogent reasons for conviction at the conclusion of what
    undoubtedly was a protracted and difficult trial.  The trial judge summarized his essential
    findings at para. 315 of his reasons for conviction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on the foregoing considerations, a review of
    the entirety of the trial record and application of the criminal standard of
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I conclude the evidence presented establishes
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.   Through the
    operation of <span class=SpellE>Treesann</span> Management Inc. from March 1,
    1997 to February 28, 1999 and the operation of 1038345 and later 1246434
    Ontario Limited from October 1, 1996 through October 31, 1998 the accused
    controlled Bunnies and Fantasia.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.   During the
    specified time frames referenced in the information Bunnies and Fantasia
    generated taxable income and taxable supplies subject to G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3.   Income tax returns
    were not filed by the named corporations and tax owing was not paid.  <i>I
    conclude the non-filing of the T2 corporate tax return was a consequence of the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> deliberate inaction.</i>  As an action oriented manager with a penchant
    for detail, I conclude, there is no justification for non-filing in spite of
    the various intervening circumstances referenced by the defence.  <i>Further,
    on the basis of the totality of evidence presented here the Crown has
    established, on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that any
    subsequently filed T2 return would have been founded on fraudulent income data.</i>  Given the fact the accused never subsequently
    revealed the true state of his economic affairs to his own financial
    controller, the individual who would have prepared source financial information
    for filing purposes, <i>the only available
    inference is that the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> intention to deceive
    continued long past the events of September 10, 1998.</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>4.   <i>The accused intentionally used deceit,
    falsehood and other fraudulent means to place the public economic interest at
    risk by intentionally directing the diversion of revenue for the purpose of
    ultimately undervaluing the taxable income of the named corporations.</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>5.   <i>The public economic interest was placed at
    risk by the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> making of false G.S.T. filings,
    failure to file G.S.T. returns and failing to file T2 Income Tax returns.</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>6.   The intentional
    dishonest acts of the accused to conceal and divert significant revenues
    constitute acts of dishonestly and deception designed to defraud the public of
    income taxes and services net taxes in the amount of at least $3,492,415
    rightfully due and owing to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. [Emphasis
    added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that these findings do not
    constitute fraud because no false or fraudulent document or return was uttered
    and no deceit was actually practised by the appellant.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant did cause the corporations he
    controlled to file false G.S.T. returns.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as the trial judge found, <i>R. v. Olan, Hudson and Hartnett</i> (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 145 (S.C.C.)
    and <i>R. v. Theroux</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C.
    (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) establish that the element of deprivation is made out by
    proof of detriment, prejudice or risk of prejudice to the economic interest of
    the victim caused by the dishonest act.  While
    no income tax returns were filed, the appellant’s dishonest acts in creating
    false records and destroying records and in deliberately failing to file
    returns made it impossible for the corporations to comply with their legal duty
    to file income tax returns. The dishonest acts of the appellant imperilled the
    public purse and caused a significant risk of deprivation that constitutes
    fraud as defined by <i>R. v. Olan</i> and <i>R. v. Theroux</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, we see no merit in the submission that the count
    was improperly framed as a fraud on “the public”, particularly when the portion
    of the charge containing those words is read as a whole: “defraud the public of
    income taxes and goods and services net taxes owing to Her Majesty the Queen in
    Right of Canada”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the argument relating to 1038345 Ontario
    Limited advanced in the factum, was not advanced at trial, was not pursued in
    oral argument and, in any event, we see no merit in it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also seeks leave to appeal his sentence
    of six years imprisonment and a fine of $2,000,000 with one year additional in
    default of payment.  This was a very
    significant fraud involving over $3,000,000.  The sentence was not outside the acceptable range and the trial judge’s
    reasons reveal no error of principle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is
    dismissed, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal against sentence
    is dismissed.</p>
