  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal challenges two decisions made in a family law
    case, one the disposition of a motion made at the beginning of trial and the
    other the disposition of the proceeding after trial.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the opening of trial, the respondent wife, Felicia
    Purcaru, brought a motion to strike the pleadings of the appellant husband, Dan
    Purcaru, alleging multiple, continuing and egregious breaches of various
    non-depletion, non-disposition and restraining orders.  After hearing oral evidence about the alleged
    breaches, the trial judge struck Mr. Purcaru’s pleadings and financial
    statements and precluded him from participating in the trial other than as an
    observer.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately after giving his ruling, the trial judge began
    the trial and heard evidence from Ms. Purcaru and her expert.  He granted Ms. Purcaru a divorce and monetary
    relief. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in the unusual circumstances of this case,
    it was open to the trial judge on the motion to exercise his discretion to
    strike Mr. Purcaru’s pleading and thereby restrict his participation at trial.  In deciding to do so, the trial judge was
    cognizant of the proper principles and the severity of the sanction he imposed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before exercising his discretion, the trial judge gave Mr.
    Purcaru the opportunity to consult counsel.  He ensured that Mr. Purcaru understood the difference between a motion
    to strike pleadings and a contempt motion and that the former could well
    operate to deprive him of an opportunity to present his case.  To prevent such an outcome, the trial judge
    repeatedly suggested to Mr. Purcaru that he remedy or explain his defaults. Mr.
    Purcaru was also familiar with motions to strike because Ms. Purcaru had
    brought several similar motions during the nearly five preceding years of
    litigation.  In light of Mr. Purcaru’s
    denial of wrongdoing, his intransigence and all the other circumstances, there
    was ample evidence for the trial judge to conclude that, despite his
    protestations, Mr. Purcaru would neither remedy his misconduct nor comply with
    his disclosure obligations.  On the basis
    of Mr. Purcaru’s misconduct, the trial judge was entitled to impose a remedy
    that would provide a strong disincentive against breaching court orders.  At some stage, this type of extreme
    misconduct will result in the loss of the recalcitrant litigant’s right to
    participate in the proceedings.  The
    trial judge decided that it did in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the trial judge noted that Mr. Purcaru’s
    participation at trial would only prolong the trial proceedings and, in
    fairness to Ms. Purcaru, the only appropriate remedy was to strike Mr.
    Purcaru’s pleadings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge explained his decision this way: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The likelihood that any realistic light would be
    shone on the matters in issue if the [husband] continues in my view is so slim
    as to be unrealistic. My preference would be to have both parties participate
    so that a correct factual determination could be made as to the assets to be
    divided and the appropriate level of child and spousal support in arrears, if
    any, to be fixed and calculated. But without a willing participant, the chances
    of doing that are nil.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was appropriate for the motion judge to
    impose the extreme sanction of denying Mr. Purcaru trial participation.  I also am not persuaded that the trial judge
    made any reviewable error in the corollary relief he granted to Ms. Purcaru at
    the conclusion of the trial.  Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties apparently cohabited for some time before
    marriage and were married for 7.5 years.  They separated in 2003.  They had
    two children.  Their daughter, now aged
    10, was born with significant medical problems that required major surgery and
    ongoing care, particularly during her early years.  She is now able to fully engage in life,
    although she will have permanent medical issues that will require
    monitoring.  The parties’ son is now age
    7.  Both children are doing well,
    including academically.  They are in
    their mother’s custody with the father’s consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru and Ms. Purcaru, who are age 44 and 37
    respectively, are well-educated and successful computer analysts and
    consultants.  After their immigration to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ,
    the parties started a computer consulting company.  In 2002, Ms. Purcaru began, and subsequently
    obtained, her Masters of Business Administration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties’ post-separation litigation began in
    September 2004, when Ms. Purcaru applied for a divorce and corollary
    relief.  The litigation was both
    acrimonious and protracted with numerous court attendances and interlocutory
    orders.  In the course of the interlocutory
    motions, Ms. Purcaru repeatedly alleged that Mr. Purcaru had substantial
    unreported income and assets.  There were
    many disclosure problems.  A June 2008
    trial date was adjourned.  The same month,
    Mr. Purcaru attempted suicide.  Also
    during 2008, Mr. Purcaru undertook studies at the University of Toronto for a
    MBA and graduated in April 2009. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         The proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly before the scheduled June 2008 trial date, Ms.
    Purcaru changed her expert accountant to Mr. DeBresser of Marmer Penner.  Mr. DeBresser composed a list of dozens of
    disclosure questions for Mr. Purcaru to answer, which were in addition to those
    that were already outstanding.  At Ms.
    Purcaru’s request, and with the consent of then counsel for Mr. Purcaru, the
    June 2008 trial date was adjourned.  The
    adjournment gave Mr. Purcaru a further opportunity to complete his disclosure
    and to retain his own accounting expert.  He was also given the opportunity to deliver an expert’s report, provided
    he did so by October 15, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 18, 2008, Mr. Purcaru was admitted to hospital
    following his attempted suicide.  He was
    diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  Further medical investigation revealed a brain “lesion in his parietal
    lobe”.   After his release from hospital,
    Mr. Purcaru was treated with anti-depressants, initially by his family doctor
    and then by a psychiatrist.  The
    psychiatrist, Dr. Canella, explained that a MRI suggested that Mr. Purcaru “suffers
    from either a slow-growing tumor or demylenation” that was likely responsible for
    some of his symptoms.  For many months,
    Mr. Purcaru pursued medical advice about his brain lesion, including opinions
    from doctors in his country of origin,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Romania</st1:country-region>
    .  Eventually, Mr. Purcaru came to accept the
    consistent advice of his Canadian doctors that his lesion required observation,
    but not surgery.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru filed numerous financial statements during
    the five years preceding trial.   Those
    statements raised more questions than they answered.  They also failed to include significant
    assets.  In particular, Mr. Purcaru’s
    early statements failed to disclose his 2005 acquisition of an interest in two
    properties on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Gloucester Street
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  His later statements failed to disclose that
    he had obtained an interest in a third
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gloucester
    Street property.  Ms. Purcaru only
    learned of these acquisitions through property searches conducted on her
    behalf. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru also fell far short of his disclosure
    obligations.  He did not provide an expert
    report by the October 2008 deadline.  Two
    months after the deadline, Herman J. wrote an endorsement in which she observed
    that Mr. Purcaru’s explanation was that he could not afford to retain an expert.
     Nonetheless, by the time of the trial in
    May 2009, Mr. Purcaru had retained an expert and sought to rely on his expert’s
    evidence, although still without appropriate supporting documentation for the
    expert’s opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During 2006, 2007, and 2008, the court had issued a
    total of four non-depletion and restraining orders against Mr. Purcaru.  Mr. Purcaru’s breaches of these orders became
    glaringly obvious on the eve of the May 2009 trial date, when he filed a
    further financial statement.  In that
    statement, he disclosed for the first time that he had obtained a $500,000 line
    of credit secured against his interest in the Gloucester Street property.  At trial, Mr. Purcaru testified that he
    applied for the line of credit in April 2008 (although post-trial material
    suggests it may have been as late as May 5).  Mr. Purcaru apparently used the proceeds of the line of credit to repay
    his former girlfriend a “loan” of $165,000 in June 2008 and to “lend” his
    brother in Romania $325,000 in September 2008.  In addition, Mr. Purcaru’s updated financial statement demonstrated that
    he removed approximately $97,000 from his RRSPs between January and May 2009.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         The motion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of Mr. Purcaru’s trial financial
    statement, counsel for Ms. Purcaru sought and obtained a brief recess in order
    to serve a motion to strike Mr. Purcaru’s pleadings and his financial
    statements as well as a motion for contempt.  After much discussion, the contempt motion was
    adjourned until after the trial.  We are told
    that it has now been further adjourned pending disposition of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before hearing the motion to strike, the trial judge
    ensured that Mr. Purcaru appreciated the potentially serious consequences of
    his conduct and that he was aware that he could and should retain counsel. In
    addition, the trial judge repeatedly suggested that Mr. Purcaru could remedy
    any breach by paying money into court.  Despite these cautions, Mr. Purcaru indicated that he was prepared to
    proceed with the motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Mr. Purcaru and his recently retained expert chartered
    accountant then gave oral testimony, which was confined to the issue of the
    breaches of the non-depletion and restraining orders.   In his testimony on the motion, Mr. Purcaru
    acknowledged that he was present when some or all of the orders at issue were
    pronounced.  He was also represented by
    counsel when certain of the orders were granted.   Despite his awareness of the court orders, and
    his significant level of education and sophistication, Mr. Purcaru testified
    that he did not appreciate the encompassing nature of the orders or the meaning
    of the word “encumber”.   In his view, as
    long as his total current assets exceeded the value of his assets at the time
    of separation, he had not contravened the orders.   It was his position that he was entitled to
    change the financial mix of his asset position as he saw fit, including by
    lending $325,000 to his brother overseas and by paying the alleged debt to his
    former girlfriend.   The testimony given
    by Mr. Purcaru’s expert did not assist the court concerning the breaches of the
    court orders.  This was in part because Mr.
    Purcaru apparently had not provided the expert with all the source documents
    necessary to evaluate his assets and liabilities properly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On ample evidence, the trial judge concluded that Mr.
    Purcaru had “defied the court orders to the detriment of the [Ms. Purcaru]” and
    that he had attempted to conceal his substantial breaches until the eve of
    trial.  This conclusion is not challenged
    on appeal.  The remedy is challenged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing the appropriate remedy for Mr. Purcaru’s
    egregious misconduct, the trial judge took into account Mr. Purcaru’s failure
    to remedy his breaches, the dim prospect of future disclosure, and the impact of
    his continuing non-disclosure.  In the
    trial judge’s view, the approach Mr. Purcaru was taking to the case was
    unproductive and unhelpful and his decision not to retain counsel, despite the
    clear need to do so and his ability to <span class=GramE>pay,</span> would
    result in the unnecessary prolongation of the trial.  Moreover, Mr. Purcaru’s trial participation would
    serve no useful purpose; it would only increase the costs for Ms. Purcaru.  It is in these circumstances that the trial
    judge precluded Mr. Purcaru from participating in the trial other than as an
    observer. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         The trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial proceeded immediately after the ruling on the
    motion to strike.  Ms. Purcaru
    testified.  She relied upon the contents
    of her application and her affidavits of June 26, 2008.  She testified about her children’s
    circumstances.  She said that she had
    provided all her books and records relevant to their expenses to Mr.
    DeBresser.  She also testified about a
    tax liability, of which she said Mr. Purcaru’s share was $140,000.  She attested that the liability arose from
    Mr. Purcaru’s failure to declare part of the parties’ corporate income and that
    he diverted the money from the company to himself without Ms. Purcaru’s
    knowledge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. DeBresser’s evidence was brief.  He relied on his reports and worksheet
    calculations.   He explained how he
    arrived at values for Mr. Purcaru’s assets, liabilities and income in the
    absence of disclosure.  As an example,
    Mr. DeBresser explained that he was unable to account for the source of $82,000
    of the $469,000 that Mr. Purcaru paid for the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Gloucester Street properties in
    2005.  In the absence of any explanation
    from Mr. Purcaru, Mr. DeBresser attributed the $82,000 to him as an undisclosed
    asset at the 2003 date of separation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. DeBresser’s evidence benefitted Mr. Purcaru in one
    respect.  In his opinion, Mr. Purcaru
    overstated the value of his companies in his 2005 financial statements and the
    consulting companies, in fact, had no value.  He took this opinion into account in arriving at the amount of an
    equalization payment, which after subsequent adjustments, totalled
    $165,840.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. DeBresser also testified about his calculations for
    child support, including section 7 expenses.  Those calculations were based on Mr. Purcaru’s income for the relevant
    years: $493,000 in 2005; $227,000 in 2006, and $626,000 in 2007.  These figures were based on the amounts in
    Mr. Purcaru’s income tax returns, which were adjusted by Mr. DeBresser to take
    into account his opinion concerning Mr. Purcaru’s actual expenditures and his
    unreported cash income.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the absence of disclosure from Mr. Purcaru regarding
    his income in 2008 and 2009, Mr. DeBresser attributed income to him of $626,000
    for 2008 and $350,000 for 2009, which were figures provided to him by Ms.
    Purcaru’s counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. DeBresser acknowledged that he had no information
    upon which to estimate Mr. Purcaru’s current income for the purpose of
    calculating ongoing child support.   However,
    he also testified that counsel’s estimate of $350,000 accorded with the
    $325,000 that Mr. Purcaru lent his brother.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In explaining his retrospective spousal support
    calculations, Mr. DeBresser used Ms. Purcaru’s income from her tax
    returns.  He concluded that her income
    was $96,351 in 2003; $75,155 in 2004; $147,254 in 2005; $189,912 in 2006; $101,500
    in 2007, and $130,000 in 2008.  He
    estimated her 2009 income at $130,000.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. DeBresser pointed out that, in light of the parties’
    relative incomes in 2004 and 2006, no spousal support was due for those
    years.  Based on the parties’ incomes in
    the remaining years, and using the 2009 estimated income of $350,000 for Mr.
    Purcaru and $130,000 for Ms. Purcaru, and applying the calculations provided by
    Ms. Purcaru’s counsel, Mr. DeBresser arrived at a lump sum figure of $227,256
    for retrospective spousal support.  Ms.
    Purcaru did not pursue a claim for prospective spousal support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In explaining his disposition, the trial judge stated
    that he awarded Ms. Purcaru the amounts requested “based on the evidence of Mr.
    DeBresser and the [respondent’s] testimony”.  He stated that he was satisfied theirs was the “best evidence possible
    in the circumstances.”  The trial judge
    accepted, in arriving at his opinion, that Mr. DeBresser was required to make
    judgment calls and assumptions, which the trial judge characterized as “conservative”,
    regarding Mr. Purcaru’s worth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the trial judge ordered Mr. Purcaru to
    pay Ms. Purcaru $7,534 in monthly child support, inclusive of section 7
    expenses; $165,840 as an equalization payment; $140,000 for his share of the
    tax obligation; $518,481 in arrears of child support, including section 7
    expenses and prejudgment interest; $240,506 in retrospective spousal support,
    also inclusive of prejudgment interest; and costs. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, Mr. Purcaru pursued the following
    grounds of appeal alleging that the trial judge erred on the motion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         The
    striking of Mr. Purcaru’s pleadings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru’s counsel on appeal does not argue that Mr.
    Purcaru did not deplete his assets.   Indeed, counsel properly concedes that Mr. Purcaru was in breach of the
    non-depletion and restraining orders made by the Superior Court.  He also wisely concedes that the breaches
    were both egregious and caused serious prejudice by compromising Mr. Purcaru’s
    ability to meet his obligations to Ms. Purcaru and their children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Mr. Purcaru challenges the disposition of the
    motion for three reasons.  First, he
    argues that his proposed fresh evidence demonstrates that he was unaware at the
    time of trial that his medical condition was a relevant consideration to bring
    to the attention of the trial judge.  Second, he explains his egregious misconduct on the basis of his mental
    condition.  Finally, he argues that the
    trial judge should have fashioned a remedy for his breaches that fell short of
    striking his pleadings and precluding his participation in the trial.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            (a)       The fresh evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first and second grounds of appeal rely on the
    proposed fresh evidence comprised of affidavits and psychiatric reports from Mr.
    Purcaru’s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Canella, and an experienced forensic
    psychiatrist, Dr. Julian Gojer.  The
    psychiatric opinions attempt to attribute Mr. Purcaru’s breaches, and his alleged
    failure to raise his mental condition at trial, to his depression and the
    diagnosis of a brain lesion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We permitted Mr. Purcaru to argue the appeal on the
    basis of the fresh evidence, subject to our subsequent determination about its
    admissibility.  After considering the
    fresh evidence, I am of the view that it is inadmissible, primarily because it
    is unreliable and its admission would not affect the result.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for the admissibility of fresh evidence is set
    out in <i>R v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    759 at 775<b>:</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have
    been adduced at trial ...;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>The evidence must be relevant in the

'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>The evidence must be credible in the
    sense that it is reasonably capable of belief; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>It must be such that if believed it
    could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, <span
class=GramE>be</span> expected to have affected the result.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru argues that the medical evidence could not
    have been adduced at trial even with due diligence because he was too ill to
    appreciate its importance.  I do not
    accept this argument.  Both Mr. Purcaru
    and the trial judge were alive to the issue of Mr. Purcaru’s psychiatric
    problems and their effect because those problems were raised in the course of argument
    of the motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru made several references to his depression.  He testified at trial that he continued to be
    “out of this world” for the balance of 2008.  However, he also testified that, after Czutrin J. granted him an
    adjournment in October 2008 to cope with his medical condition, he was able to
    focus on his case and prepare for trial.  He stated that by January 2009, he “felt better”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the argument that his depression caused
    his breaches would not have succeeded for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the allegation that Mr. Purcaru’s judgment was
    negatively affected by his 2008 depression and lesion diagnosis is belied by
    the fact that, in that same timeframe, Mr. Purcaru attended full-time at the
    University of Toronto and achieved a MBA.  This substantial accomplishment for a person whose thinking and judgment
    were allegedly severely compromised would be an important fact for an expert to
    consider when providing an opinion about the individual’s mental capacity.  However, although Dr. Gojer specifically
    addresses Mr. Purcaru’s alleged loss of clients and inability to function from
    April 2008 to May 2009, he makes no reference to Mr. Purcaru obtaining a MBA in
    that same period.  It may be that Mr.
    Purcaru did not inform Dr. Gojer of this accomplishment.  Without consideration of this information,
    and a more complete appreciation of Mr. Purcaru’s conduct throughout the
    entirety of the proceedings, the psychiatric opinion regarding the cause of Mr.
    Purcaru’s admitted breaches is not reliable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Mr. Purcaru’s history of misconduct, albeit
    including his disclosure obligations, significantly predated his June 2008
    attempted suicide.  For example, as I
    discussed earlier, his 2005 and 2006 financial statements deliberately and
    repeatedly concealed his purchases of the Gloucester Street properties.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  This suggests that his lack of “judgment”
    significantly predated his depression.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Mr. Purcaru breached the court orders in April
    or May 2008 when he applied for the $500,000 line of credit.  This was at least a month before he testified
    that he began to suffer from depression.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, Mr. Purcaru defaulted on his obligations even
    after he was medicated with anti-depressants and had accepted that the lesion
    in his brain did not require surgery.  Even assuming that Mr. Purcaru somehow could attribute his September
    2008 misconduct to his mental condition, he would have great difficulty
    advancing the same explanation for his depletion of his RRSPs given the
    admitted improvement in his mental health by January 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the motion to introduce
    fresh evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)       The remedy imposed</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I wholly accept Mr. Purcaru’s argument that pleadings
    should only be struck and trial participation denied in exceptional
    circumstances and where no other remedy would suffice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is particularly so in a family law case
    where the resulting judgment may provide for continuing obligations that can
    only be varied on proof of a change in circumstances.  A change in circumstances may be difficult to
    establish if the initial judgment is based on incorrect assumptions, thus
    perpetuating injustice.  Similarly,
    special care must be taken in family law cases where the interests of children
    are at issue.<span style='line-height:200%'> The
    consequences of striking pleadings or limiting trial evidence when custody or
    access is at issue was discussed in <i>King
    v. Mongrain</i> (2009), 66 R.F.L. (6<sup>th</sup>) 267 (Ont. C.A.)</span>,
    where Gillese J.A. observed at p. 273 that pleadings should not be struck if
    such a remedy leaves the court with insufficient information to determine
    custody<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'>See also <i>Haunert-Faga v. Faga</i> (2005), 203 O.A.C. 388
    (C.A.).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The adversarial system, through cross-examination and
    argument, functions to safeguard against injustice.  For this reason, the adversarial structure of
    a proceeding should be maintained whenever possible.  Accordingly, the objective of a sanction
    ought not to be the elimination of the adversary, but rather one that will
    persuade the adversary to comply with the orders of the court.  As this court said at p. 23 of <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Marcoccia v. Marcoccia</span></i><span style='line-height:200%'> (2009), 60 R.F.L. (6<sup>th</sup>) 1 (Ont. C.A.), the
    remedy of striking pleadings </span>is “a serious one and should only be used
    in unusual cases”.    The court also
    explained at p. 4 that the remedy imposed should not go “beyond that which is
    necessary to express the court’s disapproval of the conduct in issue.”  This is because denying a party the right to
    participate at trial may lead to factual errors giving rise to an injustice,
    which will erode confidence in the justice system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the decision to strike pleadings and to
    determine the parameters of trial participation is a discretionary one that is
    entitled to deference on appeal when exercised on proper principles.  The exercise of discretion will be upheld
    where the motion or trial judge fashions a remedy that is appropriate for the
    conduct at issue.  In <i>Sleiman v. Sleiman</i> (2002), 28 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    447 at p. 448, a case involving a refusal to provide financial disclosure, this
    court upheld the motion judge’s determination that the appellant had
    demonstrated a “blatant disregard for the process and the orders of the court”
    as well as her decision precluding the<span style='line-height:200%'> appellant from contesting his wife’s financial claims.  In <i>Vacca
    v. Banks</i> (2005), 6 C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>) 22 the plaintiff had repeatedly
    failed to comply with orders related to discovery and the progress of
    litigation.  Ferrier J. for the
    Divisional <span class=GramE>Court,</span> observed at p. 27 that the master’s remedy
    of the dismissal of the action may be an appropriate sanction to recognize the
    court’s “responsibility for the effective administration of justice”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge was alert to the proper
    principles.  He repeatedly and
    emphatically expressed the concept that trials should ideally proceed with the
    participation of the parties.  He was
    cognizant of and balanced the competing interests. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a case where the trial judge struck Mr.
    Purcaru’s pleadings and financial statements summarily, or without giving him
    an opportunity to correct or explain his conduct.  The trial judge appropriately called for and
    heard oral evidence, both from Mr. Purcaru’s chartered accountant and from Mr.
    Purcaru, who acknowledged the very transactions that amounted to breaches of
    the orders at issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent that the trial judge did not accept Mr.
    Purcaru’s proffered explanation that his assets had actually appreciated in
    value - an explanation not pursued on appeal - or that he believed he was
    acting within the confines of the orders.  He also did not accept that Mr. Purcaru would or could remedy his
    breaches.  Indeed, there were plenty of
    reasons not to accept Mr. Purcaru’s evidence on its face, including his
    attempts to rationalize his significant disbursements to his brother and his
    former girlfriend.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Mr. Purcaru’s credibility was brought into
    question by a review of his earlier sworn financial statements, which
    demonstrate a pattern of deception.  He
    also altered a medical report that he had annexed to his affidavit on an
    interlocutory motion earlier in the proceeding.  The motion judge, Herman J., specifically concluded that Mr. Purcaru had
    “crossed out” the words “identical to” in the medical report and replaced them
    with “different from”, apparently in an effort to make the report sound as
    though there were conflicting medical opinions about the seriousness of his
    lesion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of Mr. Purcaru’s conduct, the trial judge considered
    whether his participation would assist with arriving at the necessary factual findings.  He decided it would not.  He did so primarily because Mr. Purcaru
    continued to display an unwillingness to comply with orders of the court that
    were essential to ensure trial fairness, including his continued failure to
    comply with his disclosure obligations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge required Ms. Purcaru’s counsel to
    deliver a draft proposed judgment so that Mr. Purcaru would see and appreciate the
    details and significance of the relief sought by Ms. Purcaru.  Even after he was presented with the proposed
    judgment, Mr. Purcaru remained intransigent.  The most that he was prepared to do was “to make those disclosure in the
    trial.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While Mr. Purcaru suggested to the trial judge that
    costs would be an adequate remedy to address his misconduct, his depletion of
    assets suggested that any costs order could be ineffective.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, if Mr. Purcaru had been allowed to
    participate fully in the trial without completing his disclosure, counsel for
    Ms. Purcaru would have unfairly been denied the opportunity to prepare to meet his
    evidence about his financial situation.  The trial judge could have considered the alternative of allowing Mr.
    Purcaru to continue to participate, but drawing an adverse inference with
    regard to his assets and liabilities.  However, such a sanction would have been inadequate
    in light of the trial judge’s specific conclusion that Mr. Purcaru would
    prolong the trial with irrelevant issues without providing the disclosure
    necessary to arrive at a fair determination of his relevant worth and income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not explicitly consider providing
    Mr. Purcaru with other lesser forms of trial participation that may have assisted
    the court with its fact-finding role.  For example, the trial judge did not specifically address permitting Mr.
    Purcaru to cross-examine his wife or her expert to test the value of her assets
    and liabilities.  Nor did he address
    whether Mr. Purcaru could present argument at the conclusion of the
    evidence.  It would have been helpful if
    the trial judge had specifically discussed these alternatives because a litigant
    denied the right to call evidence may still potentially contribute to a trial.  That contribution could be made through
    partial or full cross-examination of one or more witnesses, or by making oral
    submissions on the evidence and the law.  However, a review of the record in this case demonstrates several
    reasons why the trial judge decided against allowing Mr. Purcaru the
    opportunity to cross-examine or present oral argument.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mr. Purcaru explained to the court that his
    trial participation was important, but only in relation to the quantification
    of his own income, assets and liabilities.  He did not ask for any form of participation regarding other issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Mr. Purcaru did not define any particular
    concerns about the income, assets and liabilities of Ms. Purcaru that would
    have supported a request to cross-examine her or her expert.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Mr. Purcaru’s demonstrated deception and unfocused
    approach would likely have prolonged the trial without advancing its
    truth-seeking purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it would have been unfair to allow Mr. Purcaru
    to present argument on matters such as entitlement to spousal support when he
    had failed to put forward his own position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, apart from his position on appeal that
    Ms. Purcaru did not call sufficient evidence at trial to support her claims
    regarding the tax liability or receipts for childcare, Mr. Purcaru does not
    present evidence to conclude that Ms. Purcaru obtained a windfall as a result
    of the lack of cross-examination or argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in my view, the trial judge properly
    exercised his discretion to decide that Mr. Purcaru’s participation at trial in
    any respect would not have been helpful or productive.  In light of Mr. Purcaru’s significant level
    of sophistication, manipulation and prevarication, this was one of those
    exceptional cases where the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the
    sanction imposed did not exceed what was necessary.  The trial judge’s disposition is entitled to
    deference.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         Refusal of
    an adjournment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Purcaru also argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to grant him an adjournment to obtain counsel for the motion to
    strike.  The trial judge gave Mr. Purcaru
    the opportunity to speak to counsel after counsel for Ms. Purcaru had informed
    the court that he intended to bring an application to strike Mr. Purcaru’s
    pleadings.  After the recess, rather than
    requesting an adjournment to retain counsel for the motion, Mr. Purcaru
    specifically said he was prepared to represent himself on both the motion and
    at trial.   He requested an adjournment
    to retain counsel only for the purposes of the contempt motion.  That request was granted.  I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         The
    challenges to the merits</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to Mr. Purcaru’s grounds of appeal challenging
    the substantive relief awarded by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mr. Purcaru challenges the award to compensate Ms.
    Purcaru for the $140,000 tax liability attributable to Mr. Purcaru.  However, in the absence of any evidence to
    the contrary, the trial judge was entitled to accept Ms. Purcaru’s evidence about
    this claim.  I see no error in the trial
    judge’s award, which I observe <span class=GramE>implicitly</span> requires Ms.
    Purcaru to pay that amount on Mr. Purcaru’s behalf or on behalf of the
    corporation.  There is no fresh evidence
    that justifies a conclusion that the award resulted in a windfall to Ms.
    Purcaru. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Mr. Purcaru cannot succeed in his challenge to
    the equalization award.  There was no
    persuasive evidence that Ms. Purcaru misrepresented her income, assets or
    liabilities.  In the absence of
    disclosure by Mr. Purcaru, the trial judge was entitled to accept Mr. DeBresser’s
    assumptions about Mr. Purcaru’s date of separation assets.  It was within Mr. DeBresser’s expertise to
    value those assets by working backward to query the sources of the monies Mr.
    Purcaru used to buy the Gloucester Street properties and to send money to
    Romania.  In addition, the record
    discloses that the trial judge properly credited Mr. Purcaru for his $50,000
    prepayment towards the equalization award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, I see no error in the trial judge’s award of
    section 7 expenses for the children.  Mr.
    Purcaru’s primary argument on this issue is that Ms. Purcaru did not provide paper
    receipts for the childcare expenses.  However, <span class=GramE>counsel at the hearing were</span> unable to
    explain exactly what evidence was before the trial judge from the court file.  Moreover, Mr. DeBresser testified that he was
    satisfied about these expenses.  In
    addition, it was evident that Ms. Purcaru incurred significant childcare
    expenses while she was working outside the home.  In her application, the contents of which she
    adopted at trial, Ms. Purcaru stated that costs for the children “before and
    after school ... <span class=GramE>total</span> $2,700 a month.”<b>  </b>In
    the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the trial judge was entitled to
    accept Ms. Purcaru’s evidence on this issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, Mr. Purcaru challenges the spousal support
    award on the basis that Ms. Purcaru failed to establish entitlement to support,
    which is an essential pre-condition to a support award.  Unfortunately, trial counsel for Ms. Purcaru
    did not specifically address the factors <span style='line-height:200%'>and objectives for spousal support set out in section 15.2 of
    the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. <span
class=reference1><span style='color:black'>1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.)</span></span>,
    nor did he question Ms. Purcaru orally </span>about any economic advantages or
    disadvantages that arose from her marriage or its breakdown or the financial
    consequences arising from her care of the children of the marriage or about any
    other relevant circumstances that would entitle her to support.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b> </b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the bulk of the evidence regarding entitlement
    was contained in Ms. Purcaru’s application, financial statement and affidavits
    that she specifically relied upon and adopted as true at trial.  In her affidavits, Ms. Purcaru explained that
    she was the primary parent who was responsible for the children’s care, including
    that of the daughter who had medical challenges at birth.  As well, Ms. Purcaru explained that her
    ability to work outside the home was affected by her responsibilities for the
    children and Mr. Purcaru’s lack of participation in their care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Purcaru’s application explicitly claimed
    entitlement to spousal support.  That
    claim was supported by her contributions to the advancement of Mr. Purcaru’s
    career, the limitations on her capacity to work and to advance her own career
    as a result of her care of the children, particularly the parties’ daughter, as
    well as her assumption of responsibility for the household.  Ms. Purcaru also attested to the effect on
    her career of Mr. Purcaru’s pre-separation conduct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, a finding of entitlement to the retrospective
    support awarded is implicit in the reasons of the experienced family law trial
    judge, who had before him evidence relevant to entitlement and who would have
    been well aware that entitlement is a pre-condition to a spousal support
    order.  It would have been preferable if
    the trial judge had articulated the factors and objectives that supported a
    finding of entitlement.  However, in my
    view, those factors and objectives are apparent on the face of the record in
    this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that the spousal support awarded by the trial
    judge, <span class=GramE>which</span> included prejudgment interest, amounted
    to no more than four years of time-limited spousal support for the time frame
    when the children were quite young and required their mother’s close attention.  I am not persuaded that there is any basis to
    interfere with the amount of that award. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>V.        RESULT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to
    Ms. Purcaru fixed in the amount of $12,500, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

    aspect of the trial evidence highlights the potential for injustice when trial
    participation is disallowed and why such a result should be exceptional.  Mr. Purcaru’s evidence on the motion to admit
    fresh evidence indicated the $325,000 payment was funded from the line of
    credit, not his income.  This evidence
    was not available at the trial proper.  Nonetheless, there was ample evidence that the $350,000 estimate of his
    income was conservative.  </p>

    July 2009 affidavit on the stay motion in this court, Mr. Purcaru claimed that
    he was then “prepared to sell my house and one of my apartments and pay the
    monies into court in an attempt to partially purge my contempt.”   Unfortunately, Mr. Purcaru did not make that
    suggestion at the time of the motion. </p>
