  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Abraham Aronowicz and Dr. Harry Aronowicz are
    brothers.  From 1982 until 2006, each of
    them owned or controlled 50 per cent of the common shares of Emtwo Properties
    Inc., a company that owned and operated five commercial properties in Toronto
    and Vancouver.  Each was a director, but
    Abraham was responsible for the day-to-day management and operations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 1, 1988, Abraham and Harry and their father
    executed a Unanimous Shareholders’ Agreement containing a buy/sell Shotgun
    Provision.  On November 18, 2004, Harry
    triggered the provision, offering to pay approximately $26 million for
    Abraham’s interest in the company.  The
    brothers have been in litigation of one form or another ever since.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was arbitration over the mechanism by which
    Abraham chose to respond to Harry’s offer.  Eventually, however, the buy/sell transaction closed and Harry acquired
    Abraham’s interest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abraham subsequently learned that, as part of the
    financing arrangements by which Harry raised the funds to buy him out, Harry
    had agreed to repay the loan by transferring three of Emtwo’s properties to the
    lender.  Abraham – who had acquired and
    managed the properties for Emtwo over two decades – was indignant about this
    and sued both Harry and the lender, Menashe Grinshpan (and their respective
    corporations).  He alleges that Harry had
    an obligation to disclose these financing details because, had he known of
    them, he could have responded differently in the shotgun process.  He does not say how he might have done so,
    other than to suggest that he might have challenged Harry’s right to trigger
    the Shotgun Provision.  Nor does it seem
    to bother him that he, himself, agreed with his proposed lender to mortgage the
    Emtwo properties as part of his own financing arrangements when considering
    whether he would be a buyer or a seller.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abraham alleges a pantheon of claims and causes of
    action in the proceedings, including breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty
    of good faith, theft of a corporate opportunity, disclosure of confidential
    information, oppression, deceit or misrepresentation, conspiracy, inducing
    breach of contract, unjust enrichment and waiver of tort.  In spite of the litany of alleged wrongdoing,
    Justice Wilton-Siegel granted summary judgment in favour of the defendants,
    dismissing the action in its entirety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the appellants, Mr. Leon argues that the
    motion judge made essentially three errors: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:200%'>1)        He applied the
    wrong approach to a summary judgment motion by (a) failing to apply the
    “genuine issue for trial” test and instead applying a “no chance of success”
    test, (b) reversing the onus of proof, (c) reaching conclusions based on
    assumed facts, (d) improperly weighing evidence and drawing inferences; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>2)        He decided novel issues of law; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:200%'>3)        He misconstrued
    the Loan Agreement between Harry and Menashe Grinshpan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these submissions, and would dismiss
    the appeal for the following reasons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Shotgun Provision in the Unanimous Shareholders’
    Agreement provided that either of the brothers could purchase the shares held
    by the other.  Under its terms, the
    recipient of an offer had the sole and complete discretion to exercise one of
    three options: (1) he could accept the offer; (2) he could deliver what was
    called a “Split Decision Notice” (allowing the offeree to divide all of the
    Emtwo assets into two packages for division between the two shareholders); or
    (3) he could elect to purchase all of the shares of the offeror at a 10 per
    cent discount from the offeror’s common share price.  The only other means of terminating the
    relationship between the parties was by way of a consensual winding-up of
    Emtwo.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the years, Harry concluded that he wished to
    dissolve the business relationship between the two brothers.  Abraham opposed the winding-up of the company,
    leaving Harry with the Shotgun Provision as the only mechanism to accomplish
    his wishes.  He began looking for
    financing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Menashe Grinshpan was Harry’s neighbour and someone he
    had met socially at street functions but with whom he had never before done
    business.  Mr. Grinshpan was in the
    process of closing a large business deal and, as it turned out, was willing to make
    available the funds that Harry needed to trigger the shotgun.  Mr. Grinshpan and some of Mr. Grinshpan’s
    companies (collectively, the “Lenders”) entered into a Loan Agreement with
    Harry on November 14, 2004.  The Loan
    Agreement was designed to respond to any of the three options open to
    Abraham.  If Abraham elected to purchase
    Harry’s shares, or to deliver a Split Decision Notice, the Lenders would
    receive an approximate $1.7 million fee.  If Abraham accepted or was deemed to have accepted Harry’s offer to
    purchase, the Lenders would lend Harry up to $26 million.  In the latter event – and this is at the nub
    of the dispute – a substantial portion of the loan was to be repaid by Harry
    causing Emtwo to transfer three of Emtwo’s properties to the Lenders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Loan Agreement was not disclosed to Abraham.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After receiving Harry’s offer on November 21, 2004,
    Abraham considered his options.  As part
    of that process, he sought financing to purchase Harry’s shares.  It appears that his own potential financing
    package involved the pledging of Emtwo’s assets.  Moreover, Abraham’s negotiating process
    involved similar exchanges of confidential information regarding Emtwo’s
    affairs to those that he criticizes Harry in the action for making.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, Abraham concluded that he would not be a
    buyer because he was unwilling to assume the level of debt that such an option
    would entail.  Instead, on February 16,
    2005, he delivered a Split Decision Notice and subsequently, on August 10, 2005,
    he elaborated on that by delivering a Division Notice proposing that each of
    Emtwo’s five properties would be held in equal undivided interests as
    tenants-in-common.  Harry rejected this
    approach because, in his view, it was not in compliance with the Shotgun Provision
    and it did not have the effect of severing the relationship between the
    parties.  This issue was arbitrated
    before the Hon. Coulter Osborne, who ruled in Harry’s favour.  As a result, Abraham was deemed to have
    accepted Harry’s offer to purchase.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sale transaction was completed on May 26,
    2006.  In the <span class=GramE>Fall</span> of that year, Abraham became aware of the terms of the Loan Agreement when it
    was accidentally disclosed to him.  This
    lawsuit followed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge Did Not Err in His Approach to Summary
    Judgment</h3>
  <p><b>(a)</b>       <b>The Test and the Burden of Proof</b><u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper test for summary judgment – as articulated
    by Morden A.C.J.O. in <i>Irving Ungerman
    Ltd. v. Galanis</i> (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 545, at pp. 550-551 – is whether there
    is a genuine issue of material fact that requires a trial for its resolution.  Neither <i>Aguonie
    v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc</i>. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), nor <i>Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc</i>.
    (1998), 164 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont. C.A.) – the two summary judgment authorities
    most referred to in this Province – alter this test.  Indeed, they affirm it.  What <i>Augonie</i> and <i>Dawson</i> and their jurisprudential
    progeny have done is develop a more restricted view of the analytical approach
    to be adopted by the summary judgment motion judge and of the judge’s role in
    determining the “genuine issue for trial” question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the motion judge applied the correct test.  He addressed each of the appellant’s proposed
    causes of action and claims in his careful and thorough 40-page reasons.  With respect to each of them, he considered
    whether there were any material facts in dispute and whether there was a
    genuine issue of a factual nature concerning the causes of action or claims
    that required a trial for determination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was alive to, and applied, the
    appropriate test and the approach to such motions mandated by <i>Augonie</i> and <i>Dawson</i>, and more recently by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 372<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and <i>Guarantee Co. of North America
    v. Gordon Capital Corp</i>., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423.  In this respect, the motion judge explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principles applicable to a summary judgment
    motion are most succinctly set out in <span class=italic1><span
style='color:black'>Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage and
    Warehouse Inc.</span></span> <span style='"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>(1998),
    164 D.L.R. (4th) 257</span> (Ont. C.A.), in which Borins J.A. states at
    para. <span class=GramE>13 that the essential purpose of summary judgment is to
    isolate, and then terminate, claims and defences that are factually
    unsupported.</span> A defendant who seeks to dismiss an action on a summary
    judgment motion bears the burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of a
    material fact requiring a trial. On a summary judgment motion, the Court is not
    to assess credibility, weigh evidence or draw factual inferences. On the other
    hand, the Court is entitled to assume that the record contains all of the
    evidence which the parties will present if there is a trial. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the present motion, the issue for the Court is,
    for the most part, whether the undisputed facts before the Court support any of
    the causes of action alleged by the plaintiffs. The issue is not whether a
    genuine issue for trial exists with respect to facts that are material for one
    or more causes of action. Rather, the issue is whether, on the record before
    the Court, any or all of the plaintiffs’ causes of action are so doubtful that
    the case does not deserve consideration by a trier of fact at a future trial: see <span class=italic1>Pizza Pizza Ltd. v.
    Gillespie</span> <span style='"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>(1990),
    75 O.R. (2d) 225</span> (Gen. Div.)
    at 238 and <span class=italic1>Papaschase Indian Band No. 136 v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</span>, <span style='"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>[2008]
    1 S.C.R. 372</span> at para. <span class=GramE>10, both of which appear to
    have involved the same exercise.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On this motion, therefore, the Court is required to
    give a good hard look at the evidence and to grant summary judgment if it
    concludes that “the facts do not entitle the plaintiff to some remedy from the
    defendant”: see <span class=italic1><span
style='color:black'>Dawson v. Rexcraft</span></span> at para. 13. In <span
class=italic1><span style='color:black'>Papaschase</span></span> at para. 10, the Supreme Court
    appears to have set the test for summary judgment to be demonstration that the
    claims “have no chance of success”. I have adopted this standard on this
    motion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While similar to a Rule 21 motion, I have therefore
    approached the issue on this motion as a determination not as to whether the
    pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action but as to whether the
    plaintiffs’ various causes of action have no chance of success based on the
    undisputed facts before the Court. I should note, as well, that I do not agree
    with the plaintiffs that the Court is entitled to make only one determination
    of law pursuant to Rule 20.04(4) on a summary judgment motion. Rule 20.04(4) is
    sufficiently flexible to be applied separately in respect of each cause of
    action. A party cannot prevent summary judgment by alleging a multiplicity of
    unmeritorious causes of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a correct recitation of the applicable law and I
    am satisfied, on a review of the motion judge’s reasons as a <span class=GramE>whole,
    that</span> he applied these principles throughout.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Lameman</i> (referred to by the motion judge

style='line-height:200%;color:black'>Papaschase</span></span><span
class=italic1><span style='line-height:200%;

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This
    appeal is from an application for summary judgment. The summary judgment rule
    serves an important purpose in the civil litigation system. It prevents claims
    or defences that have no chance of success from proceeding to trial. Trying unmeritorious
    claims imposes a heavy price in terms of time and cost on the parties to the
    litigation and on the justice system. It is essential to the proper operation
    of the justice system and beneficial to the parties that claims that have no
    chance of success be weeded out at an early stage. Conversely, it is essential
    to justice that claims disclosing real issues that may be successful <span
class=GramE>proceed</span> to trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For this
    reason, the bar on a motion for summary judgment is high. <i>The defendant who seeks summary dismissal bears the evidentiary burden
    of showing that there is “no genuine issue of material fact requiring trial</i>”: <i>Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.</i>, <span style='
color:windowtext;'>[1999] 3 S.C.R. 423</span>,
    at para. 27. The defendant must prove this; it cannot rely on mere allegations
    or the pleadings: <i>1061590 Ontario Ltd. v. Ontario Jockey Club</i> <span style='
color:windowtext;'>(1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 547</span> (C.A.); <i>Tucson Properties Ltd. v. Sentry Resources Ltd.</i> <span style='
color:windowtext;'>(1982), 22 Alta. L.R. (2d) 44</span> (Q.B. (Master)), at pp. 46-47. If the defendant does prove this, the
    plaintiff must either refute or counter the defendant's evidence, or risk
    summary dismissal: <i>Murphy Oil Co. v. Predator Corp.</i> <span style='
color:windowtext;'>(2004), 365 A.R. 326</span>, <span style='
color:windowtext;'>2004 ABQB 688</span>, at p.
    331, aff'd <span style='
color:windowtext;'>(2006), 55 Alta. L.R. (4th) 1</span>, <span style='
color:windowtext;'>2006 ABCA 69</span>. Each
    side must “put its best foot forward” with respect to the existence or
    non-existence of material issues to be tried: <i>Transamerica Life Insurance
    Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i> <span style='
color:windowtext;'>(1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 423</span> (Gen. Div.), at p. 434; <span class=SpellE><i>Goudie</i></span><i> v.
    Ottawa (City)</i>, <span style='
color:windowtext;'>[2003] 1 S.C.R. 141</span>, <span style='
color:windowtext;'>2003 SCC 14</span>, at
    para. 32. The chambers judge may make inferences of fact based on the
    undisputed facts before the court, as long as the inferences are strongly
    supported by the facts: <i>Guarantee Co. of North America</i>, at para. 30.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the motion judge improperly
    applied a “no chance of success” test.  However, it is clear from the foregoing that the “no chance of success”
    principle is simply another way of expressing the view that where there are no
    genuine issues of fact that require a trial for determination and the claim
    cannot be proved on the basis of the undisputed facts, the action should not be
    permitted to go to trial.  This is
    consistent with Justice Borins’ recognition in <i>Dawson</i>, at para. <span class=GramE>14, that “the function of a
    motion for summary judgment” is “[to weed] out cases where a substantively
    adequate claim, or defence, has been pleaded, but cannot be proved”</span>.  In other words, summary judgment is used to
    weed out cases where there is no chance of success. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More recently, this Court refused to interfere with a
    summary judgment order granted on the ground that there was “no chance of
    success” with respect to the claim against one defendant, in effect equating
    that standard with “no genuine issue for trial”: <span class=SpellE><i>Starcevic</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Brinac</span></i>, 2009 ONCA 224.</p>
  <h3>(b)<span style='font-weight:normal'>       </span>The Motion Judge Did Not Reverse
    the Onus of Proof<u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same vein, the motion judge did not reverse the onus
    of proof.  He clearly understood – as
    indicated in para. 28 of his reasons, cited at para. 17 above – that “[a]
    defendant who seeks to dismiss an action on a summary judgment motion bears the
    burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring a
    trial”.  The appellants seize upon a
    subsequent statement in para. 117 of the reasons in support of their argument
    that the motion judge reversed the onus.  There, the motion judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, to succeed in this action, <i>the plaintiffs must establish</i> that the
    particular circumstances of the relationship between the shareholders prior to
    the exercise of the Shotgun Provision imposed upon Harry duties in respect of
    his financing arrangements that would not ordinarily operate in the circumstances
    of termination of a joint shareholder relationship. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then went on to recite five reasons
    why, in his view, the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate evidence of such
    circumstances.  I read this simply as a
    reflection of the appellant’s obligation to “put its best foot forward” on the
    motion, however.  It is apparent from a
    review of the reasons as a whole that in each instance where the motion judge
    considered whether a cause of action or a claim asserted by the appellants
    could survive summary judgment scrutiny, he did so expressly against the
    backdrop of the moving party’s obligation to demonstrate that no genuine issue
    for trial arose with respect to that cause of action of claim.</p>
  <h3>(c)       The Motion Judge Did Not Improperly Reach His Conclusions
    Based on Assumed Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ third complaint is that the motion
    judge improperly decided the motion based on assumed facts.  In this regard, they rely upon decisions of
    this Court in <i>Royal Bank of Canada v.
    Société <span class=SpellE>Générale</span> (Canada)</i> (2006), 31 B.L.R. (4th)
    63, leave to appeal to S.C.C. denied, [2007] S.C.C.A No. 87; <i>Law Society of Upper Canada v. Ernst &amp;
    Young</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 577; and <span class=SpellE><i>Chitel</i></span><i> v. Bank of
    Montreal</i>, (1999) 126 O.A.C. 159.   I
    shall review these authorities briefly in assessing the validity of this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i><span
lang=FR-CA>Société Générale</span></i><span
lang=FR-CA> </span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Société <span
class=SpellE>Générale</span> </i>involved a complicated series of actions arising
    out of a sophisticated commercial fraud supported by cheques allegedly negotiated
    by fraudsters on forged endorsements.  The reverberations of the fraud worked their
    way up through the chain of financial institutions involved in the transactions
    and the buck stopped with RBC, as it were.  RBC was required to honour the cheques through the “reverse clearing” mechanism
    established by member banks of the Canadian Payment Association.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, cheques must be “forged” or “unauthorized” as
    a pre-condition to reverse clearing.  RBC
    commenced an action against the financial institutions below it in the chain,
    contesting the forged/unauthorized character of the cheques, and claiming
    damages for negligence, unjust enrichment, money had and received, and
    conversion.  It also alleged that the
    defendants were “precluded” from relying upon the reverse clearing mechanism because
    the cheque endorsements had not been forged or unauthorized.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The financial institutions sued included Société <span
class=SpellE>Générale</span> (Canada), <span class=SpellE>CitiCapital</span> Limited, and Bank of Montreal.  They all moved
    for summary judgment dismissing the claims against them.  Summary judgment was partially granted,
    dismissing the claims for damages for negligence, unjust enrichment and money
    had and received.  Importantly, however,
    the action was permitted to continue with respect to RBC’s claims for
    conversion and preclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the issues on appeal in <span class=SpellE><i>Socété</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Générale</span></i> was whether the motion judge
    was entitled to proceed – as he did, apparently with the parties’ agreement –
    on the assumption that the cheque endorsements had been forged.  This Court, at para. <span class=GramE>9,</span> concluded he was not: it was inappropriate in the circumstances for the motion
    judge to have “decided the motions on the basis of a critical fact that he
    assumed to be true for the purpose of the motion”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Speaking for the Court, Borins J.A. observed that by
    proceeding on the assumption the endorsements were forged, the motion judge had
    deprived RBC, and its insurers (in other related claims) from advancing their
    core position at trial – i.e., that the cheques were not forged – on the basis
    of a full evidentiary record.  He said,
    at para. 42, that “deciding a Rule 20 motion on assumed facts is contrary to
    this court’s direction that on a Rule 20 motion all of the evidence that could
    be led at trial should be before the court” and that “it is unfair to dismiss a
    litigant’s claim and to deprive the litigant of its right to a trial on the
    basis of an artificially curtailed record”.  He also noted that in artificially restricting the record on the summary
    judgment motions the motion judge “created a real risk of conflicting decisions
    on the same factual and legal issues within the same action”.</p>
  <h3><i>Ernst &amp;
    Young</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ernst &amp;
    Young</i>, the Law Society of Upper Canada sued its former auditors and
    actuaries for breach of contract, negligence and negligent misrepresentation.  There were material issues of fact in dispute
    and genuine issues for trial to be determined in relation to those claims.  However, there was an overriding question of
    law that went to the heart of the Law Society’s right to recover: the
    defendants alleged that even if they were at fault, damages were not
    recoverable because the Law Society had passed on the damages to its members
    through supplemental and increased levies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants moved for summary judgment under rule
    20.04 and for the determination of a question of law under rule 21.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a).  For the
    purposes of these motions only, the defendants conceded that the plaintiff
    could prove the alleged breach of contract, negligence and negligent
    misrepresentation.  The motion judge
    proceeded on that basis.  He dismissed
    the motions, save for the granting of declaratory relief under Rule 21 with
    respect to one aspect of the plaintiff’s damage claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a split decision, this Court allowed the appeal and
    remitted the matter for trial on all issues.  Borins J.A. concluded that the motion judge erred in adjudicating the
    motions on the basis of facts assumed or conceded for the purposes of the
    motion, thus rendering the question of law determined “hypothetical”.  He expressed a similar concern to that raised
    in <i>Société <span class=SpellE>Générale</span></i>,
    namely that because the matter was proceeding to trial in any event, there was
    a risk of inconsistent factual findings.  At para. 46, he noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As the above cases illustrate, because the motion
    judge’s legal analysis was informed by the defendants’ concession of their
    alleged wrongful conduct, it is not possible to say that any of the legal
    results that flow from the motion judge’s order will survive a revision of the
    facts at the trial that is to be held consequent to the motion judges’ order.  As the defendants’ motion was dismissed,
    there must be a trial at which the facts as found by the trial judge may differ
    from the facts assumed for the purpose of the motions.  This possible revision of the facts on the
    basis of a complete trial record graphically demonstrates the hypothetical
    nature of the questions of law that the motion judge was asked to decide.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McMurtry C.J.O. delivered reasons concurring in the
    result but disagreeing with Borins J.A.’s conclusion that the appellants’
    hypothetical admission of negligence was fatal to their motion under Rule 21.  In that respect, the Chief Justice agreed
    with <span class=SpellE>Carthy</span>&nbsp;J.A.’s dissent.  Both concluded that the hypothetical
    concession was not essential for the determination of the question of law under
    rule 21.01(a).  As Carthy J.A. noted, at
    para. 65:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The essence of the motion lies within rule 21.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a), seeking a determination of a question of law.  Here, two questions of law [arise].  Were damages sustained and, if so, does the
    defence of “passing on” prevent their recovery.  It is only after those questions of law are resolved that any issue of
    summary judgment under Rule 20 or striking of pleadings under rule 21.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) could arise.  Thus, I would not look to jurisprudence concerning the latter rules to
    determine the outcome of this appeal.</p>
  <h3>            <span class=SpellE><i>Chitel</i></span><i></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE><i>Chitel</i></span><i> </i>was a complex action with many parties,
    arising out of a failed joint venture concerning a parcel of land.  The motion judge granted summary judgment in
    favour of two of the parties and an order narrowing the issues regarding <span
class=SpellE>Chitel’s</span> claims against the bank and two other
    defendants.  However, he dismissed <span
class=SpellE>Chitel’s</span> motion for summary judgment against various
    defendants and the bank’s motion for summary judgment against <span
class=SpellE>Chitel</span>.  These
    matters were to go to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court set aside the summary <span class=GramE>judgment,</span> at least partly on the basis that the motion judge erred in proceeding on the
    basis of counsel’s agreement to abandon certain contested factual positions for
    the purposes of the motion.  The motion
    judge’s legal analysis was based on the conceded facts and it was therefore
    impossible to say whether any of the legal results would survive a revision of
    the facts at the trial was still to come.</p>
  <h3><i>Société <span class=SpellE>Générale</span>, Ernst &amp; Young and <span class=SpellE>Chitel</span> are Distinguishable</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Justice Wilton-Siegel, however, that these
    authorities are distinguishable from the present case.  I do not read them as precluding a judge in
    all cases from assuming the existence of certain facts for purposes of
    disposing of a motion for summary judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What the <i>Société <span
class=SpellE>Générale</span></i> line of cases illustrates is that a motion
    judge may not assume the existence of critical disputed facts for purposes of a
    summary judgment motion where there continue to be issues to be tried in which
    those same facts may be in dispute, and where doing so would (a) undermine the
    ability of a party to present its case in relation to other issues still to be
    determined in the proceedings or, (b) create the risk of inconsistent findings
    or conflicting decisions in those proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is clear, I think, from Borins J.A.’s statement in <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i>, at para 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, <i>had
    the defendants been prepared to admit for all purposes</i> that they had
    breached their contracts with the plaintiffs or had performed their services
    negligently, that would have removed the hypothetical nature of the questions
    of law raised by their motions. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To similar effect is this Court’s statement in <span
class=SpellE><i>Chitel</i></span>, at para.
    7:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In any case where it is left open to the motions judge
    on the summary judgment motion to narrow the issues for trial or to grant
    partial summary judgment to any party, then any agreement on the facts<i> must be for the purposes of the entire
    proceeding</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the motion judge accepted the appellants’ case at
    its highest, i.e., that they would be able to establish the duty of honesty and
    good faith they alleged if there were a trial, and the scope of that duty as
    they asserted it.  No other matters
    involving that issue remained to be tried following his decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contended that in the conduct of the
    business and operations of Emtwo, the parties were subject to a duty of
    “honesty and good faith” in favour of each other.  And they were very clear about the content of
    that obligation: it invoked (a) a duty to disclose any information or document
    that could have an impact on Emtwo or its properties, and (b) a duty not to
    take any action that would harm the interest of the other as a shareholder of
    Emtwo.  The existence of such a duty was
    of no avail to the appellants, however, if, on the undisputed facts, the
    parties’ conduct under the Shotgun Provision did not attract such a duty.  The motion judge concluded it did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming the existence of the duty of honesty and good
    faith contended for by the appellants gave rise to none of the concerns
    expressed in the <i>Société <span
class=SpellE>Générale</span></i> line of authorities.  The summary judgment motions determined the
    whole proceeding, subject to appeal.  There was therefore no risk of conflicting findings or a revision of the
    facts affecting the legal result at a later trial.  Moreover, the ability of the appellants to
    present their case was not prejudiced because the motion judge accepted the
    disputed factual underpinning for their duty of good faith claim at its highest
    in their favour.  In particular, the
    motion judge did not – as argued in para. 37 of the appellants’ factum –
    “[deprive] the Appellants of the opportunity to put forward their evidence to a
    trial judge and to have the judge make the necessary findings of credibility
    and draw inferences from the evidence by dismissing the claims based on the
    assumed limited scope of the duties”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he concluded – correctly in my view – that even
    if the appellants were to succeed <i>fully</i> on the disputed facts giving rise to the duty at a trial, there nonetheless
    remained no genuine issue that required a trial for its resolution regarding
    the good faith ground.  This was so
    because, accepting the existence and scope of the duty as put forward by the
    appellants, on the undisputed facts the duty would not give rise to a remedy in
    the circumstances.  Secondly, the motion
    judge did not assume a limited scope of the duty, leaving the prospect that a
    broader scope might be established at trial.  His assumption was based on the precise scope of the duty asserted by
    the appellants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no dispute that Harry did not disclose the
    Loan Agreement.  However, the motion
    judge concluded that the duty of honesty and good faith alleged, even if
    established, would not require the disclosure of the Loan Agreement in the
    context of the operation of the Shotgun Provision.  I agree.  There was therefore no genuine issue for trial
    on the question of whether Harry was obliged to disclose the terms of the Loan
    Agreement (the issue with respect to which the motion judge’s assumption was
    made).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it cannot be said in the circumstances of this
    case that deciding the summary judgment motion on the basis of assumed facts
    was contrary to this Court’s direction that on a Rule 20 motion, all of the
    evidence that could be led at trial should be before the court as was the case,
    for example, in <i>Société <span
class=SpellE>Générale</span></i>.  Here,
    examinations for discovery and production had been completed.  In addition, the parties had the benefit of
    cross-examination on the affidavits filed in connection with the summary
    judgment motion.  The motion judge had a
    full and complete record before him.</p>
  <h3>(d)       The Motion Judge Did Not Err in Weighing Evidence and Drawing
    Inferences </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not satisfied that the motion judge erred by
    engaging in an exercise of weighing the evidence and drawing inferences of the
    type prohibited on motions for summary judgment.  Leaving aside the facts underpinning the
    appellants’ allegation of a duty of honesty and good faith – which were assumed
    at their highest, in favour of the appellants – the material facts in the
    action were not in dispute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely heavily on the well-accepted
    principle that causes of action involving allegations of fiduciary duties, good
    faith, oppression and misrepresentation are individually fact-laden.  In determining whether, on the specific
    facts, the duty has been breached, they contend, “there is no substitute … for
    a meticulous examination of the facts”: <span class=SpellE><i><span lang=EN-US>Hodgkinson</span></i></span><i><span lang=EN-US> v. Simms</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, at pp 413-414.</span><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US> </span></span><span lang=EN-US> </span>Here, however, the motion judge had a
    full and complete record before him and the material facts were not in dispute.  On that basis he could conduct the requisite
    “<span lang=EN-US>meticulous examination”, and he
    did so.</span>  The brothers were
    brothers.  Emtwo was a family company
    founded by the brothers and their father together.  Abraham had managed its operations for 20
    years.  Harry had not.  There were differences.  Harry wanted out.  Abraham would not agree to a winding-up.  Harry arranged financing and pulled the Shotgun
    Provision trigger.  He did not reveal the
    contents of his Loan Agreement, but the particulars of that Loan Agreement were
    before the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Leon submits that the extent of fiduciary duties
    owed by Harry to Abraham and to Emtwo, the extent of Harry’s duty of good faith
    owed to Abraham, and matters relating to the oppression remedy must all be
    considered in the context of the activities and evolving relationship of the
    brothers and the company over a period of more than 20 years.  I agree.  But I do not agree that it was impermissible for the motion judge to
    make that determination on the record before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To support this conclusion, I need not go through the
    motion judge’s lengthy reasoning and analysis with respect to each of the
    causes of action asserted, and the myriad ways of asserting those causes of
    action contained within them (Mr. Lax says there are 23 causes of action
    asserted, and 30 separate claims within them).  I am satisfied on the whole, that he was
    entitled to reject each of the appellant’s claims on the basis that there were
    no genuine issues that required a trial for their resolution, having regard to
    the material undisputed facts before him.  However, I will touch on some of the causes of action and claims briefly.</p>
  <h3><i>Fiduciary
    Duty</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is hard to conceive of a corporate/commercial
    mechanism less likely to attract the operation of fiduciary obligations than a
    shotgun buy/sell provision in a unanimous shareholder agreement.  The same may be said for the operation of obligations
    to act reasonably, honestly and in good faith – other than the good faith
    obligation not to act in a fashion that eviscerates the very purpose of the
    agreement.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  A shotgun buy/sell provision is the
    quintessential corporate mechanism for the exercise of shareholder
    self-interest.   Carefully drafted, it provides a delicate
    balance for the preservation of the parties’ individual rights by ensuring that
    the pulling of the trigger generates the best and highest price in exchange for
    the involuntary termination of the shareholders’ relationship.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Shotgun Provision here appears to have been
    well-drafted.  It ensures that the
    shareholder who first activates it does so at a price sufficiently high that he
    will be prepared to be bought out, himself, at a 10 per cent discount.  The recipient of the offer, on the other
    hand, has the option of being a buyer at the discounted price, or of selling at
    the higher price, or of suggesting a division of the corporate assets, tempered
    in this case by the old parents’ stratagem: here, Abraham cuts the pie and Harry
    gets to choose first (as per Article 12.13 of the Unanimous Shareholders’
    Agreement).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge accurately captured this reality in
    disposing of the fiduciary duty claim as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no basis for the operation of a fiduciary
    duty in respect of the exercise of the Shotgun Provision.  The Shotgun Provision specifically enables a
    shareholder to act in his own interest and contrary to the interest of another
    party who wishes to maintain the existing ownership structure of the
    corporation.  Moreover, Harry was not in
    a position to unilaterally exercise any power or discretion so as to affect
    Abraham’s legal or economic interests apart from triggering the Shotgun
    Provision.  Nor is there any basis for
    finding that Abraham was at the mercy of Harry in some manner or was otherwise
    vulnerable to him.  The circumstances
    upon which Sanderson J. imposed a fiduciary duty in <i>Waxman v. Waxman</i> (2002), 25 B.L.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. S.C.J) are entirely
    absent in the present proceeding.  There
    is no room in such circumstances for the operation of a fiduciary duty in the
    sense of a duty of the exercising shareholder to prefer the interests of the
    other shareholder(s) to his own or a duty to act only in accordance with
    interests of the other shareholder in the exercise of the Shotgun Provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the relationship between Harry and
    Abraham in the context of the Shotgun Provision that carries any indicia of
    such a relationship.  No duty of loyalty
    or good faith.  No discretionary power or
    trust.  No undertaking by one party to
    submerge its own interests and to act for the benefit of the other.  No dependency or vulnerability.  As noted above, the relationship between
    parties to a shotgun buy/sell agreement is the very antithesis of these
    attributes.  See <span class=SpellE><i>Hodgkinson</i></span><i> v. Simms; Frame v. Smith</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, at para. 136, Wilson
    J., dissenting; <i>Lac Minerals Ltd. v.
    International Corona Resources Ltd.</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574, at p. 599, Sopinka
    J., dissenting in part, and pp. 646-647, La Forest J.; <i>K.L.B. v. British Columbia</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 403, at paras. 40-41.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, courts are appropriately reluctant to impose
    fiduciary duties where the parties’ relationship is governed by commercial
    contract.  As La Forest J. noted in <span
class=SpellE><i>Hodgkinson</i></span>, at p.
    414:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Commercial interactions between parties at arm’s
    length normally derive their social utility from the pursuit of self-interest,
    and the courts are rightly circumspect when asked to enforce a duty (i.e., the
    fiduciary duty) that vindicates the very antithesis of self-interest.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was entitled to conclude on the
    undisputed facts that no fiduciary duty existed as between Harry and Abraham
    with respect to the triggering of the Shotgun Provision.</p>
  <h3><i>Corporate
    Opportunity</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the motion judge was satisfied that the
    Loan Agreement, with its potential transfer of Emtwo properties to Menashe
    Grinshpan, did not constitute the appropriation of a corporate opportunity by
    Harry.  He wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The foregoing suggests that there is a qualitative
    difference between the type of transaction that Abraham had in mind in raising
    his concern about a possible corporate opportunity and the transaction that
    Harry concluded with Menashe.  The
    evidence is clear that the arrangements under the Loan Agreement respecting the
    Transferred Properties did not constitute a corporate opportunity of the nature
    that was of concern to Abraham because, as a factual matter, they did not
    involve the sale of the Transferred Properties for a profit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the motion judge erred in
    concluding that Abraham’s claim for appropriation of a corporate opportunity
    proceeded from his entitlement to know of any “back pocket offers” that would
    entitled Harry “to flip” the properties for a “profit” (as opposed to a
    “benefit”).  They also say he erred by
    making findings about what “Abraham had in mind in raising his concern,”
    including the finding that the arrangements were not “of a nature that was of
    concern to Abraham.”  This constituted
    impermissible fact-finding on a motion for summary judgment, the appellants
    contend.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What Abraham had in mind in raising his concern about a
    possible corporate opportunity was not a mystery, however, or the subject of
    disputed fact.  He was concerned that the
    Loan Agreement signalled an opportunity for Emtwo to sell some of its
    properties to Mr. Grinshpan, and that Harry was using the Shotgun Provision to
    “flip” the properties for his own benefit at Emtwo’s expense (and therefore, Abraham’s).  The evidence showed that Emtwo’s properties
    were known to be in play.  There was no
    evidence, however, that Abraham or Emtwo had any interest in selling the
    properties at the values negotiated by Harry for the purposes of the Loan
    Agreement and, indeed – as the motion judge noted – the values ascribed to the
    properties in the Loan Agreement were <i>less </i>than other expressions of interest in the properties received from third
    parties.  Thus, there was no hidden
    profit or benefit to Harry in the transfers contemplated under the Loan
    Agreement other than the benefit of being able to finance the shotgun
    transaction, something he was entitled to do.  Nor was there a corporate “opportunity.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, there was no theft of a corporate opportunity
    both because there was no fiduciary relationship between Harry and Abraham in
    relation to the Shotgun Provision and because there was no corporate
    opportunity to steal.  </p>
  <h3><i>Disclosure
    of Confidential Information</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were no material facts in dispute with respect to
    the disclosure of confidential information to Mr. Grinshpan or with respect to
    the extent to which such disclosure had any impact on Emtwo, Abraham or Harry.  The undisputed evidence did not support a
    finding that Abraham had a reasonable expectation that Harry would keep all
    confidential Emtwo information from third parties.  I note in this regard that the Unanimous
    Shareholders’ Agreement was silent about the right of a shareholder to use
    confidential Emtwo information to obtain financing to fund the exercise of the Shotgun
    Provision.  Further, it was commercially
    unreasonable to expect that a third party lender would provide significant
    acquisition financing to a shareholder triggering the Shotgun Provision without
    financial confirmation of the value of the assets that were the subject of the
    transaction.  Indeed, Abraham himself
    provided confidential Emtwo information to third parties in order to obtain
    valuations of the Emtwo properties and the business for purposes of seeking <i>his own</i> financing in considering his options
    in responding to Harry’s offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the disclosure of confidential information did
    not constitute a breach of fiduciary obligation or oppressive conduct because
    there was no evidence of any harm or detriment to Emtwo or to Abraham, or of
    any benefit or profit to Harry, as a result of Harry’s disclosure of the
    confidential information to Mr. Grinshpan.  If the appellants were unable to establish any loss suffered by them, or
    any benefit or profit for Harry, there was no genuine issue for trial on an
    essential element of their claim.  </p>
  <h3><i>Deceit and
    Negligent Misrepresentation</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ claims for deceit and negligent
    misrepresentation failed for the same reason.  There is no evidence of any harm or detriment to Emtwo or to Abraham, or
    of any benefit or profit to Harry.</p>
  <h3><i>Mr. Grinshpan
    as a De Facto Director</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that by disclosing confidential
    Emtwo information to Mr. Grinshpan and by involving him in the decision-making
    process respecting the buy/sell transaction, Harry in effect constituted Mr. Grinshpan
    a <i>de facto</i> director of Emtwo,
    contrary to the Unanimous Shareholders’ Agreement.  This was also said to be a fiduciary breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This claim also fails for want of evidence on the
    detriment/benefit side.  In addition,
    however, the facts simply do not support the <i>de facto</i> director claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Unanimous Shareholders’ Agreement did not prevent
    Harry from consulting with anyone about the exercise of the shotgun
    provision.  There was no evidence that
    Harry had in any way fettered his discretion as a director or that Mr.
    Grinshpan dictated the position to be taken by Harry with respect to directors’
    decisions.  Indeed, the only decision the
    directors took during the relevant period was in relation to dealing with a
    Bloor Street lease, and in that regard – after discussions with Mr. Grinshpan –
    Harry advised that he was content to let Abraham, as managing director, deal
    with the property as Abraham thought fit.</p>
  <h3><i>Other Claims</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remaining claims asserted by the appellants are
    derivative of the foregoing causes of action in the sense that their success is
    dependent upon findings in favour of the appellants on issues rejected by the
    motion judge for the reasons summarized above.  These include the claims against the Grinshpan defendants.  I need not address them individually.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the context of the Shotgun Provision and the
    state of the record, the motion judge was entitled to hold that Abraham’s
    action should be dismissed.  In doing so,
    he did not impermissibly weigh evidence or draw inappropriate inferences.  While acknowledging that there were some
    facts in dispute, he concluded that those facts were not essential to the
    resolution of genuine issue for trial questions.   Whether there were genuine issues that
    required a trial for their resolution respecting the various causes of action
    alleged, could be determined – subject to the assumption dealt with above – by
    reference to undisputed material facts.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge Did Not Err in Deciding “Novel Issues”
    of Law</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the motion judge
    impermissibly “granted summary judgment on the basis of significant legal
    conclusions on novel or unsettled questions of law without the benefit of a
    full trial record”.  They make this
    submission in relation to three areas of law: (1) the duties of a
    shareholder/director in exercising a shotgun clause; (2) the law of fiduciary
    duty, duty of good faith and oppression, and corporate opportunity in the
    context of a shotgun clause; and (3) the availability of waiver of tort in
    respect of an action for deceit or misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal
    either.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Generally, courts are reluctant to determine unsettled
    matters of law at a pre-trial stage – including on motions for summary judgment
    – on the theory that new or important questions of law should not be determined
    on an incomplete factual record: <i>Société <span
class=SpellE>Générale</span></i>, at para. 51; <i><span lang=EN-US>Romano v. <span
class=SpellE>D’Onofrio</span></span></i><span lang=EN-US> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 583, at para. 7 (C.A.): <span class=SpellE><i>Bendix</i></span><i> Foreign Exchange Corp. v.

    as good a position a<span lang=EN-US>s the
    trial judge would be to do so, and is satisfied the only genuine issue is a

    v. <span class=SpellE>Rennie</span></i> (2007), 229 O.A.C. 320 (Div. Ct.), at
    para. 22; <i>Robinson v. Ottawa (City)</i> (2009), 55 M.P.L.R. (4th) 283 (Ont. S.C.), at paras. 63-64; <i>Alexis v. Toronto Police Services Board</i>,
    2009 ONCA 847, at para. 19.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the motion judge was justified in determining the
    legal issues presented to him, in my view.  They were not novel or unsettled, for the most part, and to the extent
    they may be considered “novel” – the claim in waiver of tort comes to mind –
    the motion judge had a sufficient factual foundation to permit their
    determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall again that the relationship between the parties
    is rooted in contract:  Harry exercised
    his rights under the Shotgun Provision.  Abraham
    says he acted wrongfully in the exercise of those rights.  What is essentially a complaint about failing
    to comply with the provisions of a contract is dressed up in the action as a
    claim for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of a duty of good faith, breach of
    confidentiality, oppression, misrepresentation, deceit, conspiracy and – if all
    else fails – waiver of tort.  There are
    times in litigation when the Shakespearean expression “the lady doth protest
    too much, methinks” has the ring of truth to it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts underlying all of these claims are the
    same.  And the motion judge was satisfied
    on the basis of the undisputed facts before him, together with facts that he
    assumed at their highest in favour of the plaintiffs, that none of these claims
    were made out.  Did he err in doing so
    because the claims were “novel” or “unsettled”?  In my opinion, he did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing either novel or unsettled about any of
    the foregoing causes of action, with the exception of “waiver of tort” (to which
    I will return).  It may be true that
    there is no specific jurisprudence on the question of the duties of a
    shareholder/director in the context of exercising a shotgun clause.  However, as the motion judge concluded, that
    alone is not enough to create a genuine issue for trial or to preclude summary
    judgment on unsettled law grounds, where it is clear there is no chance of
    success on the factual record, measured against established principles of
    law.  That was the case here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not a pleadings motion.  It was a motion for summary judgment.  As noted earlier in these Reasons, the motion
    judge had a very considerable record before him.  There had been full examinations for
    discovery prior to the motion and lengthy cross-examination on the affidavits
    filed in relation to it.  The motion
    judge thus knew all about the terms of the Unanimous Shareholders’ Agreement
    and the Loan Agreement, and the facts leading up to their execution.  He knew about the business, management and
    ownership structure of Emtwo.  He knew
    about the business and family relationship between Harry and Abraham, and about
    all the events that transpired during the relevant period.  As Harry’s counsel note in their factum, this
    was not a case where there were questions crucial to the analysis of the issues
    that were left unanswered on the record or where expert evidence was required.  There was no new evidence to be presented to a
    trial judge, and the mere prospect that some hoped-for nuance or subtlety might
    arise in the evidence should the matter go to trial does not turn an
    application of the facts to well-established legal principles into a “novel”
    exercise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that:</p>

    were all open to the motion judge based on the undisputed facts and the facts

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Waiver of tort”, on the other hand, qualifies as an
    uncertain area of the law, but it has no application on the facts of this case,
    in my view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Waiver of tort is a restitutionary remedy.  There is considerable controversy over
    whether it exists as an independent cause of action at all or whether it is “parasitic”
    in the sense that it requires proof of an underlying tort and – since a tort
    requires damage – proof of harm to the plaintiff.  By invoking waiver of tort, a plaintiff gives
    up the right to sue in tort but seeks to recover on the basis of restitution,
    claiming the benefits the wrongdoer has derived from the wrongful conduct
    regardless of whether the plaintiff has suffered damages or not. See, for
    example, <span class=SpellE><i>Serhan</i></span><i> Estate v. Johnson &amp; Johnson</i> (2006),

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim is not so much “novel” – it has its roots in
    the ancient action of <span class=SpellE><i>assumpsit</i></span> – as it is “mysterious” or “mystical”.  In
    their text, <i>The Law of Restitution</i>, <span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The
    doctrine known as “waiver of tort” is perhaps one of the lesser appreciated
    areas within the scope of the law of restitution. From the outset, it seems to
    have engendered an undue amount of confusion and needless complexity. The <i>almost mystical quality</i> that surrounds
    the doctrine is attested to by the following famous couplet penned by a pleader
    of old [J.L. <span class=SpellE>Adolphus</span>, “The <span class=SpellE>Circuiteers</span> – An Eclogue” (1885) 1 L.Q. Rev. 232, at p. 233]:</p>

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><br>
    When I <span class=SpellE><i>assumpsit</i></span> bring, and god-like waive a tort.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One source
    of this confusion stems from the doctrine's very name. As one writer has
    pointed out, not entirely facetiously, it has “<i>nothing whatever to do with waiver and really very little to with tort</i>”.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While waiver of

    example – it is of no assistance to the appellants here.  <span style='line-height:200%'>Whether the claim exists as an independent cause of action or
    whether it requires proof of all the elements of an underlying tort aside, at
    the very least, waiver of tort requires some form of wrongdoing.  The motion judge found none here.  No breach of contract.  No breach of fiduciary duty, or duty of good
    faith or confidentiality.  No
    oppression.  No misrepresentation.  No deceit.  No conspiracy</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>.  </span>As
    counsel for Mr. Grinshpan put it in their factum<span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'>, </span><span style='line-height:200%'>“its eleventh hour insertion into the statement of
    claim does not provide the appellants’ claim with a new lifeline given that the
    record discloses no wrongful conduct on the part of the respondents in respect
    of any of the causes of action pleaded</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Construction of the Loan Agreement</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the appellants’ central contentions is that the
    Loan Agreement was not merely a loan agreement but was instead – or as well –
    an agreement of purchase and sale respecting the Emtwo properties that were to
    be transferred to Mr. Grinshpan upon completion of the transaction.  Mr. Leon argues that the motion judge erred
    by construing the Loan Agreement as a personal financing loan to Harry because,
    in doing so, he favoured one reasonable inference on disputed facts over
    another – something that a summary judgment motion judge is not to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge did not improperly “construe” the Loan
    Agreement in my view.  There was no
    dispute between the parties as to what was agreed to between Harry and Mr.
    Grinshpan.  The terms of the Loan
    Agreement were not ambiguous.  There was
    no dispute over what the parties did or did not do.  As the motion judge recognized, the
    subjective intentions of Harry and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Grinsphan</span> were
    irrelevant in this regard.  The motion
    judge’s characterization of the Loan Agreement was accurate, and was properly based
    on the undisputed facts before the court.</p>
