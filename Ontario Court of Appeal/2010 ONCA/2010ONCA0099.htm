style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Ayele Admassu (“Admassu”),
    appeals from the order of the motion judge striking his statement of claim
    against the respondent solicitor, Anthony Macri (“Macri”), pursuant to rule
    21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 on the ground that it discloses no
    reasonable cause of action.  For the
    reasons that follow, I agree that Admassu’s pleading fails to set out an
    actionable claim against Macri.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>I.         Background</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Child Protection Proceeding</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Macri is a barrister and solicitor licensed to
    practise law in Ontario.  For several
    years, he represented the Children’s Aid Society of Toronto (the “CAS”) in a
    child protection proceeding involving Admassu and E.Y., the mother of Admassu’s
    daughter, “M.<span class=GramE>”.</span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 20, 2006, the CAS commenced a child
    protection application in the Ontario Court of Justice seeking a declaration
    that M. was a child in need of protection pursuant to Part III of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.11 (the “Act”).  Admassu and
    E.Y. were named as respondents in the application.  Macri acted as counsel for the CAS throughout
    the child protection proceeding, appearing on its behalf on various motions and
    other court attendances, both in the Ontario Court of Justice and the Superior
    Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several pre-trial motions ensued between the parties
    regarding interim custody of, and access to, the child, M.  Eventually, by order of H.K. Katarynych J. of
    the Ontario Court of Justice, dated November 1, 2006, M. was placed in the
    temporary care and custody of her mother, E.Y., subject to supervision by the
    CAS.  Under the terms of the same order,
    Admassu was granted supervised access rights to his daughter no less than twice
    per week at M.’s daycare facility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial of the child protection application was
    heard before D. Paulseth J. of the Ontario Court of Justice over six days,
    commencing on June 25, 2007 and ultimately ending on August 30, 2007.  By judgment dated August 30, 2007, the
    application judge found that M. was a child in need of protection under s. 37(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b)(i) of the Act and made a final order placing her in the
    care and custody of her mother, E.Y., subject to supervision by the CAS for a
    period of six months on specified terms and conditions.  Admassu was granted supervised access to his
    daughter on terms set by the application judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>E.Y., supported by all involved child protection
    professionals, consented to this disposition.  Admassu opposed it.  He sought
    sole custody of his daughter, with open access to E.Y.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Admassu’s subsequent appeal from the application
    judge’s decision was dismissed by G. Czutrin J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice, on January 29, 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Admassu’s further appeal to this court was
    dismissed in a brief endorsement by the court, dated October 10, 2008: 2008
    ONCA 695, leave to appeal refused, [2009] S.C.C.A. No. 113.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since H.K. Katarynych J.’s order of November 1,
    2006, M. has remained in the care and custody of E.Y., subject to supervised
    access rights in Admassu’s favour.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Action <span class=GramE>Against</span> Macri</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following the application judge’s decision,
    Admassu sued several lawyers, including E.Y.’s lawyer and a duty counsel at the
    Ontario Court of Justice, alleging improprieties by them during the trial of
    the child protection proceeding.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  As relevant to this appeal, Admassu commenced
    a lawsuit against Macri on August 14, 2008, claiming damages in the sum of $7
    million for various alleged criminal and unprofessional acts, including conspiracy,
    fraud, deceit, perjury and breach of trust.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Macri delivered a statement of defence dated
    September 11, 2008, in which he expressly denied that he had engaged in any
    criminal or other wrongful acts, as asserted by Admassu.  Macri also claimed that Admassu’s statement
    of claim failed to disclose any reasonable cause of action against him.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Motion
    to Strike</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following the exchange of pleadings, Macri moved
    for an order under rule 21.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, striking Admassu’s
    statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of
    action against him.  By order dated March
    25, 2009, the requested relief was granted by the motion judge and Admassu’s
    pleading was struck.    Macri was also
    awarded his costs of the motion, fixed in the sum of $4,500, payable forthwith.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge indicated that Admassu was
    suing Macri on essentially two grounds: (i) for allegedly making false
    statements to a judge in court; and (ii) for allegedly commissioning one or
    more affidavits, the contents of which Macri knew to be false or misleading,
    during the child protection proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge concluded that no civil cause
    of action existed for either of these complaints against Macri.  He reasoned in part that: “(1) what lawyers
    say in court is accorded absolute privilege … and (2) that the remedy for
    swearing a false affidavit (or indeed commissioning same) is to prosecute
    criminally for perjury (or aiding perjury).”  In the result, in the motion judge’s view, Admassu’s pleading failed to
    disclose a reasonable cause of action against Macri.</p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although expressed somewhat differently in the
    appellant’s notice of appeal and factum, the sole issue on this appeal is
    whether the motion judge erred by concluding that Admassu’s pleading fails to
    disclose a reasonable cause of action against Macri.</p>
  <h2>III.      Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I share the motion
    judge’s opinion that Admassu’s statement of claim does not disclose a
    reasonable cause of action against Macri.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is difficult to discern Admassu’s precise
    complaints against Macri from his statement of claim.  On a generous reading of the claim, however,
    his allegations against Macri involve assertions of: (i) a conspiracy between
    Macri and others to cover up mistakes said to have been made by the CAS (paras.
    4, 6 and 9(d)) and to force the child protection application on to trial (paras.
    8(w) to (y).  See also paras. 18 and 20.);
    (ii) the commissioning of affidavits by Macri that he knew to be false or
    misleading (paras. 8(c) and (y), 9(a) and 17); (iii) fraudulent
    “Action/omission” of an unspecified nature by Macri and an accomplice that
    Admassu says caused him to lose custody of his daughter (paras. 8(g) and 20);
    (iv) perjury and deceit by Macri when informing the court of the nature of
    matters pending before the court, of some of the procedural history of the
    dispute between the parties, and of the outcome of some of the steps taken in
    the child protection proceeding (paras. 4, 8(o), (p), (q), (r), (t) and (w) and
    20); (v) fraud (paras. 4, 8(y), 9(a), 17, 18 and 20); and (vi) breach of trust
    (para. 20).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During oral argument before this court, Admassu’s
    complaints against Macri became more focused.  In essence, he argues that Macri, acting alone or in concert with
    others, lied to the court during the child protection proceeding, or
    commissioned false affidavits used in that <span class=GramE>proceeding</span> that misrepresented the facts, concerning, in particular, E.Y.’s prior
    assertion that Admassu had physically and emotionally abused her.  Admassu contends that this alleged misconduct
    by Macri, which underlies all his claims against Macri as pleaded, resulted in
    Admassu’s loss of the custody of his daughter and the imposition of supervised
    access terms.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would reject this contention for several
    reasons.  First, as a general matter, I
    agree with the motion judge that statements made by legal counsel and evidence
    filed in court attract the protection of absolute privilege.  See for example, <i>Samuel Manu-Tech Inc. v. Redipac Recycling Corp.</i> (1999), 124 O.A.C.
    125, at paras. 13-21; <i>Munster v. Lamb</i> (1883), 11 Q.B.D. 588 (C.A.), at pp. 600-02 and 605.  For this reason, Admassu’s complaints about
    alleged in-court misrepresentations, in the form of statements by Macri or
    false affidavits said to have been commissioned by him, do not give rise to a
    reasonable cause of action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, and importantly, the record of the child
    protection proceeding does not support Admassu’s claims of impropriety by
    Macri.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>E.Y. and Admassu both testified before the
    application judge.  The record before the
    application judge also included the testimony of the involved daycare
    supervisor, various medical records concerning E.Y.’s condition and treatment,
    and affidavits sworn by CAS family and children’s service workers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to Admassu’s contention, none of the
    affidavits filed with the application judge was commissioned by Macri.  The only affidavit commissioned by Macri,
    which was sworn by a CAS worker, post-dates the application judge’s
    decision.  It was prepared for the
    purpose of Admassu’s appeal of that decision and contains no reference to
    alleged abuse of E.Y. by Admassu.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, there is no indication in the
    application judge’s reasons that she relied on any factual representations by
    counsel, including Macri, in arriving at her decision regarding custody and
    access.  On the contrary, her reasons
    reveal that the determination of the custodial placement that was in M.’s best
    interests was based on her evaluation of both E.Y.’s and Admassu’s credibility,
    as well as the medical and CAS evidence before her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge’s assessment of Admassu’s
    credibility was not favourable.  As her
    findings concerning his credibility and fitness to serve as M.’s custodial
    parent are blunt and unambiguous, it is useful to quote some of them in
    detail.  The application judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is very clear from his evidence, that the father
    blames the mother for her illness, which of course, is not her fault and
    exacerbated her condition through confusing information about second and third
    opinions and avoiding certain hospitals and the Society.  It is also very clear that the father does
    not value … the efforts of the mother to maintain her good mental health and
    her relationship with her infant through the rigors of the current temporary <span
class=GramE>order,</span> I will speak more about this as part of
    disposition.  Finally the clear fact that
    the father’s priority was not for the safety of this child when the mother was
    ill supports this finding … <i>The father’s
    position that the child should be placed with him is clearly on all the
    evidence based on his own need to control the situation and the mother, in
    particular and has nothing remotely to merit it as being in [M.’s] best
    interest … It is the evidence and the submissions of the father that he has
    really been a victim throughout this matter.</i> His examples, the mother’s
    lies about their relationship and the timing of the marriage.  The foster family’s abuse of his daughter,
    firstly by dislocating her leg and several times thereafter he observed
    bruises.  <i>On all occasions, I should add, that medical reports substantiate
    totally innocent conditions.</i> <span class=GramE>A victim of his lawyers
    about which I will say nothing.</span>  He
    has criticized the Hospital for Sick Children for diagnosing his child on the
    basis of insufficient examination.  <span
class=GramE>Criticism of the psychia-trist for their [<i>sic</i>] failures in his wife’s treatment.</span>  <span class=GramE>Criticism of the mother’s
    condition for indirectly influencing his daughter’s current behaviour.</span>  She is almost two now and not as immediately
    responsive to his suggestions during visits.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Elsewhere in her reasons, the application judge
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The father has been offered visits twice per week
    from two until four, usually Monday and Friday’s at the daycare.  From November until April he would arrive
    generally between 2:30 and 3 in the afternoon and leave around 4.  Since April until the current time he’s often
    arrived after 3 and has only ever phoned once to say that he would be late
    because of traffic.  Unlike the mother,
    the father has never engaged any questions about the child’s development.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Admassu testified that he was fully capable of
    caring for his daughter, although in cross examination he did not appear to
    know much about her stages of development or her daily routines.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These key credibility-based findings do not
    support a custodial disposition in favour of Admassu.  On the contrary, they support the application
    judge’s conclusion that M.’s best interests required that she remain in her
    mother’s care and custody. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I have said, Admassu submits that Macri
    misled the court, either by his in-court statements or through the use of false
    affidavits commissioned by him, concerning E.Y.’s claim that Admassu had
    physically and emotionally abused her.  He says that, as a result, he was denied custody of his daughter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, Admassu’s pleading does not refer to
    these serious, specific allegations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, the record and the application
    judge’s reasons again undercut this claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that the application judge held: “It
    is also the evidence before this trial that the mother has been emotionally
    abused and probably physically abused by this man.”  It is also true that the affidavits of the
    CAS representatives contained particulars of this claimed abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But apart from the CAS affidavits, there was
    other evidence before the application judge that amply supported her finding of
    abuse.  First, E.Y.’s medical records provided
    some confirmatory evidence of her claim of physical and emotional abuse at the
    hands of Admassu.  Second, E.Y. herself
    detailed her allegation of such abuse in her testimony before the application
    judge.  While she acknowledged that she
    had previously recanted her assertion of abuse, E.Y. explained that she had
    done so because Admassu told her, following her hospitalization for a
    breakdown, that she would never get her baby back unless she returned to live
    with him and denied the abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge was alive to E.Y.’s
    various and differing accounts of abuse by Admassu.  She noted that E.Y. “admits now to changing
    her story only to get her baby back”.  After reviewing both E.Y.’s and Admassu’s evidence, the application
    judge accepted E.Y.’s testimony on this issue, holding:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The mother’s testimony about the occasions about the
    physical abuse was detailed and very persuasive.  The father’s denials were very vague and
    grandiose.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge further held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Admassu] manipulated their relationship in a
    shameless manner, in the face of [E.Y.’s] strict adherence and belief in a
    religious marriage laws [<i>sic</i>].  He controlled her movements and finances to
    an unbearable degree, this stress, the mother has now learned, probably
    [exacerbated] her underlying mental health condition.  He did not support the medical opinions
    recommending medication for her at a critical time. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These findings were open to the application
    judge on E.Y.’s testimony and the medical evidence.  They were not dependent, nor do the reasons
    suggest that they were grounded, on any representations made by trial counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a third and significant ground on which
    to conclude that Admassu’s pleading does not give rise to a reasonable cause of
    action against Macri.  This concerns the
    deficiencies in the pleading itself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Admassu alleges conspiracy, fraud and
    perjury against Macri, his statement of claim fails to plead those material
    facts on which he relies to support these serious allegations.  In this respect, Admassu’s claim fails to
    conform <span class=GramE>with</span> the rules of pleading set out under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>: see rules
    25.06(1) and 25.06(8).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, Admassu’s statement of claim contains
    bald allegations of breach of trust and deceit.  In contravention of the rules of pleading, the claim fails to set out the
    necessary elements of an action for breach of trust or deceit, and the material
    facts or particulars on which such causes of action could be based: see rule
    25.06(8).  To the extent that these
    claims are based on Macri’s alleged perjury or misrepresentations in the trial
    of the child protection application or related proceedings, they fail to
    disclose a reasonable cause of action for the reasons that I have already
    outlined.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, in respect of Admassu’s allegation of
    perjury by Macri, the motion judge held that as a matter of law, Admassu’s
    remedy, if any, lies in the criminal rather than the civil law domain, and that
    no civil cause of action exists for this claim.  I agree.</p>
  <h2>IV.      Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would
    dismiss the appeal.  I would award Macri
    his costs of the appeal, fixed in the amount of $3,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.</p>

    Admassu asserted claims similar to those advanced by him against Macri in the
    present case.  Admassu’s statement of
    claim in that lawsuit was struck by order of T. R. Lederer J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice, dated March 4, 2009, on the grounds that the action was
    frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process.  On appeal by Admassu to this court, the
    motion judge’s decision to strike was upheld: <i>Admassu v. Degago</i>, 2009 ONCA 673.  Admassu’s additional lawsuit against duty counsel at the family branch
    of the Ontario Court of Justice was similarly dismissed on pre-trial motion:
    see <i>Admassu v. Ontario (Court of Justice
    Family Branch)</i>, 2009 ONCA 226, leave to appeal refused, [2009] S.C.C.A. No.
