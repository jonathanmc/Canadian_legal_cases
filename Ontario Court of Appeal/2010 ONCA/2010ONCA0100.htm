  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Besley Waugh was convicted twice in the year 2000 of
    obstructing police.  Both convictions
    arose out of incidents in which the vehicle he was driving was properly stopped
    by police for road safety purposes.  On
    each occasion Mr. Waugh failed to produce proof of valid insurance and was
    “uncooperative” with police.  He seeks to
    have those convictions set aside.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Waugh and Police Constable Churkoo appear to
    frequent the same roadways.</p>
  <h3><i>The First
    Incident</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 3, 1999, P.C. Churkoo was on foot patrol in
    the Eglinton Ave. and Keele St. area of Toronto.  He observed a rusted Pontiac vehicle that
    appeared to be in poor condition and did not have a front licence plate.  He instructed the driver, Mr.&nbsp;Waugh, to
    stop and pull over.  In response to a
    request to do so, Mr. Waugh was unable to produce either a driver’s licence, a
    valid vehicle permit, or proof of valid insurance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer believed (correctly, as it turned out) that
    the vehicle was uninsured.  He advised Mr.
    Waugh that the vehicle would be impounded and a tow truck was summoned.  A CPIC search by another officer revealed that
    Mr. Waugh had three previous convictions for operating a vehicle without
    insurance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Waugh refused to get out of the car.  Instead, he locked himself in and asked that
    a supervisor be called.  This was done
    and, while they were all waiting, P.C.&nbsp;Churkoo served Mr. Waugh with several
    provincial offence notices.  Shortly
    thereafter, while still waiting for the supervisor to arrive, Mr. Waugh started
    the car and began to drive away.  Pursued
    by the police, he ultimately turned off the road and parked the car in a
    private laneway about 150 to 250 metres away from the point where he had been
    stopped.  Because the vehicle was parked
    on private property and not on a highway, the police were unable to tow it
    away.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Waugh was then charged with the offence of obstruct
    police on the basis that he had failed to follow the police instructions not to
    move the vehicle and had prevented them from properly towing the uninsured
    vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Waugh`s explanation was that once he had received
    the offence notices he thought he was free to drive off, and had done so.  Justice Khoorshed rejected this evidence.</p>
  <h3><i>The
    Second Incident </i></h3>
  <h3> </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 1, 1999, P.C. Churkoo was again on foot
    patrol, this time in the area of Davenport Rd. and Osler St. in Toronto.  Again, he noticed a vehicle approaching that
    appeared to be in poor condition – it was rusted, the suspension was not
    proper, and the vehicle was leaning to one side – and it lacked a front licence
    plate.  Again, he signalled for the
    vehicle to stop.  Again, the vehicle was
    driven by Mr. Waugh.  And again,
    Mr.&nbsp;Waugh was uncooperative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Waugh refused to stop when initially requested to
    do so.  As P.C. Churkoo approached the
    vehicle to instruct the driver to pull over, Mr. Waugh put the vehicle in
    motion, veered to the right, drove around the officer, and proceeded along the street.  P.C.&nbsp;Churkoo repeatedly called for Mr.
    Waugh to stop, but Mr. Waugh proceeded to turn into a laneway designated by the
    City as a fire route.  Eventually, Mr.
    Waugh did stop, but not before driving within an arm’s length of the police
    officer who was tapping on the hood, saying, “[s]top, Mr. Waugh.  Stop the vehicle.  I’m stopping you.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This time, when he finally did stop, Mr. Waugh was able
    to produce a valid driver’s licence and vehicle ownership permit, but he did
    not produce proof of insurance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P.C. Churkoo had stopped Mr. Waugh on one other
    occasion since the March 3, 1999 incident (on April 4, 1999) when Mr. Waugh was
    again unable to provide proof of insurance.  He therefore recognized the appellant from his
    previous experiences and suspected that the vehicle was uninsured.  Following the March 3 incident, P.C. Churkoo
    had made some inquiries about Mr. Waugh at the Ministry of Transportation and
    the Financial Services Commission.  These
    inquiries revealed that Mr. Waugh had obtained his vehicle validation sticker
    by pretending to be insured by a company – “Your Own Insurance Company” – that
    did not exist.  P.C. Churkoo informed Mr.
    Waugh they would seize his licence plate (a dealer plate) which was displayed
    inside the vehicle on the rear window.  He also informed Mr. Waugh that his car would be impounded, and a tow
    truck was summoned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After some resistance, Mr. Waugh got out of the vehicle
    through the passenger side door and then quickly slammed the door, locking the
    keys inside the car, thus preventing the police from seizing his licence plate.  Again, Mr. Waugh was arrested for the offence
    of obstruct police.</p>
  <h3><i>The
    Proceedings</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 30, 2000, Justice Khoorshed convicted Mr. Waugh
    of obstructing police in relation to the first incident.  On July 29, 2000, Justice Belobradic
    convicted him of obstructing police in relation to the second incident.  In both cases, the trial judges accepted the
    evidence of the police officers and rejected that of Mr. Waugh.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five years later – on May 12, 2005 – Justice Dyson of
    the Superior Court of Justice dismissed his summary conviction appeals.  Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
    March 16, 2009.  At the same time, Mr. Di
    Luca was appointed counsel for Mr. Waugh pursuant to s. 684 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Mr. Di Luca raised a number of issues on
    appeal, his principal submission was that the police officers were not engaged
    in the lawful execution of their duties at the time of the original
    arrests.  Therefore, the offence of obstruct
    police has not been made out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The argument rests on two pillars.  First – in relation to the March 3, 1999
    incident – Mr. Di Luca submits that, having properly served Mr. Waugh with
    valid provincial offence notices, the police had no further authority to
    impound the uninsured vehicle.  It
    follows that they had no authority to require Mr. Waugh to get out of the
    vehicle.  He could therefore not have
    been obstructing the police by failing to do so.  Secondly – in relation to the November 1, 1999
    incident – he submits that the police had no authority (a) to impound the
    vehicle, for the same reasons set out above, or (b) to seize the licence plate
    because the vehicle was uninsured and they had no basis for believing in the
    circumstances that the licence plate had been improperly obtained.  In the end, says Mr.&nbsp;Di Luca, the police
    are not entitled to enforce the provisions of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, through the obstruct
    justice provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant portions of s. 129 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Every one who</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>resists</span> or
    wilfully obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his
    duty or any person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer, ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>is</span> guilty of</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) <span class=GramE>an</span> indictable offence
    and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) <span class=GramE>an</span> offence
    punishable on summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interesting question raised on this appeal is
    whether police officers, in the exercise of their legitimate duties under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, have the authority
    to cause a vehicle to be removed from the highway, or to seize its licence
    plates at the roadside, when they reasonably believe the vehicle is uninsured.  If they do not, then – subject to a further
    issue relating to the validity of the plate respecting the second issue, to
    which I will return – Mr. Waugh could not have been guilty of obstructing them
    in the execution of their duties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peace officers act in the execution of their duty only
    if exercising a power conferred by statute or by common law: <i>R. v. Dedman</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p.
    28.  Mr.&nbsp;Di Luca argues that neither
    source of authority assists the Crown here.</p>
  <h3><i>Statutory
    Power</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the police power to impound a vehicle
    reasonably believed to be uninsured does not derive from statute.  Nothing in the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> or the <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. C.25, gives that authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Stuart submits the power may be found in subsection
    221(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>,
    which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A police officer or an officer appointed for
    carrying out the provisions of this Act who discovers a vehicle apparently
    abandoned on or near a highway or a motor vehicle or trailer without proper
    plates may take the vehicle into custody of the law and may cause it to be
    taken to and stored in a suitable place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her argument goes like this.  A vehicle must be insured to be operated
    lawfully on a highway in Ontario: <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i>, s. 2(1); <i>R.
    v. Zwicker</i> (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 171 (C.A.).  If a vehicle cannot lawfully be driven, it becomes unusable and,
    therefore, effectively becomes abandoned.  Abandoned – amongst other things – means “left empty or unused”: <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i>, 2d ed., <i>s.v.</i> “abandoned”.  An unusable and therefore “unused” vehicle
    that in effect becomes “abandoned” falls within the parameters of s. 221(1),
    and the police accordingly have discretion to take it into custody and cause it
    to be taken away to safe storage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The submission is clever but untenable, in my
    view.  To say that Mr. Waugh’s vehicle
    was “<i>left</i> empty or unused” and
    therefore “abandoned” when in fact he insisted on remaining in it and (in the
    case of the first incident) actually drove off in it, would be stretching even
    the modern and flexible “purposive and contextual” approach to statutory
    interpretation too far.  Mr. Waugh’<span
lang=EN-US>s</span> vehicle was not abandoned.</p>
  <h3><i>Common Law</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither the <i>Police
    Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15 nor, as mentioned above, the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> or the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i>,
    expressly provide the police with authority to impound a vehicle reasonably
    believed to be uninsured.  I am persuaded,
    nonetheless – as Ms. Stuart argued in the alternative – that the police had the
    authority to stop and impound Mr. Waugh’s vehicle based on powers inherent in
    the execution of their common law duties.  Those duties include the preservation of the peace, the prevention of
    crime and the protection of life and property, from which is derived the duty
    to control traffic on the public roads: <i>Dedman</i>,
    at p. 32.  The thrust of these duties is
    reflected in s. 42 of the <i>Police Services
    Act</i> as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dedman</i>,<i> </i>the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the
    test set out in <i>R. v. Waterfield</i>,
    [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A.), at p. 661, in determining the extent to which
    the police are authorized by common law to interfere with the liberty and
    property of individuals.  The <i>Waterfield </i>test is case specific but
    involves ascertaining:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) [Whether the police conduct in
    question] falls within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute or
    recognized at common law; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>whether</span> such conduct, albeit within the general scope of such a duty, involved an
    unjustifiable use of powers associated with the duty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It may be true – as Mr. Di Luca contends – that the
    common law has never explicitly recognized the authority of the police to tow a
    vehicle as deriving from their general police duties.  However, I see no reason why that should not
    be the case provided the <i>Dedman/Waterfield </i>test is met in the circumstances and provided the police act reasonably and
    prudently.  Here, in my view, the test is
    met and the police acted reasonably and prudently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P.C. Churkoo and his companion officers were attempting
    to enforce the provisions of the <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i>, acting on a reasonable belief, in both incidents,
    that Mr. Waugh’s vehicle was not insured.  They were also acting pursuant to their common law duty to protect the
    life and property of the public and to ensure the safety of the roadways.  The first branch of the test is satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the use of the power justifiable in the
    circumstances, as required by the second branch?  In my opinion, it was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An uninsured vehicle has no right to be on a public
    highway in Ontario.  The police had a
    reasonable belief that Mr. Waugh’s vehicle was uninsured.  What were they to do?  If they permitted the uninsured vehicle to
    continue to be driven on the highway, they ran the risk of an accident occurring
    and of someone being seriously injured or killed without the benefit of the
    safety network envisaged by the <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i>.  If they
    did not permit the vehicle to be driven away – and it remained on the highway without
    being towed – it would constitute a hazard.  The ability to impound the vehicle and have it towed away, in the
    circumstances, is a reasonable exercise of the police common law duty to
    prevent crime (the commission of further insurance-related driving offences),
    to protect the life and property of the public, and to control traffic on the
    public roads.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Di Luca contends that the operation of motor
    vehicles is subject to a highly regulated and comprehensive statutory regime
    establishing the powers of the police and the penalties for violating this scheme.  By failing to provide express statutory
    authority for the police to tow uninsured vehicles in these circumstances, the legislature
    has signalled a clear choice that the police are not to have such a power.  This is particularly so where the legislature
    has chosen to provide express towing powers in other circumstances.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The court should be reluctant, therefore, to
    fill in the gap by resort to the ancillary powers of police at common law, he
    submits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this argument is somewhat convincing, it cannot
    carry the day in my view.  I accept that
    courts should be cautious in extending police power by resort to their common
    law ancillary powers, particularly in circumstances where the legislature has
    put in place an elaborate and comprehensive regulatory regime with carefully
    balanced powers and sanctions.  However, the
    compulsory automobile insurance scheme enacted in Ontario is an important
    lynch-pin in the overall regime to promote the safety and well-being of the
    public on the highways: see <i>R. v.
    Ladouceur</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, per Cory&nbsp;J., at para. 44.  It does so by attempting to ensure that, when
    accidents occur, there is a financial safety network in place to support those
    who sustain personal injury or property damage, and their families.  That regime, and the role compulsory
    insurance plays in it, can only be reasonably protected if the police have the
    authority to cause uninsured vehicles to be removed from public highways and
    towed to safety in certain circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it must be remembered that, while the right to
    circulate in a motor vehicle on the public highway is considered a “liberty”
    for purposes of the constitutional debate surrounding motor vehicle
    legislation, as the Supreme Court of Canada noted in <i>Dedman</i>, at p. 35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In assessing the interference with this right … one
    must bear in mind … that the right is not a fundamental liberty like the
    ordinary right of movement of the individual, <i>but a licenced activity that is subject to regulation and control for
    the protection and life of the public</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus – while it will depend upon the circumstances of
    the case whether the police were acting in accordance with their common law
    duties as measured through the parameters of the <i>Dedman/Waterfield</i> test – permitting the police to cause an
    uninsured vehicle to be impounded and towed to safety falls squarely within the
    exercise of their duty to protect the life and property of the public.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These factors outweigh the concern for caution in
    extending police powers through resort to their common law duties in
    circumstances such as these.</p>
  <h3><i>Obstructing
    Police</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, since the police were engaged in “the
    lawful execution of their duties” when attempting to impound Mr. Waugh’s vehicle
    in both instances, it was a question of fact whether his actions sufficiently frustrated
    the police efforts to constitute an offence under s. 129 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Both trial judges concluded they did, and the
    summary conviction appeal judge was correct in not interfering with their
    conclusions.</p>
  <h3><i>Were the Police Attempting to Use
    the Criminal Code Indirectly to Enforce Provincial Legislation?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Waugh mounts an additional argument.  He submits that even if the police were
    acting in the execution of their duties by attempting to enforce the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> and the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i>, the
    charge of obstruct police under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> was not open to them, given the presence of more moderate means of
    enforcement: see <i>R v. Sharma</i>, [1993]
    1 S.C.R. 650; <i>R v. Hayes</i> (2003), 65
    O.R. (3d) 787 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No.
    435.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Sharma</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada held that while the police have a general duty to
    enforce the law, police officers did not have a common law right to arrest and
    charge a flower vendor with obstruct police for repeatedly ignoring the
    officers demands to remove his wares from the street where he was operating
    without a licence, contrary to a city by-law.  The legislation defined the enforcement power as ticketing the
    vendor.  There is a significant
    difference, however, between the police duty to enforce a by-law against <span
class=SpellE>unlicenced</span> street vendors and the police duty to enforce
    road safety in order to protect the life, well-being and safety of the public,
    as is the case here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hayes</i> involved an obstruct police charge laid in the context of a motorcyclist’s
    refusal to remove his helmet for inspection upon an officer’s request pursuant
    to s. 82 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  Subsection 82(3) of that <i>Act</i> addressed precisely the same problem, however, by providing for
    the imposition of a fine in such circumstances.  McMurtry C.J.O. accordingly concluded, at para. 42, that “precisely the
    same misconduct” – that is, the refusal to submit the helmet for inspection –
    could not form the basis for a charge of obstruct police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both s. 23 of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> and s. 2 of the <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i> provide for fines as a means of enforcing the
    requirement that motor vehicles be insured.  Neither statute provides for the power of arrest.  Therefore, Mr.&nbsp;Waugh contends, a police
    officer’s power to enforce the statutes is limited to issuing tickets, as was
    the case in <i>Hayes</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, however, the “precisely the same conduct”
    analogy does not fit here.  The police
    were not attempting to use the obstruct police charge to enforce the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> offences for which Mr.
    Waugh had already been ticketed, in relation to the first incident.  Those tickets did not capture the offence
    committed, which was to interfere with the police officers’ efforts to impound
    the vehicle and have it towed away. Nor, with respect to the second incident,
    were they attempting to enforce the “fail to stop” requirements of s. 216 of
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  The offence of obstruct police, in that instance,
    was founded on Mr. Waugh’s attempts to frustrate both the towing of the vehicle
    and the investigation regarding the validity of the licence plate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in neither incident was there any evidence
    that the police were attempting to utilize the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for punitive
    purposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal must fail.</p>
  <h3><i>The November 1, 1999 Incident:
    Police Investigation of the Licence Plate</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foregoing is sufficient to dispose of the
    appeal.  There is a further basis upon
    which the conviction in relation to the November 1, 1999 incident should be
    upheld, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police charged Mr. Waugh with obstruction in
    relation to the second incident on two bases.  First, he failed to stop his vehicle when instructed to do so.  But secondly – and importantly – he
    intentionally locked his keys in the vehicle, thus preventing them from seizing
    his licence plate and investigating its validity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall that P.C. Churkoo and Mr. Waugh were somewhat acquainted
    by this time.  It was the third occasion
    on which Mr. Waugh had been stopped by P.C. Churkoo on similar grounds.  In the meantime, following the first
    incident, P.C. Churkoo had made enquiries of the Ministry of Transportation and
    the Financial Services Commission.  He
    was informed that Mr. Waugh had obtained his vehicle permit by certifying that
    he was insured by a non-existent insurance company – “<span class=GramE>Your</span> Own Insurance Company.”  He had a
    reasonable belief, therefore, that the vehicle plate or its validation sticker
    may have been obtained by false pretences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On that basis, P.C. Churkoo was entitled to seize the
    plate that was located in the rear window of Mr. Waugh’s vehicle in order to
    investigate whether the plate or validation sticker had been obtained by means
    of a false statement in a certificate of insurance used to obtain it, contrary
    to subsection 13(2) of the <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 13 of that <i>Act </i>states as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       Every
    person making an application for the issuance, validation or transfer of a
    permit for a motor vehicle shall certify, in the form prescribed by the
    regulations, that the motor vehicle is insured under a contract of automobile
    insurance and the Registrar, despite subsection 7(7) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, shall not issue,
    validate or transfer the permit for the motor vehicle, where such certificate
    of insurance is not provided to the Registrar.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       No
    person shall knowingly make a false statement in the certificate of insurance
    required under subsection (1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 14(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> permits a police officer to seize a vehicle licence
    plate or evidence of validation of a permit if the officer has reasonable
    grounds to believe the number plate or evidence of validation of a permit was
    obtained by false pretences.  This is
    what the police were attempting to do on November 1, 1999, when Mr. Waugh hastily
    jumped out the passenger side of his vehicle – the opposite side from where the
    police were standing – and locked the doors with the keys inside, thus
    frustrating their attempts to seize the plate.  He is guilty of obstructing the police in the execution of their lawful
    duty on this basis as well.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeals
