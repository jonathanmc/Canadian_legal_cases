    Nordic gave 139 notice that it was not renewing the agreement and a week later

    139 was not fulfilling its obligations under the agreement.</span></p>

    the language of Article 20 was unequivocal and found that Nordic’s decision not
    to renew was a breach of the term of the agreement.  She found that “a
    reasonable notice period [was] not applicable” in the circumstances and awarded
    139 damages for the loss of profits for an 11-year period less a discount of 15
    per cent for contingencies.</span></p>

    that Nordic breached Article 22 of the agreement which provides in part:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>22.  The Association [Nordic] will
    grant the Company [139] the first right of refusal to bid on any other OTB
    location in St. Catharines.</span></p>

    entered into the agreement with 139, Nordic entered into another memorandum of
    understanding with a third party to operate what would in effect be a competing
    OTB location in St. Catharines.  Nordic did not give 139 an opportunity to bid
    on that location.  To account for the loss of revenue resulting from the
    competing operation, the trial judge awarded damages for this breach by increasing
    the revenues in her calculation of the loss of profits for 139’s operations.  In
    this manner, the trial judge integrated the damages resulting from the two
    breaches into a single award for the loss of profits.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Nordic does not appeal
    liability.  It argues, however, that the trial judge erred in her damages award
    in two ways.  First, she erred in awarding damages based on the loss of profits
    for an 11-year period.  Second, she erred in calculating the loss of profits,
    in particular: by failing to deduct the costs of sales from revenues, by
    failing to impute a wage for the principals of 139 at least at the statutory
    minimum wage and by failing to calculate part-time wages in accordance with the
    evidence.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The 11-year Period</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    erred in awarding damages for an 11-year period. It is Nordic’s position that
    the trial judge concluded that the agreement was neither for a fixed term, nor
    was it perpetual. Thus, it contends that the agreement must be terminable on
    reasonable notice.  Nordic asserts that the trial judge did not apply the
    principles found in cases involving damages in lieu of reasonable notice to
    determine the correct period for the assessment of damages. An 11-year damages
    period is significantly beyond what the case law suggests.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>139 argues that the
    wording of Article 20 provides for a perpetual agreement and that the trial
    judge found such an agreement.  In support of this argument, 139 relies on the
    wording of Article 20, as well as, the fact that 139 invested significant
    amounts of money in the premises solely to accommodate Nordic’s OTB operation. 
    Further, 139 points to Article 13 of the agreement which provides for
    termination by either party on 30 days written notice if events occur that
    would frustrate the performance of the agreement such as Nordic losing its OTB
    licence, 139 losing its liquor licence or either party having significant
    operating losses in any one year.  139 argues that because the parties included
    a provision for termination in some circumstances, the court should not imply a
    reasonable notice provision for termination in others.  Thus, it contends that
    the parties agreed that, absent the occurrence of the specific events set out
    in Article 13, the agreement was to run in perpetuity.  </span></p>

    recognized the competing positions of the parties.  While she did not expressly
    state that the agreement was perpetual in nature, it is implicit in her reasons
    that she concluded it was.  She rejected Nordic’s submission that she should
    imply a reasonable notice provision for termination into the agreement.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In determining this issue, courts typically
    look to the specific terms of the contract as well as to the relationship between

    favour of perpetuity:  John D. McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, (Toronto: 
    Irwin Law, 2005) at 739 - 740.  Further, some types of contracts, including
    those of employment, partnership or personal services, which depend upon mutual
    trust between the contracting parties, naturally give rise to an implied right
    to terminate upon reasonable notice:  <i>Shaw</i>,  at paras. 23 and 29.</span></p>

    that the language of Article 20 was unequivocal and implicitly found that it
    created an agreement that was perpetual in nature.  For convenience, I repeat
    the relevant portion of Article 20:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This agreement will run from this
    date October 18, 2001 through December 31, 2002, predicated on both parties

    that the agreement will renew annually, it does not state that the agreement is
    perpetual.  A perpetual relationship, particularly in a business relationship
    such as the one that is the subject of the agreement, can involve significant
    commitments by both parties and has the potential for substantial long-term
    effects.  One might expect that an intent to be bound in this manner would be
    expressly stated. Moreover, on the literal reading of Article 20, either party
    could cause the agreement to terminate at renewal time by not fulfilling a
    provision in the agreement. That does not seem consistent with an intent to
    create a relationship in perpetuity.  In at least two cases courts have held
    that contracts with provisions worded similarly to Article 20 were not
    perpetual:  see </span><i><span style='line-height:200%'>Bernard—Norman

    trial judge that the language of Article 20 unequivocally points to a perpetual
    agreement.  I think the language of Article 20 calls for a close and full
    examination of the other factors the courts consider when deciding whether to
    construe a contract as being perpetual.  In this case, it was important that
    the trial judge have regard to the relationship of the parties and the
    surrounding circumstances.  Before turning to those matters, I will address two
    other provisions in the agreement. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Company [139] will provide all
    Food &amp; Beverage to the patrons of the teletheatre at no cost to the

    However, Article 6 suggests that Nordic has the right to take over “the
    complete facility” which appears to include providing food and beverage.  While
    it is not clear what would happen with respect to the balance of the agreement
    if Nordic chose to follow this course, Article 6 is an indication that the
    relationship created by the agreement may not be perpetual.</span></p>

    13 supports an interpretation that the agreement is perpetual.  The trial judge
    referred to Article 13 in her analysis.  However, it is not clear that she accepted
    139’s argument as to its interpretative value.  In any event, I do not accept
    that Article 13 adds much to the analysis one way or the other.  Unlike the
    termination provision in <i>Credit Security</i>, Article 13 does not say that
    the agreement may <u>only</u> be terminated in the circumstances set out. 
    Article 13 provides for termination in specific circumstances.  It does not
    address the issue of whether the contract should contain a provision for
    termination upon reasonable notice.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Implying

    relationship of the parties.  In her analysis, the trial judge considered only
    one feature of that relationship and she appears to have attached considerable
    weight to what she called the “unique nature of the relationship”.  She
    observed that if Nordic terminated the relationship, 139 could not replace or
    substitute Nordic with another OTB operator and that “there was no way [139]
    could mitigate its damages”.  As the trial judge explained, “[i]t was not a
    bargain that could be replaced, substituted, or mitigated when this breach
    occurred.”  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>While the fact that 139
    could not mitigate its damages in the case of termination may be a relevant
    factor to consider in determining if the agreement is perpetual, there were
    other facets of the relationship that the trial judge did not consider which
    pointed away from a finding that the parties intended to be bound to one another
    forever.  At the time they entered into the agreement, Nordic and 139 were
    virtual strangers.  They had never done business together and had no
    relationship of any kind.  Nordic was entering into an OTB agreement with 139 for
    the first time.  Ms. Raseta, 139’s principal, and her husband had operated
    restaurants in the Niagara region for many years;  however, they did not have
    any previous experience with an OTB operation.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    contemplates that the two parties would work together with 139 operating a food
    and beverage service and maintaining the premises, and Nordic running the OTB
    operation in the premises.  Thus, they would have to work together closely and
    co-operation would be important.  While the relationship created by the
    agreement was not one of employment, partnership or, strictly speaking, for
    personal services – which are the types of contracts into which courts
    routinely imply terms of termination on reasonable notice – it did involve many
    of the same components, such as the need for trust, confidence and
    satisfaction.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge also
    did not consider the surrounding circumstances to the agreement.  The origins
    of the agreement are important.  In 2000, Nordic learned that it could operate
    an OTB location in the Niagara region.  Initially, it sought to rent the
    premises at 444-446 Scott Street in St. Catharines from a company called York
    Bancroft Corporation (“York Bancroft”) with the idea of running the entire
    operation itself.  An offer to lease and a draft lease were prepared with a
    five-year term and two renewals, one for five years and a second for two
    years.  Nordic then learned that the Ontario Racing Commission did not permit
    it to hold a liquor licence off its own premises (the race track).  As a
    result, an arrangement was struck whereby York Bancroft would lease the
    premises to 139 (York Bancroft was owned by Ms. Raseta’s daughter-in-law and a
    partner).  A lease agreement was prepared, but not executed, under which 139 would
    lease the premises from York Bancroft for an initial five years with the same
    options for renewal as in the other draft lease.  139 entered into the
    agreement with Nordic.  139 agreed to operate the food and beverage service and
    to allow Nordic to operate its OTB operation on the premises.  Other than its interest
    arising from the unexecuted lease, 139 had no interest or rights to use the
    premises.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>These circumstances, in
    my view, point away from the agreement being perpetual in nature.  The premises
    were the key to the agreement.  Nordic needed a place to run its OTB
    operation.  When it sought to lease the premises, it contemplated doing so for
    a limited period of time, a five-year term with renewals up to a 12-year period
    in total.  Moreover, 139, at best, had a leasehold interest of limited
    duration.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, there are aspects of the surrounding circumstances which
    could point to a perpetual agreement. Most significantly, was the large cost
    incurred by 139 in order to install fixtures in the premises. In passing, the
    trial judge indicated that this amount was $117,700, but made no clear finding
    on the point. This sum of money could have taken 139 many years to recover.
    Thus, it may be argued that it would be unusual for 139 to agree to enter a contract
    that could be terminated on reasonable notice where such a significant initial
    investment was needed.  </p>

    may be true, as the trial judge found, that 139 would not have other OTB
    options if Nordic terminated the agreement, I am satisfied that the trial judge
    should have considered the other factors that I have mentioned in determining
    whether the agreement was perpetual or not.  Had the trial judge properly
    considered all of the relevant factors, she may very well have come to a
    different conclusion.</span></p>

    out below, I would order a new trial for purposes of calculating 139’s
    damages.  Given that I would order a new trial, I would also remit to that

    which the court should imply a term of reasonable notice for termination.</span></p>

    that period.  It had been operating for about one year when Nordic gave notice
    that the agreement would not be renewed.  Hence, the trial judge concluded that
    an 11-year damages period was appropriate.    </span></p>

    which was that she failed to deduct the cost of sales of beverages (including liquor)
    and food in calculating the loss of profits.  The evidence of the experts
    indicated that the cost of sales was between 29 and 50 per cent of revenues.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    released her judgment and reasons, counsel for Nordic moved to amend the
    decision under rule 59.06(1).  Nordic argued that the trial judge’s calculations
    were in error because she had failed to deduct the cost of sales.  In supplementary
    reasons released on February 27, 2009, the trial judge declined the invitation
    to reconsider the issue and indicated that her decision on damages “was based
    on a global assessment of all of the evidence and lack of evidence”.  She went
    on to say that she could not and would not parse out one or two items and
    change them because to do so would undermine the ratio of the whole
    decision.    </span></p>

    trial judge was confronted with a difficult task in assessing damages in this
    case.  However, her reasons explain how she came to the damages award and it is
    apparent that she did not account for the cost of sales.  Clearly, the cost of
    sales is an integral part of any loss of profits calculation.  Importantly, a
    deduction for the cost of sales could have a significant impact on the
    calculation of 139’s loss of profits.  In oral argument on appeal, 139’s
    counsel indicated that if 40 percent of revenues is used to calculate the cost
    of sales it would “decimate” the damages award.  Whatever the case, the failure
    to deduct the cost of sales could be significant.</span></p>

    judge miscalculated 139’s damages to its detriment. Specifically, 139 asserts

    by 139 as a result of having entered into the agreement.  </span>On appeal the
