style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alexander “Sandy” Wright, the appellant/respondent by
    cross-appeal, and Mary Wright, the respondent/appellant by cross-appeal,
    separated in May 2003 after a 27 year marriage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Over the course of the marriage, Sandy incorporated
    Aberfoyle Concrete Ltd. (“Aberfoyle”) and Washington Sand &amp; Gravel Ltd.
    (“WSGL”).  WSGL carries on the business
    of extracting and hauling gravel from a quarry while Aberfoyle manufactures and
    hauls ready-mix concrete for construction projects.  For ease of reference, the companies together
    will be referred to as the Wright Group.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sandy and Mary owned 51 per cent and 49 per cent of the
    shares in the Wright Group, respectively.  Both of them contributed to the businesses and were actively involved in
    their daily operations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A third business, Sandy Wright Trucking Ltd. (“SWTL”<span
class=GramE>),</span> is owned entirely by Sandy.  SWTL sells fuel to Aberfoyle and other
    customers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Their marriage fell apart on May 11, 2003 when Mary
    informed Sandy that she had become emotionally involved with William Demarte, a
    salesman for the Wright Group.  Mary
    immediately left her job and has not worked full-time since.  She moved in with Mr. Demarte in December
    2003 and they continue to live comfortably together in a country estate home
    valued at $575,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In late 2003, Sandy and Mary attempted to resolve their
    issues through the collaborative family law process.  As part of this process, the couple agreed to
    have the businesses valued as at May 31, 2003.  The valuation report, delivered on February 9, 2004, estimated that WSGL
    and Aberfoyle had fair market values of $301,000 and negative $21,000,
    respectively.  On this view, Mary
    Wright’s shares in the Wright Group were worth approximately $140,000 on May
    31, 2003. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Throughout most of the collaborative family law
    process, Sandy paid Mary a “salary” of $350/week, even though she no longer had
    any position with the Wright Group. When the collaborative family law process
    broke down in the spring of 2004, Sandy stopped making the weekly payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In June 2004, Sandy and Mary sold their matrimonial
    home, with the closing scheduled to take place on August 27, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later that same month, after the sale of the home, Mary
    (without counsel at this point) approached Sandy to discuss the issues they had
    been unable to resolve through counsel.  They came to an informal agreement, which Mary eventually wrote out on a
    note (the “Note”).  Mary told Sandy,
    “Give me this and we’re done.”  The Note
    reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Business</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>213,475.00</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>House &amp; Shop</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>254,050.00</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6 yrs @ 350.00</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>starting</span> Aug 01</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8 years @ 2647.87</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>life</span> insurance</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>tahoe</span></span> to be ret. Aug
    27 – payments to start August 01</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both parties understood that Sandy had to carry on the
    business, which required him to buy out Mary’s shares.  Accordingly, the first two lines of the Note
    – “Business 213,475.00” – reflect the value of Mary’s equity in Aberfoyle and
    WSGL based on an estimate prepared by the accountant for the Wright Group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sandy insisted that Mary have independent legal advice
    before signing anything and got his lawyer, Ms. Rinnie, to draft a formal
    separation agreement based on the Note.  Mary received the draft in July 2004 and retained Mr. Buck to advise
    her.  He reviewed the draft and told her
    not to sign it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the closing date for the sale of the matrimonial
    home approached, Sandy was advised by Ms. Rinnie not to provide the proceeds of
    sale to Mary unless she signed the draft separation agreement.  Sandy told Mary that he was concerned about
    her not signing the agreement.  He says
    that she replied, “You can trust me.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 25, 2004, three days before the closing date,
    Mr. Buck faxed a letter to Ms. Rinnie (the “August 25 Letter”), which referred
    to certain terms of the Note.  The August
    25 Letter reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am advised by my client that there have been discussions between <span
class=GramE>she</span> (sic) and her husband, and that the following has been
    agreed to:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>(a)</span> My client will receive on August
    27<sup>th</sup> instant with respect to the Nicholas Beaver property [the
    “Shop” referred to in the Note] the approximate sum of $173,000.00.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>(b)</span> <i>My client will be accepting of the content of paragraph 13 of the draft
    Separation Agreement </i>[which states that “[t]he parties agree that the wife
    will sell her shares in the respective companies back to the companies for a
    total of $213,475.00...”]<i> as the same
    relates to the share sale of the three companies</i>, however, there will need
    to be security which is satisfactory respecting the payments over time.  We are prepared to have discussions with you
    with respect to mortgage security or some other security which would be suitable.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>(c)</span> There will be no equalization of the
    parties’ RRSP’s contemplated as per paragraph 14 of the draft agreement, and
    each party will retain their respective RRSP’s.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>(d)</span> My client will return the Tahoe
    vehicle on Friday, however, there is to be no further or other expense
    respecting this vehicle to my client and any necessary expenses will be borne
    by your client. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Apparently, your
    client has advised Mrs. Wright that a letter from the writer setting out the
    foregoing is required in order that she receive the monies due to her with
    respect to the Nicholas Beaver property and the matrimonial home on August 27<sup>th</sup> instant. [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the lack of a formally signed
    separation agreement, both sides took concrete steps to implement a portion of the
    bargain set out in the Note and reflected in the August 25 Letter.  Toward the end of August 2004, Sandy mortgaged
    a property they jointly held (referred to as the “Shop” in the Note) to buy out
    Mary’s interest and paid Mary $243,500 for her half interest in the Shop and
    her share of the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home. Sandy also
    resumed the weekly payments to Mary that he had stopped when the collaborative
    family law process broke down, but reduced the amount to $300/week.  These payments continued up until the end of
    October 2005.  For her part, Mary gave
    Sandy the Tahoe vehicle and conveyed her interest in the Shop to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On September 20, 2004, Mr. Buck asked for certain
    changes to the draft agreement, including an increase in spousal support to
    $2,588/month in addition to “salary” payments of $350/week for eight years.
    Sandy rejected these changes, and although negotiations continued over the next
    several months, the parties were unable to resolve the support issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, on February 23, 2006, Sandy initiated
    proceedings for divorce, equalization and an order requiring that Mary transfer
    her shares in the Wright Group to him.  Counsel agreed that the Wright Group would pay Mary $2,647.87/month on
    an interim basis, without prejudice, to be allocated by the trial judge either
    on account of share value or as spousal support.  In total, Sandy made 15 such payments
    totalling $39,718.05.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge granted Sandy and Mary a divorce.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge viewed the August 25 Letter, which
    essentially reiterated the terms of the Note, as either (i) a counter-offer
    from Mary to Sandy in response to Sandy’s offer outlined in the draft agreement
    prepared by Ms. Rinnie; or (ii) a free-standing offer in its own right.  Under either scenario, the trial judge
    reasoned, the August 25 Letter offered Sandy a partial resolution of the
    outstanding issues on the following terms:  Mary agreed to accept $213,475 as the value of her equity in the Wright
    Group, transfer her interest in the Shop and return the Tahoe vehicle in exchange
    for the immediate receipt of her share of the proceeds from the sale of the
    matrimonial home and the value of her half interest in the Shop, and no
    equalization of RRSPs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found Sandy’s conduct – that is, the payment
    of $243,500 to Mary for the transfer of her title in the Shop and her share of
    the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home – was an acceptance of
    Mary’s offer.  The trial judge held that
    there was a mutuality of promises constituting consideration and that both parties
    acted to their detriment in fulfilling the agreement.  Once the resulting agreement was executed,
    the trial judge concluded that “[t]here was no going back” and that it would be
    unconscionable for either Sandy or Mary to repudiate the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately, the trial judge concluded that the offer in
    the August 25 Letter was accepted because both parties acted on it.  He ordered that the 15 payments of $2,647.87
    already made by Sandy be deducted from the $213,475 he owes Mary for her
    shares. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only remaining issues to be resolved, in the trial
    judge’s view, were spousal support (addressed in the Note, but not the August
    25 Letter) and the question of security for Sandy’s purchase of Mary’s shares.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to spousal support, the trial judge observed
    that Mary failed to show need and now enjoys a much more luxurious lifestyle
    than when she was married.  The trial
    judge noted that “[o]ne may guess how [Mary] maintains that lifestyle but she
    has clearly concealed from the court the means by which she manages to support
    her current lifestyle and alleged debt load.”  In determining a final amount for support, the trial judge considered: (i)
    Mary’s significant contribution to the marriage and the Wright Group; (ii) the
    speculative economic disadvantages to her arising from the breakdown of the
    marriage; (iii) that Sandy should not be saddled with the obligation to
    maintain Mary’s higher post-separation standard of living with Mr. Demarte; and
    (iv) that Sandy must have the means to pay for the support.  After a detailed analysis, the trial judge
    arrived at the amount of $800/month commencing September 1, 2008 (i.e. not
    retroactive).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The question of costs was argued separately before the
    trial judge on October 17, 2008.  The
    trial judge concluded that, considering Sandy’s financial circumstances, Mary’s
    revised September 20, 2004 draft was “not merely unreasonable; it was
    outrageous.”  The trial judge found
    Mary’s actions during the negotiation process tantamount to reneging on the
    agreement to fix the share value, which forced the trial to confront a wholly
    unnecessary evaluation and revaluation of the Wright Group.  For these reasons, he awarded Sandy costs on
    a substantial indemnity basis. </p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)       The
    valuation of the Wright Group’s shares</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of the valuation of the Wright Group
    shares, the trial judge fixed the value of Mary’s 49 per cent at $213,475 – the
    amount reflected in the Note, Sandy’s first draft agreement prepared by Ms.
    Rinnie and the August 25 Letter sent by Mary’s counsel.  Sandy argues that the trial judge erred in at
    least two respects.  First, the trial
    judge purported to find that an agreement as to the value of the shares had
    been reached by the parties in 2004 and that “[o]nce a contract is executed, it
    cannot be repudiated.”  This, Sandy
    submits, is an error in law, since if one party accepts the other party’s
    repudiation, the contract is in fact at an end.  Sandy argues that this is precisely what occurred in this case.  Second, Sandy submits that, at trial, the
    issue framed by the parties for determination by the judge was the value of the
    shares as of August 2007 for purposes of a compelled transfer from the
    respondent to the appellant pursuant to the <i>Ontario
    Business Corporations Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (the “OBCA”).  As a result, it was not open to the trial
    judge to use a 2004 value for the shares in the net family property
    equalization calculations, or to find that there was a valid contract in
    respect of the value/transfer of the shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject these submissions for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge’s reasons are, at times,
    unclear, I accept Mary’s submission that, in effect, the trial judge found,
    through a combination of the August 25 Letter and their subsequent actions,
    that the parties had reached a binding agreement in 2004 valuing the Mary’s
    shares in the Wright Group at $213,475 for transfer to Sandy. It was only as a
    result of the parties’ failure to reach an agreement on other issues that Mary refused
    to <span class=GramE>effect</span> the transfer.  Having found that an agreement concerning the
    shares was reached in 2004, the trial judge – although referencing the net
    family property equalization calculations – ultimately granted the appropriate
    remedies.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The repudiation issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with Sandy’s submission that the trial
    judge erred in his treatment of the repudiation issue.  Standing alone, the trial judge’s statement
    that “once a contract is executed it cannot be repudiated” is misleading;
    however, when it is read in the context of the whole decision, it is apparent
    that the trial judge was not suggesting that a contract can never be
    repudiated, but rather that one party cannot unilaterally repudiate a contract
    once it has been partly performed unless repudiation is accepted by the other
    party.  This is apparent from comments
    made by the trial judge later in his reasons where he notes that Sandy believed
    Mary “was attempting to repudiate her agreement” but that neither Sandy nor his
    lawyer “ever expressly stated that Sandy accepted Mary’s repudiation of the
    share value agreement.”  The trial judge
    concludes, “I do not think <u>either</u> had the right to repudiate that
    agreement” (emphasis added).  In other
    words, there was never clear acceptance of the repudiation by the
    non-repudiating party of the 2004 agreement concerning the shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before trial, Mary had tried to repudiate the agreement
    to transfer the shares and had maintained that the shares were worth
    substantially more than had been agreed in 2004.  Her position in final submissions at trial,
    however, was that Sandy should be held to the 2004 agreement on the value of
    the shares as he had effectively operated the company as his own since 2004.  I agree.  The way Sandy administered the companies from 2004 onward supports the
    trial judge’s finding that the 2004 agreement concerning the shares was binding.   He conducted himself as full owner of Mary’s
    shares. Although Mary remained as a director and officer of the Wright Group
    after her employment ended in 2003, starting in 2004 she was essentially cut
    off from banking and other documentation relating to the companies.  Indeed, from that point on, Sandy operated
    the companies as his own and, with the exception of receiving the occasional
    salary payments, Mary had no involvement whatsoever in the business. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge
    to reject Sandy’s submission that there had been a repudiation of the
    agreement.  Although repudiation may have
    been sought by both parties at various times, the record discloses no clear
    acceptance by one party of the repudiation by the other.  The record at trial supports a finding that
    the parties conducted themselves as if the shares had effectively been
    transferred to Sandy in 2004. </p>
  <h4><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span><span lang=EN-US>2007 share value vs. 2004
    share value </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sandy takes the position that, by the time of trial,
    there was a consensus between the parties that the 2007 value of the shares
    should be used.  He argues that a much
    lower August 2007 valuation was appropriate.  Mary argues for either a much higher value or the agreed upon 2004
    value.  Further, Sandy submits that the
    trial judge confused the family law net family property issues with the OBCA<i> </i>issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The
    share valuation issues did, in part, raise net family property equalization
    issues because one of the corporations, SWTL, was owned solely by Sandy on the
    valuation date and would therefore have to be valued at that date and
    incorporated into the net family property equalization calculations.  The trial judge’s conclusion that it was
    equitable to hold the parties to the 2004 agreement and assign the agreed upon value
    to the shares addressed both the issue of an equalization payment under the FLA
    and the OBCA issues arising from the transfer of shares from Sandy to
    Mary.  While these issues are
    conceptually distinct and ought to properly be addressed separately, as a
    practical matter both issues arose from the marriage breakdown and the payment
    ordered by the trial judge can be viewed as finally settling the net family
    property equalization and OBCA issues.  This
    is consistent with the language used in the trial judge’s order, which requires
    Mary to transfer her shares to Sandy for $213,475 and immediately thereafter
    states, “No further equalization is required.”  I do not find serious fault in this approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although much of the trial focused on the 2007 value of
    the Wright Group’s shares, this issue was only relevant if the trial judge had
    concluded that no agreement had been reached in 2004 as to the share value, or
    that the agreement reached in 2004 had subsequently been repudiated.  Once the trial judge found that the parties
    had reached a binding agreement on the share issue in 2004, he did not have to
    value the shares for the purposes of a compelled transfer under the OBCA.  Instead, he could simply use the agreed upon
    value to dispose of that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s approach was consistent with the
    parties’ pleadings.  Sandy’s application,
    as well as Mary’s answer, both sought the equalization of net family
    properties.  In addition, Sandy’s pleading
    states that he made a substantial payment to Mary in reliance on the 2004
    settlement, referring to the $243,500 he paid Mary for her interest in the Shop
    and her portion of the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar support for the trial judge’s conclusion on the
    valuation issue can be found in the parties’ final written submissions at
    trial.  Sandy appended his net family
    property statement showing that he owned 100 per cent of the shares.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  In her final submissions, Mary confirmed that
    ordering an equalization payment was an option, that the net family property
    statement could be used to give a total picture of the obligations the parties
    owed to each other, and that the agreed upon 2004 share value should be used.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using the 2004 share value also obviated the need to
    have Sandy account for the Wright Group’s operations for the 2004 to 2007
    period when he had effectively operated the businesses as his own.  Sandy’s expert explained that because the
    companies’ principal asset – a gravel pit – was being rapidly depleted, the
    value of the Wright Group’s land had declined substantially since 2004.  During that same period, Sandy’s salary from
    the Wright Group had increased substantially.  Absent such an accounting, therefore, it may well have been unfair to
    Mary to have used the 2007 value. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the trial judge’s decision simply
    implements the parties’ 2004 agreement.  He ordered that title to the shares owned by Mary be transferred to
    Sandy and that payment to Mary of the agreed upon amount be made.  On the specific facts of this case, it was,
    in my view, open to him to proceed in this manner and I would not interfere.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)       The quantum and duration of spousal support
    awarded</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sandy submits that the trial judge erred in awarding
    Mary indefinite spousal support in the amount of $800/month despite his
    findings that she is an intelligent and resourceful woman who has done little
    to promote her economic self-sufficiency and now enjoys a more luxurious
    lifestyle with Mr. Demarte.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary submits that support payments compensate a spouse
    upon the breakdown of a marriage for contributions made to the marriage.  Mary argues her ability to earn has been
    reduced because she did not pursue her education or career as a direct result
    of her marriage to Sandy and the raising of their children.  She submits that her failure to achieve
    economic self-sufficiency is only one of many factors to be considered.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find no such basis for interfering with the quantum

    discussed above, support orders made by trial judges are entitled to deference

    is no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s conclusions on the issue of

    reasons reflect an appreciation of the circumstances and a careful
    consideration of the relevant factors.  Summarizing his analysis, the trial judge wrote:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mary
    received an acceptable sum of spousal support during and for some time after
    the collaborative law process.  Thereafter, she chose not to make any application for interim spousal
    support.  The $2,647.87 she was recently
    receiving was without prejudice.  I have
    allocated it to share acquisition.  It
    seems likely that she spent that sum even though it was partly capital, as she
    did with her RRSPs.  However, the
    evidence is clear that she lacked for nothing and she failed to disclose how
    she maintained her current lifestyle.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge’s conclusion in this regard was amply supported by his findings of
    fact, including his finding that Mary failed to show need; made a conscious choice
    to take a break from her former regimen of continuous hard work; did little to
    promote her economic self-sufficiency; chose to, in effect, take a period of
    retirement and live off her capital and the generosity of her parents; enjoyed
    a very comfortable lifestyle with Mr. Demarte; and concealed from the court the
    means by which she manages to support that lifestyle. The trial judge also
    correctly took into account Sandy’s ability to pay, given his financial
    situation and the balance of the order being made.</span></p>

    trial judges have the ability to award costs against a “successful party who

    this case, the trial judge gave ample reasons for his costs award.  The trial judge found that Mary’s settlement
    proposals were “outrageous” and constituted “a completely impossible demand for
    spousal support.”  Furthermore, the trial
    judge found that Mary did not “win” her claim for the transfer of shares or for
    spousal support, but rather had continuously made settlement impossible by
    making demands that she knew could never be met.  In effect, the trial judge concluded that the
    matter would have settled years ago had Mary not sought to obtain much more
    than what had been agreed to between the parties in 2004.</span></p>
