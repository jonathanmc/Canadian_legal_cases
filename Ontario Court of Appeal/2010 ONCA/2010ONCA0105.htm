    acquitted after his trial by judge alone of eight counts of robbery with a

    respondent’s whereabouts were unknown.  This court made orders dated May 25,
    2007 and May 9, 2008 permitting substituted service on him.  On September 3,
    2008, the court appointed Mr. Ian R. Smith <i>amicus curiae</i> to respond to
    the appeal.  On September 24, 2009 the respondent was personally served with a
    letter from Crown counsel informing him of the Crown’s appeal, the appointment
    of <i>amicus curiae</i>, and the time and place of the hearing of the appeal. 
    He has not responded in any way.</span></p>

    a series of attacks on sex-trade workers in Toronto and Mississauga between
    February 27, 2004 and April 9, 2004.  The only live issue at trial was the
    identity of the assailant.  Other than the identification evidence of three of
    the eight victims there was no evidence connecting the respondent to any of the
    offences.  The trial judge found that the identification evidence was fraught
    with frailties and concluded that the Crown had failed to prove the
    respondent’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on each charge.</span></p>

    Code, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (“Criminal Code”) is limited to questions of law
    alone.  I would dismiss this appeal because the Crown, in essence, seeks to
    have this court consider the reasonableness of the trial judge’s verdict. </span></p>

    reviewed and analyzed the evidence and stated the principles of law he was
    applying.  None of his findings of fact and credibility can be disturbed absent
    an error of law alone.   It is necessary to review only enough of the factual
    background to explain why this court is without jurisdiction to entertain the
    Crown’s appeal.  In my review of the factual background I include relevant
    excerpts of the trial judge’s findings and reasoning.  </span></p>

    involving eight victims.  In each incident, the assailant set up an appointment
    to meet a sex-trade worker in the apartment or hotel where she worked.  The
    assailant either wore a mask, or on entering, acted quickly to wear a mask,
    giving his victim little time and opportunity to see his face. </span></p>

    investigators consulted with Corrections Canada.  The assailant had told one of
    the victims that he had recently been released from penitentiary.  The victim
    had smoked crack cocaine with him.  Investigators asked Corrections Canada for
    the identities of large black men, known to smoke crack cocaine, who had
    recently been released from penitentiary.  Corrections Canada provided the
    respondent’s name.  He was charged when three of the eight victims, H.S., M.V.
    and T.D., picked him out of photo lineups.  </span></p>

    he granted the Crown’s application to have the evidence relating to each of
    these three victims admitted as similar fact evidence capable of proving the
    identity of the assailant in all of the other counts.   In the second ruling, he
    refused to allow the Crown to introduce, as post-offence conduct, evidence that
    Mr. Powell had turned in a gun to the police.</span></p>

    trial judge found Mr. Powell to be the assailant of at least one of the three
    victims who testified at trial purporting to identify him, he had to acquit him
    of all charges.  After reciting this concession, the trial judge reviewed and
    analyzed the evidence of each of the three victims and then indicated he had also
    considered the evidence cumulatively. </span></p>

    man who booked an appointment.  When the man arrived, H.S. briefly looked
    through the peephole to see a black man with his face turned sideways.  After
    opening the door, H.S. again briefly looked at the man.  She noted his hair was braided into small braids close to his
    head.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After walking in, the man bolted for the
    bathroom.  When he came out he was wearing a mask that covered his face from
    the cheekbones down and he was carrying a gun.  He shut off every light in the
    apartment and kept the mask on until he left the apartment.  The assailant then

    was a crack cocaine addict.  In an apparent attempt to gain his confidence,
    H.S. smoked crack cocaine with him.  The assailant then sexually assaulted
    her.  H.S. recalled the assailant telling her that he had just finished doing
    “seven years in the pen”.    After the sexual assault, the assailant put her on
    the bed and told her to wait half an hour, during which he rummaged through the

    observed at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Parliament has thus conferred
    jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal against a conviction on
    three separate grounds, one of which is the very ground upon which the Court of

    the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”. The
    fact that s. 592(1)(a) recognizes this ground as being separate and distinct
    from “the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law” appears to me to be
    the best kind of evidence of the fact that Parliament did not intend the phrase
    “a question of law” as it is used in the Code to include the question of
    whether the verdict at trial was unreasonable or could not be supported by the
    evidence. <i>It is noteworthy that having accorded the Court of Appeal
    jurisdiction to hear appeals against conviction on the ground that the verdict

    provide the Crown a right of appeal from an unreasonable acquittal.  Richie J.
    went on to hold that the Court of Appeal in <i>Sunbeam</i> had “exceeded its
    jurisdiction by allowing this appeal on a ground reserved for appeals against
    conviction which does not extend to appeals by the Attorney General”.</span></p>

    relate principally to the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence before him. 
    In fact, the fourth ground, that the trial judge’s misapprehension of the
    evidence rises to the level of palpable and overriding error, is phrased as an
    attack on unreasonable factual findings.  Indeed, the Crown expressly conceded
    it took no issue with the principles of law that the trial judge set out in his
    reasons and said he was applying.  Clearly then, the Crown’s appeal must be
    examined to ensure that it raises grounds that may be properly characterized as

    earlier decisions including<i> Sunbeam</i> cited above, but also because it
    deals with the argument that there must be a factual foundation for a trial
    judge’s finding that reasonable doubt exists.  That argument that there must be
    some factual foundation for a trial judge’s finding that reasonable doubt
    exists, relies on the established proposition that it is an error of law to

    Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal: <i>R. v. Schuldt, </i>23
    Man. R. (2d) 75.  The majority’s decision was based on the view that the

    Court of Appeal and restored the acquittal.  Lamer J. (as he then was) wrote
    for the unanimous Court.  He began by expressing his concerns about the
    principle of double jeopardy embodied in s. 11(h) of the <i>Charter</i>, noting
    the carefully circumscribed parameters for allowing a Crown appeal from an

lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lamer J. then turned to the argument that there
    was no factual foundation on which the trial judge could have properly based a
    finding of reasonable doubt.  He recognized the general proposition that the
    total absence of a foundation for a finding of fact is an error of law, but
    pointed out there remained the question as to the circumstances under which a
    finding could properly be made that there is a total absence of evidence.  It
    is unnecessary to review his careful exposition of the earlier cases upon which
    the Crown relied.  Suffice it to say that he concluded that the proposition
    that the total absence of a foundation for a finding of fact is an error of law
    generally has no application to a trial judge’s conclusion that there is
    reasonable doubt.  As the accused does not have to prove the existence of
    reasonable doubt, no particular evidence to support the finding of reasonable
    doubt is necessary and the proposition does not apply.  </span></p>

    circumstance where an evidentiary basis is required to acquit.  That is where
    the law provides for a presumption and places a burden on the accused to
    displace it.  In such a case, it is an error of law to acquit in the face of
    the presumption.  The trial judge commits an error of law by finding reasonable
    doubt in the absence of any evidence to support the displacement of the
    presumption.    His conclusion at para. 39 is clear and succinct:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In other words, absent a shifting
    of the burden of proof upon the accused there is always some evidence upon
    which to make a finding of fact favourable to the accused, and such a finding,

    pointed out that Cartwright C.J. had said essentially the same thing earlier in <i>Lampard v. The Queen</i>, [1969] S.C.R.  373, at p. 381:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In a criminal case (except in the

    Ritchie J. had made in <i>Sunbeam</i>.  Ritchie J., on his review of the
    jurisprudence had found there was no authority “for the proposition that in an
    appeal against a judgment of acquittal under … the Criminal Code ‘a question of
    law alone’ is involved whenever a reviewing court is of opinion that the
    finding of the trial judge was unreasonable and improper having regard to the
    evidence”.  In <i>Sunbeam, </i>Ritchie J. had gone on to express his concern
    that if the phrase “a question of law alone” were construed in that way, it
    would enlarge the meaning of the phrase “a question of law” as it occurs in
    other sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and that such an interpretation
    would “broaden the scope of appellate jurisdiction under the Criminal Code

    both occasions.  Counsel for the Crown submitted that standing by itself, this
    evidence was capable of proving identity, particularly in the context of all

    that he could speak with both a Jamaican and a “white” accent, that he had
    bulging eyes and that he had large hands and long thumbs.  The third pillar of

    insufficient evidence, for the trial judge to find there was reasonable doubt. 
    This is precisely the argument that the Supreme Court rejected in <i>Schuldt</i> and <i>Sunbeam.</i>  The Crown’s corollary argument that the evidence was so
    probative that it had to result in conviction is simply a different phrasing of
    the argument that there was no evidence to support a finding of reasonable
    doubt.  </span></p>

    identified amounts to little more than an attempt to persuade this court to
    take a different view of the evidentiary record than the trial judge.  Crown
    counsel went so far as to invite this court to make its own assessment of the
    evidence, submitting that this court’s visual examination of the photographic
    and video exhibits would persuade it that Mr. Powell’s large hands and long
    thumbs uniquely matched the description of the assailant’s hands and thumbs.</span></p>

    identification evidence and weighing it against evidence that might undermine
    it is within the fact-finding province of the trial judge.  Moreover, similar
    fact evidence is circumstantial evidence and the weight to be attributed to it
    is also a question for the trier of fact.  As Cory J.A. said in <i>R. v. Arp, </i>[1998]
    3 S.C.R. 339 at para. 72:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Similar fact evidence, on the
    other hand, as circumstantial evidence, must be characterized differently,
    since, by its nature, it does not carry the potential to be conclusive of
    guilt.  It is just one item of evidence to be considered as part of the Crown’s
    overall case.  Its probative value lies in its ability to support, through the
    improbability of coincidence, other inculpatory evidence.  <i>As with all
    circumstantial evidence, the jury will decide what weight to attribute to it.</i> 
    The mere fact that in a particular case, similar fact evidence might be
    assigned a high degree of weight by the trier is entirely different from the
    concept that, by its nature, the evidence has the potential to be decisive of
    guilt. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    improbability of coincidence that arises from similar fact evidence is an error
    of fact.  No amount of gerrymandering can elevate the weight the trier of fact
    attributes to similar fact evidence to a question of law alone.  I conclude
    that the trial judge’s finding of reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence
    does not involve a question of law alone.    </span></p>

    extraordinary improbability of coincidence that arose from it.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submitted that in evaluating the
    similar act evidence relating to identity the trial judge improperly used the
    “anchor” approach that was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Arp</i> in favour of the “pooling” or “cumulative” approach.  Cory J. explained the “anchor”
    approach at para. 60 of <i>Arp</i>.  The “anchor” analysis requires that the
    trier of fact first find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed
    one of the allegedly similar offences using only the evidence relevant to that
    offense, before considering the circumstances of that offense as similar fact
    evidence with regard to the remaining counts.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By contrast, in the “pooling” approach the trier
    of fact must first conclude on a balance of probabilities that the allegedly
    similar acts were committed by the same person.  This preliminary determination
    is made without considering evidence of the accused’s involvement in each act. 
    Once it is concluded the allegedly similar acts were committed by the same
    person and there is evidence linking the accused to the acts, the trier of fact
    may consider all the evidence related to the alleged similar acts in
    determining the accused’s guilt for any one act. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The point of departure of the Crown’s argument
    that the trial judge used the “anchor” approach is his remark near the outset
    of his reasons that the Crown concedes “that if I am unable to find that the
    Crown has proven that Mr. Powell was the assailant of at least one of the three
    victims who purport to identify him, T.D., M.V., or H.S., then I must acquit Mr.
    Powell of all the charges”.  The Crown on appeal argues that this comment shows
    that the trial judge proceeded on the basis that it was necessary that he find
    the respondent guilty of one of the counts beyond a reasonable doubt before
    considering the similar fact evidence.  However, reading this comment in
    context, it is clear that the trial judge dealt with the similar fact evidence
    precisely in accordance with the approach set out in the Supreme Court’s
    decision in <i>Arp</i>.  Further, despite the Crown’s attempt on appeal to
    explain away the position it took at trial, the concession indicated by the
    trial judge was made unequivocally and without reservations.</span></p>

    evidence, the trial judge indicated that in assessing the similarity of the
    acts, he should first only consider the manner in which the acts were committed
    and not the evidence as to the accused’s involvement in each act.  His analysis
    makes it evident that he did so.  </span></p>

    its force from the objective improbability of coincidence.  He said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In assessing the probative value
    of the similar fact evidence with respect to identity one must keep in mind
    that similar fact evidence is admitted “on the basis of an objective improbability
    of coincidence.”  In other words, are the similarities so marked that the
    possibility of their being the product of coincidence is objectively
    improbable?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In support of its application the Crown had
    submitted a Chart of Similarities.  The Chart indicated that in all six attacks
    the assailant was a “black man” with a “large build.”  The other 22
    similarities set out in the Chart related to the manner in which the offences
    were committed.  The defence countered with dissimilarities in how the offences
    were committed and in the descriptions the victims provided of the assailant. 
    The defence pointed out that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The assailant’s height was
    described variously as being 5 feet 4 inches, somewhere from 5 feet 10 inches
    to 6 feet, to 6 feet 4 inches.  Similarly, estimates of the assailant’s weight
    varied from 175 pounds, 200 pounds, to between 200 and 250 pounds, to 280 to
    285 pounds, to 300 to 350 pounds.  Similarly, descriptions of the assailant’s
    skin tone varied in terms of how dark he was.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not view these discrepancies
    surprising and did not consider them fatal to the Crown’s application.  He
    observed that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The reliability of the victims’
    observations is understandably undermined by the fact that they are attempting
    to describe what they saw at a highly stressful time when they were being
    threatened with a gun.  Indeed, the conflicting descriptions given by [the two
    pairs of witnesses who observed the assailant at the same time] demonstrate
    that some or all of them are mistaken about what they claim to see.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Therefore, he did not attach “great significance
    to the differences with respect to the descriptions of the assailant, his
    clothing, footwear and the mask involved”.  On the other hand he recognized
    that “the description of the assailant as a right-handed, large, black man is
    so generic that it could apply to many men in the Greater Toronto Area”.  The
    trial judge emphasized as pivotal the similarity that calls from the same cell
    phone connected the assailant to each of the incidents.  He concluded that it
    was likely that all the acts were committed by the same person.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also indicated that in order to
    make the similar act evidence admissible there had to be some evidence linking
    the respondent to the set of similar acts.  Quoting Cory J. at para. 54 of <i>Arp</i>,
    he stated that the link did not have to be proved and it was necessary only
    that there be “some evidence upon which the trier of fact can make a proper
    finding that the similar facts to be relied upon were in fact the acts of the
    accused”.  The trial judge found that the requirement of the link was met in
    this case “by the fact that T.D., M.V., and H.S. all purport to identify Mr.
    Powell as their assailant”.  This satisfied him that there was “‘some evidence’
    linking Mr. Powell to the counts on the indictment that the Crown [sought] to
    use as similar fact evidence”.  After concluding that the probative value of
    the similar act evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect the trial judge
    admitted it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then, at the outset of his reasons for judgment,
    the trial judge included a reminder that he had ruled that the Crown could rely
    on the evidence of the offences involving three of the eight victims who
    purported to identify the respondent as similar fact evidence capable of proving
    the identity of the assailant in all of the other counts.  In his reasons for
    judgment the trial judge again stated that he considered all of the offences to
    be strikingly similar and that he was satisfied they were likely committed by
    the same person.  The trial judge’s summary of the case for the Crown makes
    clear that he recognized the Crown relied on the coupling of the evidence of
    H.S. with that of M.V. and T.D. to prove that that Mr. Powell was the assailant
    in all the offences charged.  Following his careful review of the evidence of
    H.S., M.V. and T.D., the trial judge stated that while he had discussed their
    evidence in turn, he had also assessed their evidence as part of his cumulative
    assessment of the evidence as a whole.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown advanced its attack on the trial
    judge’s approach to similar fact evidence focusing on his treatment of the
    testimony of T.D., M.V., and H.S.  The testimony of these eyewitnesses
    purporting to identify the accused in this case had not been admitted as circumstantial
    similar fact evidence.  Their testimony was direct evidence of identity.  No
    doubt the similar fact evidence was important to the Crown’s overall case. 
    However, this particular Crown argument does not rely on the similarity in the </span><i>manner
    in which the different offences were committed</i><span lang=EN-US> to prove
    the respondent’s identity as the assailant based on the improbability of
    coincidence.  Rather, the Crown relies on the improbability that three of the
    eight victims would all be mistaken in offering direct testimony identifying
    the same person as the assailant.  This is a different kind of improbability of
    coincidence than considered in <i>Arp.</i> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted, the trial judge was amply satisfied by
    the improbability of coincidence that the identity of the assailant was the same
    in all six attacks.  It was still necessary to link Mr. Powell to the set of
    attacks beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge concluded that the direct evidence
    of H.S., M.V. and T.D., even considered cumulatively, did not establish that
    link beyond a reasonable doubt.  He said: “While the evidence of T.D., M.V., and
    H.S. was sufficient to satisfy a link to Mr. Powell for the purposes of the
    similar fact application, it is not remotely adequate to prove that Mr. Powell
    committed any of these offences”.  There was no other evidence linking Mr.
    Powell to the offences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The coincidental identification of Mr. Powell by
    three of the eight victims is potentially highly probative evidence.  However,
    there is no principle of law that direct identification evidence, including the
    coincidental identification evidence of three witnesses, must be found to be
    credible and reliable enough to warrant conviction.  It was for the trial judge
    to assess the credibility, reliability and weight to be attached to the direct
    evidence of the three eyewitnesses who each identified Mr. Powell as the
    assailant.  If he made an error in that regard and mistakenly concluded there
    was a reasonable doubt in the face of such evidence it is an error of fact.  This
    court has no jurisdiction to consider whether the trial judge in fact so erred. </span></p>
