  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants allege that there were several errors in the jury charge
    relating to the concepts of negligence and proximate cause, and the onus on Mr.
    Gordon in the face of a clear statutory breach – being on the wrong side of the
    road at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, when the charge is read fairly as a whole, we are satisfied
    that the jury would have understood that the onus was on Mr. Gordon to explain
    how the accident could have occurred without his negligence. The jury was
    invited to consider all of the indicia of negligence that the appellants
    advanced, including Mr. Gordon’s speed, lack of attention, knowledge that the
    intersection in question was dangerous, and knowledge of his vehicle’s braking
    system, especially on a wet road. The question put to the jury, as agreed to by
    counsel, was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Has the defendant Gordon satisfied you on the whole
    of the evidence that the accident in question did not occur through any
    negligence on his part?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury responded in the affirmative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By answering the question as they did, it is apparent that the jury was
    satisfied that Mr. Gordon had met his onus of establishing, on balance, that
    there was an emergency situation that he had not created or contributed to and
    that he exercised the care that an ordinary, prudent person would have exercised
    in the same circumstances. The issue for the jury was not whether a better course
    of action may have been open to Mr. Gordon but whether what he did was what an
    ordinary prudent person might reasonably have been expected to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellants take serious issue with the trial judge’s charge on
    proximity, it was essential that the jury understand that Mr. Gordon’s breach
    of one or more statutory provisions cannot impose absolute liability.  The
    trial judge’s charge effectively conveyed that message. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, we are not persuaded that the alleged errors in the jury
    charge warrant a new trial. In so concluding, we have not ignored this court’s
    decision in <i>Senger v. Lachman</i>, 2008 ONCA 323. In that case, unlike the
    present case, the court was not addressing an explanation that arose out of an
    emergency situation; rather, it was considering acts of alleged negligence that
    occurred before an emergency arose. Moreover, in this case, unlike in <i>Senger</i>,
    after the initial charge, the appellants made several objections and the trial
    judge brought back the jury and provided correcting instructions for most of
    them. Importantly, he made it crystal clear that Mr. Gordon bore the onus of
    explaining how the accident could have occurred without his negligence. After
    the recharge, counsel were invited to make further comment and had none. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the appeal to the respondent fixed at $20,000 plus
    disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
