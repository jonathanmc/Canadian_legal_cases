  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the appellants, duty counsel argues that the trial judge’s jury
    instruction on the requisite elements of conspiracy was flawed, or at least
    confusing.  In particular, he submits that at least two parts of the trial
    judge’s instruction can be read as suggesting to the jury that it was to
    consider the purpose of the alleged conspiracy only after first determining
    whether the appellants were members of the conspiracy and, further, that it was
    open to the jury to use the hearsay evidence of the statements of the
    appellants’ co-conspirators when considering whether the appellants were
    members of the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the trial judge erred in the manner alleged.  At
    several places throughout her charge, she clearly told the jury, in the correct
    sequence, of the elements that the Crown was obliged to prove to establish the
    conspiracy alleged.  If there was any confusion about this, it was removed by
    the decision tree provided to the jury concerning conspiracy, which unambiguously
    detailed the necessary elements of the offence and the proper sequence for the
    jury’s consideration of those elements.  Given the charge as a whole, we are satisfied
    that the jury would have appreciated its task.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duty counsel next argues that several counts in the indictment, for
    example, count 19, were deficient because they failed to explicitly invoke s.
    465(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  We disagree.  Section 465(3) does not
    create an offence.  The counts in question clearly charged a breach of foreign
    law and made explicit reference to the operative offence provision of the <i>Code</i> – s. 465(1)(c): see <i>R. v. Gunn</i> (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 294 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ third complaint concerns the attendance of an RCMP
    officer in the jury room to assist in resolving technical equipment problems. 
    At its core, this complaint raises an issue of trial fairness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, we see no merit to this complaint.  The officer’s
    attendance was at the trial judge’s request.  When the trial judge learned that
    the jury had been present when the officer was in the jury room, she
    immediately arranged for an inquiry of the officer to be conducted, under oath,
    regarding what had transpired in the jury room.  The officer’s testimony
    established that no impropriety had occurred.  Neither defence counsel
    cross-examined the officer or expressed any concern or objection.  There is
    simply no basis to conclude that anything untoward transpired with the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as to sentence, the appellants complain that the trial judge
    failed to give credit for time they spent in immigration hold after being
    released on bail for these offences.  We reject this submission.  Credit for
    pre-trial custody is discretionary.  It was open to the trial judge in the
    circumstances to decline to give credit for the time spent in immigration
    detention particularly since it was the appellants’ own lack of immigration
    status in Canada, and not the circumstances relating to these charges, that
    underpinned the immigration detention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction appeals are dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is
    granted and the sentence appeals are dismissed.</p>
