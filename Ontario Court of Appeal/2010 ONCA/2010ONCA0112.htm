  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence of 12 years’
    imprisonment following his conviction on four counts of robbery using a
    firearm. The charges related to a series of home invasion robberies carried out
    by a gang and organized by the appellant in the Hamilton and Brampton areas. As
    the charges related to offences committed in different districts, some
    proceeded in Hamilton and others – those at issue in this appeal – proceeded in
    Brampton. The appellant attempted to have all the charges dealt with together
    but was unable to do so as crown counsel were unable to coordinate their
    involvement to make that happen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Hamilton proceedings, the appellant was convicted of conspiracy
    and assault with intent to steal and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment on the
    conspiracy charge and 10 years concurrent on the assault with intent to steal
    charges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was then convicted and sentenced on the charges now before
    this court. The trial judge expressly made the twelve year sentence, imposed on
    September 11, 2006, concurrent with the 14 year sentence that had been imposed
    in the Hamilton proceedings on February 4, 2005. Accordingly, by imposing a 12
    year sentence, the trial judge effectively imposed a sentence that did not add
    to the period of incarceration the appellant would serve as a result of the
    earlier sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the appellant was sentenced in this proceeding, his appeal from
    the sentence imposed in the Hamilton proceedings was heard by this court. We
    concluded that while a substantial sentence was warranted, the trial judge had
    erred, <i>inter alia</i>, by finding that the appellant was not amenable to
    rehabilitation and by failing to give any weight to the appellant’s status as a
    first offender and we reduced the sentence to 10 years: <i>R. v. Thai</i> 2007
    ONCA 240. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the trial judge did not know this would happen. Despite the
    trial judge’s intention not to extend the appellant’s overall sentence beyond
    the time to be served on the Hamilton sentence, the sentence he imposed would
    result in total sentence of 13 years and 7 months rather than 10 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that this offends the totality principle.
    Although for procedural reasons, the two sets of charges were not dealt with at
    the same time, the totality principle required that due consideration be given
    the overall effective sentence being imposed for these closely related charges.
    The trial judge quite properly endeavoured to respect that principle by
    imposing a sentence that did not add to the earlier sentence. In our view, we
    should take the same approach. As the appellant’s sentence on the Hamilton
    charges was reduced to 10 years, the sentence imposed on the charges now before
    us should be reduced to 8 years and 4 months so that the time to be served on
    this sentence will coincide with the time to be served on the Hamilton
    sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the disparity between the sentence he
    received and the sentence imposed on his co-conspirators, ranging between 3 and
    4 years, cannot be justified. We disagree. First, the appellant’s sentence has
    now been reduced to 8 years and 4 months. Second, a more severe sentence for
    the appellant was entirely warranted. The appellant was the ring-leader in this
    string of robberies, and he was convicted of the substantive offence of robbery
    whereas the co-conspirators were acquitted on the substantive counts and
    convicted only of conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed
    and the sentence is reduced to 8 years and 4 months, concurrent with the other
    sentence the appellant is serving.  </p>
