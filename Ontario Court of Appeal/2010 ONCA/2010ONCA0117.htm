  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Charges</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was charged with six counts of
    sexual offences, four relating to L.S. and two relating to Z.S.  The L.S.
    counts, sexual assault, sexual interference (two counts) and invitation to
    sexual touching, involved acts of vaginal fondling and a single allegation of <i>fellatio</i>,
    beginning in January 2004 and ending in late September 2005.  The Z.S. counts,
    allegations of sexual assault and sexual interference, related to three
    incidents of vaginal fondling between the end of October 2005 and the end of
    February 2006, shortly before the appellants arrest.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Trial Proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the outset of the appellants trial, the
    prosecutor tendered evidence of an interview of the appellant by the
    investigating officer and three statements of Z.S. to her CAS worker and the
    investigating officer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge excluded the appellants police
    interview but admitted Z.S.s statement to her CAS worker and her two
    videotaped interviews by the investigating officer.  The admission of these
    out-of-court statements is the principal ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not apply for severance at the
    opening of trial, nor did the prosecutor apply to have the evidence of each
    complainant admitted as evidence of similar acts on the counts relating to the
    other complainant.  The similar act application was made by the prosecutor
    after both counsel had made their closing submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge ruled on the admissibility of
    the out-of-court statements of Z.S. at the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i> conducted at the beginning of the trial.  The ruling on the similar act
    application forms part of the reasons for judgment delivered about seven weeks
    after final argument.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Calarco advances two grounds of appeal. 
    Each ground has to do with the admission or use of evidence that is generally
    presumptively inadmissible in a criminal case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first ground of appeal asserts error in
    admitting evidence of Z.S.s statement to her CAS worker and two videotaped
    interviews of Z.S. by the investigating officer.  The appellant says that the
    trial judge applied the wrong principles in determining the reliability of the
    police interviews and failed to provide sufficient reasons to permit meaningful
    appellate review of her decision to admit Z.S.s disclosures to her CAS worker.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second ground of appeal challenges the
    correctness of the trial judges determination to apply the evidence of each
    complainant as evidence of similar acts in determining whether the allegations
    of the other complainant had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  According
    to the appellant, the evidence was simply evidence of general propensity with
    minimal probative value on any contested issue and significant prejudicial
    effect.  Here, as well, the reasons of the trial judge are so sparse, the
    appellant asserts, that they do not permit meaningful appellate review.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            First Ground of Appeal: The Admissibility of
    the Hearsay Statements of Z.S.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Z.S. first disclosed the appellants conduct to Jeff Laforet, her CAS
    worker, in February 2006.  Laforet notified Z.S.s foster parents, L.M. and her
    husband, immediately.  The foster parents agreed to ensure that the appellant
    would not visit their home while the police investigation was ongoing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police investigation began shortly after Z.S. disclosed the
    appellants conduct to Laforet.  A police officer interviewed Z.S. on March 7,
    2006, and again on March 23, 2006.  Both interviews were videotaped and later
    transcribed.  </p>

    governing the principled approach to the exceptional admission of hearsay may
    be divided into two groups depending upon the nature of the statement tendered
    for reception. The first group, which includes detailed, lengthy, videotaped
    statements offered when a witness holds the truth hostage, follows the lead of <i>R.
    v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740. The second group, invoked for
    spontaneous brief utterances, applies where the declarants cannot testify,
    usually for reasons of their death or other circumstances beyond the partys or
    witnesss control.  These statements are governed by <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [1990]
    2 S.C.R. 531, <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915 and their descendants. 
    Despite some overlap between them, Mr. Calarco contends that the two groups or

    to appreciate the distinction between these two discrete paths to
    admissibility, applied the wrong considerations and reached an incorrect
    result. The police statement was lengthy. Cross-examination upon it would
    almost certainly have revealed inconsistencies.  The trial judge applied the <i>Khan/Smith</i> line of authorities to this statement.  <i>B. (K.G.)</i> was the appropriate
    standard in light of the length of the statement and the unavailability of the
    declarant for cross-examination.  A videotaped police interview is not a
    substitute for the traditional methods of testing evidence.  To dilute the reliability
    requirement invites proof by videotape, an undesirable and unnecessary method

    the adjective law permits alternative routes to admissibility for evidence that
    is relevant and material, we leave it to the proponent of the evidence to
    choose the basis upon which she or he rests the case for admissibility, and to
    the judge to decide whether the prerequisites to the chosen basis of
    admissibility have been established. It is no answer for the opponent to say
    that the requirements of some other basis of admissibility would not have been
    met, thus the proponents case for admissibility must fail.  For example, just
    because a business record would fail to achieve admissibility under s. 30 of

    hearsay rule, the prerequisites to admissibility of an out-of-court statement
    for its truth are necessity and reliability.  It is well-settled that the
    requirement of reliability may be met on the basis of two different grounds. 
    Neither excludes consideration of the other.  Sometimes, the circumstances in
    which the hearsay statement came about make it sufficiently reliable that
    contemporaneous cross-examination would add little, if anything, to the
    process.  In other instances, the evidence may not be so cogent, but the
    circumstances allow for sufficient testing of the evidence by means other than
    contemporaneous cross-examination: <i>Khelawon </i>at paras. 49, 62, 63; <i>Couture</i> at para. 80; <i>Devine</i> at para. 22. These grounds are simply means or ways

    rich in cross-examination potential to test inconsistencies.  It is <i>not </i>the
    length of the statement, nor the manner of its recording, however, that engages
    the principles of <i>B. (K.G.)</i>.  To determine whether hearsay should be
    admitted under the principled exception, more particularly following the regime
    of <i>B. (K.G.)</i> because of the <i>length</i> of the statement would be to
    beat a hasty retreat from principle and flexibility, on the one hand, to

    is clear from <i>B. (K.G.) </i>itself and other cases that follow its lead that <i>B. (K.G.) </i>applies only where the proponent attempts to introduce the
    prior inconsistent statement of the declarant, a witness in the proceedings, as
    substantive evidence.  The declarant is available for cross-examination on both
    his or her trial evidence and the prior inconsistent statement: <i>U.&nbsp;(F.J.)</i> at para. 35; <i>Khelawon</i> at para. 84; <i>Devine</i> at paras. 22, 23.  That

    on often suspect evidence about the offence(s) charged) and moral prejudice
    (findings of guilt based on bad personhood).  In trials by judge alone, like

    moral prejudice is significantly lessened: <i>R. v. B. (T.)</i> (2009), 95 O.R.

    for which the evidence is proferred and the other evidence in the case: <i>Handy</i> at para. 78.  Where the evidence of similar acts is summoned in support of
    proof of the <i>actus reus</i>, it is not an invariable requirement that there
    be a strong peculiarity or unusual distinctiveness underlying the events being
    compared: <i>Handy</i> at para. 81.  The cogency of evidence of similar acts
    may arise from the repetitive and predictable nature of an accuseds conduct in
    closely defined circumstances.  What becomes necessary in such cases is a
    persuasive degree of connection between the events of alleged similar acts and
    the offence charged in order to be capable of raising the necessary inferences: <i>Shearing</i> at paras. 48 and 50.  The underlying unity need not lie in the
    distinctive nature of the acts themselves but may reside in the circumstances
    in which those acts occurred.</span></p>

    at trial was that the evidence of each complainant, L.S. and Z.S., proved the
    allegations each made beyond a reasonable doubt without the need for recourse
    to evidence of similar acts. The trial judge approached the case in the same
    manner and concluded that the evidence established the guilt of the appellant
    on each count.  In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge did <i>not</i> rely on evidence of similar acts.  It follows, in my view, that the correctness
    of the trial judges ruling on admissibility, thus her reliance on evidence of
    similar acts to complete proof across counts, is of no consequence to the
    decision on this appeal.  </span></p>
