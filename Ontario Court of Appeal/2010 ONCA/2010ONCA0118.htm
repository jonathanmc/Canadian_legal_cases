  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Linda D. Jackson (the “appellant”) was elected mayor of Vaughan.  As a
    candidate in a municipal election, she was required to file financial
    statements relating to her campaign finances.  A compliance audit of her
    election campaign finances <span lang=EN-US>revealed apparent contraventions of
    the <i>Municipal Elections Act, 1996</i>, S.O. 1996, c. 32 (the “<i>Act”</i>).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>After receiving the compliance audit report, the
    Council of the City of Vaughan (“Council”) passed a by-law authorizing the
    commencement of legal proceedings against the appellant.  Her application to
    have the by-law quashed and the relevant legislative provisions struck down was
    unsuccessful.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>She appeals, asking this court for an order preventing
    those legal proceedings from continuing.  For the reasons that follow, I would
    dismiss the appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As s. 81 of the <i>Act </i>is central to the appeal, it is set out in
    full in Schedule “A” to these reasons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Linda D. Jackson was elected as the Mayor of the City of Vaughan (the
    “City”) on November 13, 2006.  As a candidate in a municipal election, she was
    required to comply with the <i><span lang=EN-US>Act</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
    including the requirement to file a financial statement and auditor’s report reflecting
    her campaign finances.   </span>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On or about May 14, 2007, two residents of the City (the “complainants”), <span lang=EN-US>brought an application under ss. 81(1) and (2) of the <i>Act</i>,
    seeking a compliance audit of the appellant’s election campaign finances. 
    Relying on her filed financial statements and auditor’s report, the
    complainants asserted that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the
    appellant had contravened a provision of the <i>Act </i>related to campaign
    finances.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On May 22, 2007, Council deferred consideration of the
    application on the basis that it wished to wait until the last supplementary
    filing date had passed for the reporting of election expenses.  The
    complainants appealed to the Ontario Court of Justice under s. 81(3.3) of the <i>Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 19, 2008, Justice L. Favret of the
    Ontario Court of Justice allowed the appeal and ordered the City to appoint an
    auditor to conduct a compliance audit for the period which the appellant’s financial
    statement covered, namely April 6, 2006 to December 31, 2006.  Following the
    audit, the auditor was required to report the findings to Council, pursuant to
    s. 81(7) of the <i>Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly after Favret J.’s order, Council issued
    a request for proposal for an auditor to conduct a compliance audit of the
    appellant’s 2006 municipal election campaign finances in accordance with s.
    81(6) of the <i>Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the end of March 2008, the complainants filed
    a second application for a compliance audit of the appellant’s election
    campaign finances within the initial reporting period and during a supplementary
    reporting period.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 31, 2008, Council appointed Ken Froese
    of LECG Canada Ltd. and Glen R. Davison, C.A., to conduct a compliance audit of
    the appellant’s campaign expenses for the 2006 municipal election for the
    period of April 6, 2006 to December 31, 2006.  It also directed that a second compliance
    audit be conducted for the appellant’s campaign finances for the period of April
    6, 2006 to December 31, 2007.  The two audits were to be combined and the results
    were to be presented in a single report (the “compliance audit report”).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 18, 2008, Council received the
    compliance audit report.  The report was comprehensive, neutrally framed and
    factual.  It identified numerous apparent contraventions of the election
    campaign finance rules under the <i>Act</i>, ranging from matters such as
    excess campaign spending to missing postal codes on the addresses of some
    contributors, contrary to the requirements for the financial statements set out
    in the prescribed form.  The report contained no conclusions or opinions on
    whether legal action should be taken against the appellant in respect of the
    apparent contraventions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At its regularly scheduled meeting on June 23,
    2008, Council moved to schedule a special meeting on June 24, 2008, for the
    purposes of dealing with the compliance audit report, and to retain a lawyer, Timothy
    J. Wilkin, to provide legal advice in respect of that report.  It waived the
    requirement of 48 hours notice for a council meeting.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 24, 2008, Council received legal advice
    from Mr. Wilkin in closed session.  After reconvening in public session,
    Council passed a resolution dated June 24, 2008 (the “Resolution”), in which it
    instituted the laying of charges against the appellant for breaches of the <i>Act</i> and retained Mr. Wilkin to conduct the prosecution of those charges.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By-law No. 205-2008 ratified the Resolution. 
    The Resolution reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>WHEREAS Council has received,
    reviewed, and considered the Report of Ken Froese and Glen R. Davison dated
    June 18, 2008, being the Compliance Audit Report regarding the 2006 municipal
    election campaign finances of Linda D. Jackson;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>AND WHEREAS the Compliance Audit
    Report has identified numerous apparent contraventions of the Municipal
    Elections Act, regarding the election campaign finances of Linda D. Jackson;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>AND WHEREAS Council has received
    and considered the legal advice of Timothy J. Wilkin on June 24, 2008;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>AND WHEREAS the obligation to
    commence legal proceedings in respect of such contraventions under the
    Municipal Elections Act falls to Council;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>AND WHEREAS it is important for
    all concerned to avoid any perception of bias as legal proceedings move
    forward.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>NOW THEREFORE THE COUNCIL OF THE
    CITY OF VAUGHAN RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>1.         That the City of Vaughan institute the laying of charges
    against Linda D. Jackson     under the Municipal Elections Act, 1996; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>2.         That Mr. Timothy J. Wilkin of Cunningham, Swan, Carty,
    Little &amp; Bonham LLP, be retained to conduct the prosecutions and to proceed
    in a timely manner; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>3.         That the charges to be laid shall be those for which
    reasonable and probable grounds exist for believing that an offence has been
    committed, as may be determined in the legal opinion of Timothy J. Wilkin; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>4.         That the retainer includes instructions that Timothy J.
    Wilkin have the authority, in his sole discretion:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>i)         to withdraw any charge, or charges, against Linda D.
      Jackson if, in his opinion, the available evidence in respect of a charge or
      charges does not provide a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a conviction; and</span></p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>ii)        to conduct any pre-trial or trial proceedings necessary,
      and to summon such witnesses as may be required including, if necessary, the
      retaining of  experts to appear as witnesses; and</span></p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>iii)       to enter into negotiations with respect to the charges

      conviction; and</span></p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>vi)       to provide regular status reports to the City Solicitor
      for her information.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 8, 2008, Council passed By-law No. 228-2008 reconfirming
    the steps taken in relation to the compliance audit report and the prosecution
    arising from it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 29, 2008, the appellant brought an application to have By-law No.
    205-2008 quashed.  The application was subsequently amended to include a
    request that By-law No. 228-2008 also be quashed (the “By-laws”).  She also
    asked for an order declaring s. 81 of the <i>Act </i> to be contrary to s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i> and, thus, of no force or effect.  One of her key arguments
    in support of this ground was that the relevant provisions in the <i>Act</i> were unconstitutionally vague. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the application was heard and while judgment was on reserve, the
    appellant brought a motion to admit fresh evidence relating to a compliance
    audit report performed in respect of Councillor Joyce Frustaglio.  The
    application judge, Lauwers J., admitted the fresh evidence on the basis that it
    assisted in setting the context within which the vagueness argument could be
    assessed.  He found that the two compliance audit reports were substantially
    the same in terms of format and methodology, and in the auditors’
    interpretations of the <i>Act</i>.  He noted that while there were differences
    between the two reports, they were not significant and were the result of
    factual differences between the two campaigns.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge dismissed the application.  He held that s. 81 of
    the <i>Act</i>, read in context and in conjunction with other relevant provisions
    in the <i>Act</i>, is not impermissibly vague.  He explained that s. 81
    delineates a “zone of risk”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-US> </span>that sets out the boundaries of permissible and
    impermissible campaign finances and expenses.  Further, he found that the
    compliance audit and prosecution processes under s. 81 do not engage s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i>.  He reasoned that there is no real or imminent deprivation
    of life, liberty or security of the person by engaging in such processes under
    the <i>Act</i>.  Moreover, by participating as a candidate in the municipal
    election, the appellant voluntarily subjected herself to the provisions of the <i>Act</i>,
    which required her to provide information on her campaign finances to a
    compliance auditor.  In such circumstances, she cannot assert the right against
    self-incrimination to avoid providing information to the compliance auditor. 
    He also rejected the submission that Council’s acts were so markedly
    inconsistent with the relevant legislation that they amounted to bad faith.  He
    concluded by stating that virtually all of the complaints levied by the
    appellant about the <i>Act</i>, its interpretation and the acceptability of the
    processes followed by Council, could have been raised by the appellant in her defence
    to prosecution.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals to this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge gave thorough, thoughtful reasons for dismissing
    the application.  I see no error in his reasons.  For the reasons that follow, I
    would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>

    erred in failing to find s. 81 of the <i>Act </i>to be of no force and effect
    because it offends the constitutional principle against vagueness.  The rule of
    law, she argues, requires the striking down of legislation which enables the
    exercise of arbitrary power.  Section 81 of the <i>Act</i>, it is contended, is
    that type of legislative provision because it grants discretion but fails to
    give direction on how it should be exercised, thereby permitting its arbitrary
    exercise.  Examples of the alleged vagueness in s. 81 include: the creation of an
    ill-defined power given to an auditor to determine whether there has been a
    contravention of the <i>Act</i>; lack of guidance on what constitutes
    “reasonable grounds”, a “compliance audit” or an “apparent contravention”; and,
    no articulation of the factors that a council is to take into consideration in
    determining whether to grant or refuse an application for a compliance audit or
    commence a legal proceeding pursuant to s. 81.  The uncertainty and vagueness
    of the powers given to the auditors and the meaning of the words used in s. 81,
    it is submitted, are evident in both the Jackson and Frustaglio compliance audit
    reports.        </span></p>

    Convictions for corrupt practices attract fines, imprisonment, forfeiture of
    office and, in certain situations, disqualification from running again for
    office for six years.  When a person is convicted of having contravened the election
    campaign finance rules, however, imprisonment is not a possible penalty.  In
    those circumstances, s. 80(2) permits the imposition of specific penalties
    including forfeiture of office, ineligibility for election until the next

    area of risk.  In cases where conduct falls along those boundaries, the
    statutory language is not vague if a conclusion can be reached as to its
    meaning, through reasoned analysis applying legal criteria.  Legislation must
    not give unfettered discretion to a decision maker because doing so will
    deprive the judiciary of the means of controlling the exercise of the
    discretion.  The provision must give a sufficient indication as to how
    decisions are to be reached and the determinative factors or elements that are to

    found that in carrying out the audit, the auditor is not exercising discretion
    in the legal sense of the word.  The auditor will need to interpret the <i>Act </i>and
    may be incorrect in that interpretation.  However, any errors in that regard are

    81(6) of the <i>Act</i>.  The word “compliance” refers to compliance with a
    provision of the <i>Act</i> relating to election campaign finances.  There is
    nothing vague or ambiguous in the word “compliance”.  It is not for the auditor
    to determine whether an apparent contravention is a real contravention. That
    determination is made by the judge of the Ontario Court of Justice hearing the prosecution. 
    Thus, there is no impermissibly broad delegation of power to the auditor.  The
    compliance audit need not relate only to the matters in the initial
    application.  Section 81(1) is a threshold requirement only.  The audit is
    intended to be comprehensive, even if the trigger is but a single apparent contravention.

    to campaign finances have been complied with and outlining any apparent
    contraventions by the candidate.  As explained above, it is not the task of an
    auditor to determine whether an “apparent contravention” is an actual

    reasons, there is no “unfettered discretion” in a municipal body:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The overriding principles are
    expressed in<i> Baker</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 53: </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>… [D]iscretionary decisions, like
    all other administrative decisions, must be made within the bounds of the
    jurisdiction conferred by the statute … [D]iscretion must still be exercised in
    a manner that is within a reasonable interpretation of the margin of manoeuvre
    contemplated by the legislature, in accordance with the principles of the rule
    of law …, in line with general principles of administrative law governing the
    exercise of discretion, and&nbsp; consistent with the <a
name=reflex-statute-21889853><i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i></a>….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Among the relevant administrative law
    principles are that: power must be exercised for the purpose for which it was
    granted and not for another purpose; the decision maker cannot decline to
    decide an issue remitted to it; the decision must be made on the basis of
    relevant considerations and must not take into account irrelevant
    considerations;<b> </b>decision-making power may not be improperly delegated;
    there must be some evidence to justify decisions of fact; statutory
    preconditions to the exercise of power must be met; there should not be errors
    in the interpretation of legislation; and the decision must not be grossly
    unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Without being exhaustive, it is easy
    to see how these principles would apply to a decision on whether to prosecute
    under s. 81 (10) of the MEA. Possible examples abound. A decision based on concerns
    about maintaining the confidence of the electorate, the integrity of the
    election process and the values of public accountability and transparency would
    be consistent with the statutory purpose and would also be political
    considerations in the highest sense. On the other hand, a decision made to
    advance political ambition by ousting a rival would be for an improper purpose.
    A decision taking into account the scale of the apparent contraventions would
    be taking into account relevant considerations, but one based on personal
    animosity or bias would be improper. A decision to prosecute the slightest
    apparent contravention would run into problems of unreasonableness.</span><span

    and Jackson reports, the application judge found that the reports were
    substantially the same in terms of format, methodology and interpretation of

    make the same findings based on similar facts, any differences between them are
    a result of factual differences.                 </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would dismiss this ground of appeal because,
    as the application judge explained, s. 81 is not impermissibly vague.  A law
    will not be struck down for vagueness simply because reasonable people might
    disagree as to its application to particular facts: see <i>Nova Scotia
    Pharmaceutical Society </i>at p. 640; <i>Cochrane </i>at paras. 43-44.  A lack
    of precision will not defeat a law which provides a degree of clarity capable
    of supporting intelligible debate.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    When the words of s. 81 are given their ordinary meaning and read
    grammatically, in the context of the legislation as a whole including sections
    66-82.1, they delineate boundaries for actions in respect of campaign finances that
    are neither vague nor arbitrary.  Instead, they set out the boundaries of
    permissible and impermissible campaign finance activities which give fair
    notice and operate to limit enforcement discretion.  As well, the
    administrative law principles that apply to municipalities and the terms of the
    City’s by-laws limit Council’s enforcement discretion.  And, ultimately, whether
    a candidate has contravened the <i>Act </i>is a determination made by a judge,
    thereby ensuring judicial oversight of the auditor’s conclusion of an apparent
    contravention.  </span></p>

    vague.      </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DOES SECTION 81 BREACH THE
    APPELLANT’S RIGHTS UNDER S. 7 OF THE <i>CHARTER</i>?</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant has a twofold argument in relation
    to s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  First, she argues that she faces a “real or
    imminent deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person”, contrary to
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  She bases this argument on the fact that, if
    convicted, she may forfeit the office to which she was elected and be deemed
    ineligible to be elected or appointed to any office until the next regular
    election has taken place.  Given that a person may enter politics as a
    vocation, such consequences could potentially have a serious and profound
    effect on the person’s psychological integrity, it is argued, thus amounting to
    a breach of the right to security of the person protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>. 
    The second argument is that the powers of the auditor under s. 81(8), which
    require a candidate in a municipal election to participate in a compliance
    audit, breach the appellant’s right against self-incrimination contrary to s.
    7.     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Again, I reject these submissions, essentially for
    the reasons given by the application judge.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge held </span>that the
    compliance audit and prosecution processes under s. 81 do not engage s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i>.  In respect of the first argument, based on <i>R. v. Jarvis</i>,
    [2002] 3 S.C.R. 757, he concluded that it was “plain” that the
    audit/prosecution process, which is aimed at securing compliance with the rules
    concerning election campaign finances, is regulatory in nature rather than
    criminal or quasi-criminal.  <span lang=EN-US>If the appellant is convicted,
    she may be fined and/or removed from office.  There is no risk of
    incarceration.  </span>By contrast, prosecution under the <i>Act </i>for
    corrupt practices engages a risk of incarceration on conviction.  While there
    is quasi-criminal “penal liability” associated with corrupt practices,
    contraventions of the campaign finance provisions carry administrative or
    “regulatory penalties” in the language of <i>Jarvis</i>.  Furthermore, the
    interests of the candidate are not understood in law to constitute a protected
    aspect of “life, liberty and security of the person” within the meaning of s. 7
    of the <i>Charter</i>.  Loss of the ability to hold elected office for a term may
    trigger stress, anxiety and stigma, but it <span lang=EN-US>does not rise to
    the level of “serious and profound” state-imposed psychological harm necessary
    to engage protection under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>:  see <i>Blencoe v. British
    Columbia (Human Rights Commission</i>), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307 at paras. 81-83.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In relation to the second argument, the application judge reasoned
    that by participating as a candidate in the municipal election, the appellant voluntarily
    subjected herself to the provisions of the <i>Act</i>.  Those legislative
    provisions required her to maintain and file detailed information regarding her
    election expenses; they also entitled the auditor to obtain that information
    during the compliance audit.  In such circumstances, she had no reasonable
    expectation of confidentiality concerning any of the matters required to be
    reported and cannot assert the right against self-incrimination to avoid
    providing information to the compliance auditor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore, the information being considered by the auditors was
    not collected at a time when the relationship between the appellant and the
    City was adversarial in nature.  The information was statutorily compelled and
    provided in response to a defined regulatory requirement.  That requirement was
    not coercive in nature as it arose only after the appellant made the conscious
    choice to participate in the election.  In such circumstances, it does not
    appear that the principle against self-incrimination is engaged: see <i>R. v.
    Fitzpatrick</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 154 at paras. 33-46.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I do not accept the premise underlying the appellant’s position
    on this ground of appeal, namely, that s. 81 gives investigative powers to the
    auditors and delegates to them the power to determine whether the appellant should
    be prosecuted.  In <i>Jarvis</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada states that the
    distinction between audits and investigations under the <i>Income Tax Act </i>is
    whether the predominant purpose of the auditor’s inquiry is penal liability:
    see para. 88.  This is a contextual determination that is made after a
    consideration of all the factors that bear on the inquiry.  Generally, however,
    where there is an important state interest at stake – such as maintaining the
    integrity of democratic elections – courts should be careful to avoid creating
    “procedural shackles” and rendering nugatory the state’s ability to investigate
    and obtain evidence of offences:  <i>Jarvis </i>at paras. 89-90.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the application judge states at para. 131 of his reasons, the
    purpose of the compliance audit is to determine whether the candidate is in
    apparent contravention of the legislative requirements for campaign finances. 
    That is, the predominant purpose is fact finding, not determining penal
    liability.  In any event, where the audit report indicates that there is an
    apparent contravention, prosecution is not automatic.  It is the municipal
    council that must determine whether to commence legal proceedings.          </p>

    issue.  The application judge found that once Council decided to commence legal
    proceedings in relation to the appellant, an adversarial relationship between
    her and the municipality came into being.  On the principles enunciated in <i>Jarvis</i>,
    the use of the auditor’s powers respecting the appellant thereafter would
    violate her s. 7 rights.  Consequently, once the decision to prosecute was
    made, the application judge viewed the auditors’ mandate as having been exhausted,
    leaving them without further authority to proceed.<a href="#_ftn6"

    finances.  Based on the compliance audit report, Council exercised that power. 
    In para. 1 of the Resolution that was confirmed by By-law No. 205-2008, Council
    instructed the City to “institute the laying of charges” against the appellant
    under the <i>Act</i>.  In so doing, Council exercised its statutory power –

    charges to lay and how to handle them).   As I have said, it was Council who had
    the power to decide whether a legal proceeding would be commenced against the
    appellant and it was Council who exercised that power.  However, as a corporate
    body, the municipality can only act through its agents.  Having made the
    decision to prosecute, it was necessary to give effect to that decision. 
    Council did so by retaining outside counsel.  In the circumstances, not only
    was it reasonable to delegate the prosecution to a person with the appropriate
    expertise and qualifications, it was necessary as it would have been difficult,
    if not inappropriate, for any City employee to act as the prosecutor in the
    proceedings.  The difficulties inherent in the situation are reflected in one of
    the recitals to the Resolution, which says “Whereas it is important for all
    concerned to avoid any perception of bias as legal proceedings move forward”.  </span></p>

    mechanism that Council used to implement its decision.  Contrary to the

    discretion.  In the Resolution that By-law No. 205-2008 ratifies, Council
    imposed conditions within which Mr. Wilkin must act.  He is directed to proceed
    in a timely manner (para. 2) and to lay charges only where reasonable and

    been committed (para.3).  </span></p>

    negotiations for the purposes of establishing an agreed statement of facts, a
    plea bargain or a joint submission to the court in respect of penalty; enter
    into a plea bargain agreement; establish what penalty is to be sought on
    conviction; and, provide regular status reports to the City solicitor. 
    However, I understand from the City that the powers given to Mr. Wilkin by para.
    4 do nothing more than give him the kind of prosecutorial discretion normally
    exercised by municipal officials who prosecute infractions of municipal
    by-laws.    </span></p>

    was necessary, reasonable and prudent.  Was it lawful?  A municipality is the
    recipient of delegated authority.  Accordingly, it is trite law that in the
    absence of express statutory authority to delegate, a municipality must
    exercise the powers it has been given – it cannot delegate their exercise to
    another.  Having said that, the courts have recognized that it is necessary for
    municipalities to delegate to others the implementation of their decisions. 
    Thus, the common law has permitted municipalities to delegate administrative or
    ministerial functions, so long as the standards which are to govern the
    exercise of those delegated functions are sufficiently clearly spelled out. 
    Put another way, where the delegated administrative function requires the
    exercise of discretion, the by-law must give clear direction on how the
    discretion is to be exercised.  Some examples are illustrative of this point.</span></p>

    S.C.R.  8, the City of Hamilton passed a by-law in which, among other things,
    it gave the City Clerk the power to issue permits authorizing service stations
    to remain open during stated hours and to grant extension permits to occupiers
    of gasoline shops except those who “according to evidence satisfactory to the
    City Clerk” were found to have failed to keep their shops open during the

    In making this determination, the Court referred to the fact that Council had
    laid down, in the by-law, the times during which the permits could authorize
    shops to remain open, the proportion of total occupiers which were to make up
    the groups entitled to receive permits on certain days, that permits were to be
    issued to groups in rotation, and that all occupiers were entitled to receive
    permits except those who failed to remain open in accordance with the terms of
    their existing permits.  However, the Court held invalid those parts of the
    by-law which permitted the Clerk to grant extensions on “evidence satisfactory
    to the City Clerk” because Council had not prescribed the state of facts which
    would render an occupier ineligible to receive a permit.  Absent express
    authorizing language in the enabling legislation, it was an impermissible
    delegation as it gave the Clerk the power to decide such matters on the basis
    of evidence that the Clerk found to be sufficient.   </span></p>

    and without notice.  Consequently, Council has the power to revoke Mr. Wilkin’s
    appointment as prosecutor at any time.  In my view, this means that Council
    retains an overriding oversight power.  Second, the court hearing the
