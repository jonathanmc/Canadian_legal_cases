  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a Crown appeal.  The main question on the appeal is whether the
    trial judge erred in law in finding that the respondent, Aliu Imoro, was
    entrapped by the police into committing drug trafficking offences.  Two
    subsidiary questions also arise: whether the trial judge erred in considering
    the issue of entrapment at the beginning of the trial rather than at the end of
    the trial after making a finding that the accused was guilty; and whether the
    trial judge erred in the remedy she imposed – an order excluding the evidence
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> rather than an order staying proceedings
    for an abuse of process.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The facts giving rise to these questions are
    brief and not in dispute.  The police received an anonymous tip that a man was
    selling drugs on the twelfth floor of an apartment building on Jane Street in
    Toronto.  They decided to investigate the tip.  An undercover officer went to
    the apartment building and took the elevator to the twelfth floor.  When the
    elevator doors opened, a man, who turned out to be Mr. Imoro, approached the
    officer and said, “Come with me.”  The officer responded, “You can hook me up?” 
    Mr. Imoro answered, “Yeah man.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Imoro led the officer and another man who
    had been on the elevator with the officer to his apartment.  Once inside, Mr.
    Imoro sold some marijuana to the other man.  Mr. Imoro then asked the officer
    what he needed.  The officer said “hard”, meaning crack cocaine.  Mr. Imoro
    said that he had only “soft”, meaning powder cocaine.  The officer asked for
    $40 worth.  Mr. Imoro gave him a bag of powder cocaine from some prepackaged
    supplies.  The officer then gave Mr. Imoro $40, using police “buy money”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The next day, the officer went back to Mr.
    Imoro’s apartment.  Mr. Imoro opened the door, greeted the officer and sold him
    another $40 worth of powder cocaine.  The police then obtained a search warrant
    for Mr. Imoro’s apartment.  They executed the warrant and seized cocaine,
    marijuana and the police buy money.  Mr. Imoro was arrested and charged with
    two counts each of trafficking in cocaine, possession of controlled substances
    (cocaine and marijuana) for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of the proceeds
    of crime.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    not guilty.  Although he did not testify, he claimed entrapment and brought a
    motion to exclude the evidence or stay the proceedings.  </span></p>

    sitting without a jury she could consider the issue of entrapment before making
    a finding of guilt.  She therefore dealt with the issue as a pre-trial <i>Charter</i> motion.  She found that the conduct of the undercover officer amounted to
    entrapment. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>       The doctrine of entrapment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The doctrine of entrapment reflects judicial
    disapproval of unacceptable police or prosecutorial conduct in investigating
    crimes.  The contours of the doctrine were discussed at length by Lamer J. in <i>R.
    v. Mack</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903.  He sought to balance two competing
    objectives.  On the one side, he recognized that the police must have
    considerable leeway in the techniques they use to investigate criminal activity. 
    Especially in the investigation of consensual crimes – of which drug
    trafficking is an example – traditional techniques may be ineffective.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the other side, Lamer J. also recognized that
    the power of the police to investigate criminal activity cannot be untrammeled. 
    In their efforts to investigate, deter and repress crime, the police should not
    be permitted to randomly test the virtue of citizens, or to offer citizens an
    opportunity to commit a crime without reasonable suspicion that they are
    already engaging in criminal activity, or worse, to go further and use tactics
    designed to induce citizens to commit a criminal offence.  To allow any of
    these investigative techniques would offend our notions of decency and fair
    play.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lamer J. struck the balance between these
    objectives by concluding that entrapment arises in either of two situations:
    first, when state authorities, acting without reasonable suspicion or for an
    improper purpose, provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence;
    and second, even having reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a good
    faith inquiry, the police go beyond providing an opportunity to commit a crime
    and actually induce the commission of an offence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ordinarily, when entrapment is claimed, the
    essential elements of the offence charged have been made out.  However, if
    entrapment is subsequently found, the court will not allow the Crown to
    maintain a conviction because to do so would be an abuse of process and bring
    the administration of justice in disrepute.  So instead, the court will stay
    the proceedings.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       Application to this case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present appeal we are dealing with the
    first of Lamer J.’s two scenarios: whether the undercover officer entrapped Mr.
    Imoro because he gave him an opportunity to engage in drug trafficking without
    reasonable suspicion.  The second of Lamer J.’s two scenarios is not in issue
    because on any interpretation of the evidence the undercover officer did not
    induce the drug trafficking that occurred.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To make out entrapment on the first scenario
    requires two findings: first, a finding that the police provided an opportunity
    to commit an offence; and second, a finding that the police did so without
    reasonable suspicion.  The trial judge found entrapment occurred at the time of
    the initial contact between the undercover officer and Mr. Imoro.  She found
    that the officer’s question, “Can you hook me up?” was the first reference to
    drugs and amounted to giving Mr. Imoro an opportunity to traffic.  She also
    found that when the officer gave Mr. Imoro the opportunity to sell drugs he did
    not have reasonable suspicion that Mr. Imoro was engaged in drug trafficking. 
    The critical findings of the trial judge are at para. 39 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I, therefore, find that Officer
    Matthews was the one who first raised the subject and that he was the one who
    asked to purchase drugs; there was no prior offer by Mr. Imoro.  There is no
    evidence that would support a finding that Officer Matthews had a reasonable
    suspicion that Mr. Imoro was engaged in criminal activity before he asked him
    if he could “hook” him up.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I accept the trial judge’s finding that when the
    officer asked Mr. Imoro, “Can you hook me up?” he did not have reasonable
    suspicion that Mr. Imoro was engaged in drug trafficking.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, I cannot accept the trial judge’s
    companion finding that the officer’s question provided Mr. Imoro with an
    opportunity to sell drugs.  That view of the evidence mischaracterizes what
    occurred.  This mischaracterization stems from a failure to properly
    distinguish between legitimately investigating a tip and giving an opportunity
    to commit a crime: see <i>R. v. Townsend</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 6516 (Gen. Div.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By the question “Can you hook me up?” all the
    officer really asked Mr. Imoro was whether he was a drug dealer.  The question
    was simply a step in the police’s investigation of the anonymous tip.  It did
    not amount to giving Mr. Imoro an opportunity to traffic in drugs.  That
    opportunity was given later when the officer and his fellow passenger in the
    elevator were inside Mr. Imoro’s apartment.  By then, having observed a drug
    transaction between Mr. Imoro and the other man, the officer certainly had
    reasonable suspicion – indeed virtually certain belief – that Mr. Imoro was
    engaged in drug trafficking.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Therefore, I conclude that there was no evidence
    to support the trial judge’s finding of entrapment.  A finding unsupported by
    any evidence is an error of law: see <i>R. v. Whittle</i> (1992), 59 O.A.C. 218
    (C.A.), aff’d [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914.  The Crown, although limited to appeals on a
    question of law, is entitled to succeed on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would set aside the finding of entrapment and
    the acquittals based on it.  Mr. Imoro acknowledges that apart from the issue
    of entrapment, he was guilty of the offences charged.  At para. 72 of her
    reasons, the trial judge noted that she would have found Mr. Imoro guilty:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I should state at the outset, that
    had I decided to proceed with the Defence application at the conclusion of the
    trial, I would have found Mr. Imoro guilty of all the charges based on the
    evidence and his admissions.  After the <i>voir dire</i> concluded, Mr. Moss
    made a formal admission that any drugs found in Mr. Imoro’s possession were
    there for the purpose of trafficking, that it was Mr. Imoro who the officer
    dealt with and that there were no issues as to jurisdiction or continuity.  Mr.
    Moss did not raise any defence, save for his argument based on entrapment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the proper disposition of this
    appeal is to set aside the acquittals, enter verdicts of guilty and return the
    case to the trial court for the sentencing of Mr. Imoro.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Because of this disposition, it is unnecessary
    to address the two subsidiary issues raised by the Crown.  However, as these
    issues were canvassed at length by the trial judge and were argued before us, I
    will say a few words about each.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Should a claim on entrapment be considered at
    the beginning of the trial?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that as she was sitting without a jury, she could
    consider whether the undercover officer’s conduct amounted to entrapment at the
    outset of the trial before determining whether Mr. Imoro was guilty.  This
    holding, respectfully, is contrary to <i>Mack</i> and to the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s later decision in <i>R. v. Pearson</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mack</i>, Lamer J. stated at p. 972: “[B]efore a judge considers
    whether a stay of proceedings lies because of entrapment, it must be absolutely
    clear that the Crown had discharged its burden of proving beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the accused had committed all the essential elements of the offence.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although in <i>Mack</i> the accused was tried by a jury, I do not read
    Lamer J.’s statement as being limited to jury trials.  In the very next
    sentence on p. 972 he added, “if this is not clear and there is a jury, the
    guilt or innocence of the accused must be determined apart from evidence which
    is relevant only to the issue of entrapment.”  Why should guilt or innocence be
    determined before a judge considers entrapment?  Lamer J. provides the answer:
    “This protects the rights of an accused to an acquittal where the circumstances
    so warrant.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pearson</i>, Lamer C.J. and Major J. writing for the majority
    noted that entrapment is not a conventional defence.  It puts in issue not the
    accused’s culpability but the conduct of the state.  Thus, as the majority
    notes at para. 15, “It arises after a fair trial has found the accused guilty.” 
    Accordingly, a claim of entrapment leads to a “two-stage trial”.  At the first
    stage, the trier of fact determines whether the accused is guilty.  If the
    accused is found guilty, the trial moves to the second stage where the judge
    considers the claim of entrapment.  In setting out these two stages, the
    Supreme Court did not distinguish between jury and non-jury trials.  Whatever
    the mode of trial, the judge ought to consider entrapment only after a finding
    of guilt.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    that “a claim of entrapment is in reality a motion for a stay of proceedings based
    on the accused’s allegation of an abuse of process.”  Indeed, a stay is the
    standard remedy where entrapment is established.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, in this case the trial judge held
    that the evidence obtained by the police as a result of entrapment could be,
    and in this case should be, excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. 
    Having decided the question of entrapment at the outset of the trial before
    determining guilt, and having excluded the evidence against Mr. Imoro under s.
    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>, the trial judge was able to enter acquittals.  </span></p>

    of evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> rather than a stay of
    proceedings for abuse of process distorts the underpinnings of the doctrine of
    entrapment.  Admittedly, in <i>Mack</i>, as the trial judge noted in this case,
    Lamer J. left open “the propriety of a s. 24(2) application to exclude evidence
    because of entrapment.”  Similarly, I need not decide the issue here because I
    would set aside the trial judge’s finding of entrapment.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, I think the Crown’s contention has
    merit.  A court considers s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> where the state has
    improperly obtained evidence of an offence.  A court considers entrapment where
    the accused alleges the state has improperly brought about the commission of
    the offence.  Under s. 24(2), the court must determine whether the admission of
    the evidence would compromise the fairness of the trial.  On a claim of
    entrapment, the court does not consider the fairness of the trial, but instead
    whether it was fair that there was a trial.  These considerations suggest that
    a s. 24(2) remedy is ill-suited for a finding of entrapment.</span></p>

    police conduct amounted to entrapment was an error of law because there was no
    evidence to support it.  I would set aside that finding and the acquittals of
    Mr. Imoro.  As he otherwise acknowledged his guilt, I would enter verdicts of guilty
    and return the case to the trial court for sentencing.</span></p>
