  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>I.         OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was charged with one count of fraud and several
    counts of forgery.  The prosecution alleges that between May 2000 and September
    2002, the respondent defrauded the Phaeton Group of Companies (“Phaeton”) of
    approximately $1.8 million.  Phaeton includes a number of related companies
    that operate numerous car dealerships, all of which are controlled by Mr. Emain
    Kadrie, a businessman who resides in Dubai.  Phaeton employed the respondent as
    its CFO beginning in 1993.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent and PAG did not part on good terms.  Phaeton sued the
    respondent in September 2003.  In December 2003, Mr. Kadrie caused a formal
    complaint to be filed against the respondent with the Institute of Chartered
    Accountants of Ontario.  In February 2005, Mr. Kadrie went to the police with
    the allegations that led to these charges.  The respondent claims that all of
    these proceedings involve the same allegations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the criminal proceedings, the Crown contends that the respondent,
    using his position as CFO, caused a number of cheques to be drawn on Phaeton’s
    accounts.  These cheques were to the benefit of the respondent or companies he
    controlled.  On the Crown’s theory, the respondent, as a designated signing
    officer, signed these cheques in his own name, and negotiated them with forged
    signatures of other Phaeton officers.  In laying the charges, the police relied
    on a forensic audit prepared for Phaeton by its accountant, Michael Bondy (the
    “Bondy Audit”) and various “will states”, including one from Mr. Kadrie.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout the various proceedings initiated by Mr. Kadrie, the
    respondent has maintained that any money he received from Phaeton was due to
    him as compensation for his employment.  He asserts that funds he received
    between May 2000 and September 2002, were referable either to compensation owed
    for that time period or deferred compensation owing to him for work done prior
    to May 2000.  The respondent maintains that any dispute over the amounts owed
    or taken is purely a civil matter.  He asserts that Mr. Kadrie has misused the
    criminal process in an effort to recover a civil debt.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The merits of the allegations have not been litigated.  The trial
    judge, on a pre-trial motion, stayed the proceedings on the grounds that the
    respondent had been denied his constitutional right to make full answer and
    defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I read the trial judge’s reasons, she found a denial of the respondent’s
    right to make full answer and defence on two grounds.  First, she held that the
    Crown’s failure to produce a second forensic audit that conformed to the respondent’s
    reasonable requests constituted a violation of the Crown’s “duty to
    investigate”, and precipitated a denial of the respondent’s right to make full
    answer and defence (see paras. 51, 70-74).  Second, the trial judge found that
    the Crown had undertaken before the pre-trial judge to obtain a second forensic
    audit that was “full and independent” and had then failed to do so (see para.
    69).    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent also argued on the pre-trial motion that his right
    to a trial within a reasonable time had been breached and that, as such, the
    proceedings should be stayed.  While the trial judge did not find a breach of
    s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, she held that if she were to order the full
    forensic audit to which the defence was entitled, the resulting additional delay
    would push the case beyond constitutionally tolerable time limits (see para.
    82).  Consequently, the trial judge concluded that the only appropriate remedy
    for the breach of the respondent’s right to make full answer and defence was a
    stay.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would allow the appeal.  The Crown was not under any duty,
    constitutional or otherwise, to obtain the forensic audit demanded by the
    defence.  Its failure to do so did not result in any constitutional violation
    of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  Furthermore, there was
    no evidence from which the trial judge could conclude that the Crown undertook
    to obtain the “full and independent” audit demanded by the defence. 
    Consequently, she was wrong in law to hold that the Crown breached that
    undertaking.  Finally, had the trial proceeded on its merits as scheduled,
    there would have been no violation of s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'><span style='line-height:200%'>II.        FACTUAL
    BACKGROUND</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The charges were laid in June 2005.  There were several adjournments
    between June 2005 and late-January 2006.  The respondent’s counsel hoped to
    persuade the Crown that the matter did not belong in the criminal courts.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the first pre-trial, held on January 24, 2006, counsel for the
    respondent voiced concerns about the Bondy Audit.  He pointed out that Mr.
    Bondy’s firm, Phaeton’s accountants, had employed the respondent before he went
    to Phaeton, and suggested that Mr. Bondy may have a personal animus against the
    respondent.  Counsel also opined that the scope of the Bondy Audit was far too
    narrow.  He advised the court that the respondent would advance the defence of
    “entitlement”, meaning that any funds the respondent received were owed to him
    as compensation for work he performed during his tenure at Phaeton.  Counsel
    maintained that in order to properly explore the “entitlement” defence the
    audit must address the financial affairs of Phaeton for the entire 9 years of
    the respondent’s employment, and not just the 2-year timeframe covered by the
    charges.  The pre-trial judge told counsel that he saw merit in both concerns.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The day after the pre-trial, Crown counsel, no doubt influenced
    by the pre-trial judge’s observations, instructed the investigating officer to
    contact Mr. Kadrie and advise him that given Mr. Bondy’s potential bias against
    the respondent, a second audit was necessary.  The officer conveyed to Mr.
    Kadrie the Crown’s opinion that without a second audit, the chances of
    conviction were so low that they would not justify the continuation of the
    prosecution.  The investigating officer also advised Mr. Kadrie that if a
    second audit was to be obtained, Mr. Kadrie would have to shoulder its costs. 
    It was not the policy of the London police to fund forensic audits and the
    London Crown Attorney’s Office declined to do so in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Very shortly after the pre-trial, the
    Crown and the defence began discussing the nature and scope of the proposed new
    audit.  It was understood that Mr. Kadrie was the only source of funds and
    would have to pay for whatever audit was performed.  Counsel also agreed that
    KPMG should be retained to perform the audit.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The scope of the second audit was
    a bone of contention from the outset.  Counsel for the respondent insisted that
    it must cover the financial affairs of all of the companies during the entire
    time period that the respondent was employed by Phaeton.  He also maintained
    that it should analyze payments made to Mr. Kadrie and other senior managers. 
    Crown counsel took the position that, absent some more specific guidance from
    the defence as to the relevance of documents and material predating the 2-year
    time period covered by the charges, he would propose to limit the audit to that
    period of time.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Between February and June 2006, counsel
    for the respondent and the Crown, along with accountants and civil counsel for
    both parties, met on various occasions.  They continued to debate the scope of
    the proposed second audit.  Counsel for the respondent remained firm.  He put
    it concisely in his correspondence:  </span>“The relevant issue of entitlement
    began in 1993.  That’s when the audit must begin.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Counsel for the respondent also
    advised the Crown that the full audit would reveal crucial failings in Mr.
    Kadrie’s credibility and would demonstrate that there was no merit to the
    forgery allegations.  He did not provide any specifics as to how an audit could
    achieve these results.  Nor did he refer the Crown to any specific
    documentation that might support the “entitlement” defence.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Crown counsel remained firm in his
    position that the far-ranging audit demanded by the respondent could not be
    justified and was not necessary for the Crown’s purposes.  Crown counsel had
    been advised that the audit proposed by counsel for the respondent would cost
    hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Crown counsel put his position this way:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Ross [the accountant with KPMG] indicates that
    without some further delineation by your client as to some specific documents
    and time periods that he alleges supports his defence of entitlement a complete
    audit at this time involving all of the records requested and without some
    further narrowing of the scope would be an incredibly long, arduous,
    unfocussed, and expensive process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By June 2006, Mr. Kadrie had agreed to fund the second audit, at least
    to the extent of $50,000, and KPMG had agreed to perform it.  The specifics of
    the retainer agreement had not been resolved.  The Crown proposed that the
    audit would be limited to the timeframe covered by the charges, subject to expanding
    the audit’s scope if the defence provided a sufficiently particularized and
    meritorious request to do so.  The defence continued to insist that the entire
    timeframe of the respondent’s employment must be covered in the audit.  Counsel
    for the respondent offered to make the respondent’s accountant available to
    assist KPMG and hopefully reduce the costs of the audit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the second pre-trial on June 19, 2006, counsel for the respondent
    expressed concerns that the terms of the second audit had not yet been fixed. 
    He advised the pre-trial judge that recent developments suggested that KPMG’s
    retainer would be exclusively with Mr. Kadrie or Phaeton, and would not involve
    the Crown.  He described this arrangement as “preposterous” and indicative that
    the proposed audit lacked independence.  Counsel for the respondent did not
    want to set a date for the preliminary inquiry while the matters relating to
    the second audit were unresolved.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel, in response to the defence submissions, referred to
    difficulties his superiors had with the proposed language in the initial draft
    of the KPMG retainer, and said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We had to get started somewhere, and of course Mr.
    Kadrie wants to know what it is going to cost.  Mr. Ross [the accountant for
    KPMG] hasn’t seen this room full of documents, and so it was Mr. Ross’s
    suggestion that they at least start with the documents that are necessary to do
    the window as Mr. Trudell [counsel for the respondent] calls it, and then we
    will go from there if necessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The pre-trial judge told counsel
    that if he were the trier of fact, he would be interested in the financial
    relationships among the respondent, Mr. Kadrie and the relevant companies
    during the entire time that the respondent was employed by Phaeton.  He went
    on, however, to indicate that a date for the preliminary inquiry should be
    set.  The pre-trial judge suggested that any inadequacies in the scope of the
    audit would be revealed by cross-examination and could well result in an
    acquittal.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The parties agreed that the
    preliminary inquiry would take four weeks.  In fixing February 5, 2007 as the
    commencement date for the preliminary inquiry, counsel for the respondent
    indicated that the February dates were “the earliest dates available” for a
    four-week preliminary inquiry.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Counsel for the respondent, between
    June and January 2007, maintained and repeated his objections to the proposed
    audit.  He made it clear that he regarded the audit eventually undertaken by
    KPMG as neither independent of Mr. Kadrie, nor sufficiently comprehensive.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>KPMG produced its audit, referable
    to the timeframe covered by the charges, in January 2007.  The conclusions of
    that audit were consistent with the conclusions reached in the Bondy Audit. 
    The KPMG audit was delivered to the respondent’s accountant in the last week of
    January and to counsel on January 30, 2007.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>About one week before the
    preliminary inquiry was to start, counsel for the respondent advised the court
    that due to commitments arising out an ongoing murder trial, he would be unable
    to commence the preliminary inquiry as scheduled.  Counsel indicated that he
    hoped the murder trial would be completed in sufficient time to allow the
    preliminary inquiry to proceed in the last two weeks of the four weeks scheduled. 
    Counsel believed that the preliminary inquiry could be completed in two weeks.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As matters developed, counsel for the respondent was not
    available until the last week of the four-week time period that had been set
    aside for the preliminary inquiry.  On February 26, 2007, the date counsel was
    first available, the respondent indicated <span style='line-height:200%'>he

    said at para. 51:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>The Crown has a duty to ensure a fair process and
    that means it cannot knowingly embark upon a prosecution based upon an
    investigation that is inherently deficient.  It is unfair to expect the accused
    person to take on the task of completing the investigation in order to make
    full answer and defence.</i>  While the Crown is not obliged to go on a fishing
    expedition at the behest of the accused it cannot stand idly by when the
    defendant raises the possibility of a real deficiency in the investigation.  <i>It
    should follow that the Crown’s duty to investigate can only be activated when
    the deficiency raised by the defence is real and not fanciful or speculative</i>. 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    principles, the trial judge observed that the Crown had decided that it would
    not pay for a second audit and that Mr. Kadrie was not willing to pay for the
    audit demanded by the defence.  She continued at para. 74:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Neither position satisfies the need to provide
    sufficient information to the defendant to allow him to present his defence. 
    In these circumstances Mr. Darwish can never be in a position to defend himself.</i> 
    The only conclusion I can reach at this point is that his right to make full
    answer and defence has been compromised and therefore his right under s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i> to be tried in accordance with the principles of fundamental
    justice has been breached.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    constitutional right to make full answer and defence includes the right to have
    the prosecution investigate any defences that are “not fanciful or
    speculative”.  On this approach, the accused is constitutionally entitled to
    have the police pursue a line of investigation if the defence can show that
    there is a realistic possibility that pursuing that investigation will yield
    information that could assist the accused.  This formulation of the right to
    make full answer and defence goes far beyond any description of that right
    previously recognized in the case law.  It is unworkable in practice.  Further,
    it is inconsistent with the philosophy underlying the criminal justice system.  </span></p>

    freestanding constitutional right to an adequate investigation of the charges
    against him or her:  <i>R. v. Barnes</i>, 2009 ONCA 432, at para. 1. 
    Inadequacies in an investigation may lead to the ultimate failure of the
    prosecution, to a specific breach of a <i>Charter</i> right or to a civil
    remedy.  Those inadequacies do not, however, in-and-of-themselves constitute a
    denial of the right to make full answer and defence.  </span></p>

    constitutional right to direct the conduct of the criminal investigation of
    which he or she is the target.  As Hill J. put it in <i>R. v. West</i>, [2001]
    O.J. No. 3406 (S.C.), at para. 75, the defence cannot, through a
    disguised-disclosure demand, “conscript the police to undertake investigatory
    work for the accused”.  See also:  <i>R. v. Schmidt</i> (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d)
    74 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 19.  That is not to say that the police and the Crown
    should not give serious consideration to investigative requests made on behalf
    of an accused.  Clearly, they must.  However, it is the prosecutorial
    authorities that carry the ultimate responsibility for determining the course
    of the investigation.  Criminal investigations involve the use of public
    resources and the exercise of intrusive powers in the public interest. 
    Responsibility for the proper use of those resources and powers rests with those
    in the service of the prosecution, and not with the defence.  </span></p>

    broad as that right is, extend so far as to require the police to investigate
    potential defences.  The Crown’s disclosure obligation was recently described
    in <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66.  The court, at para. 22, reiterated
    the Crown’s obligation, subject to very limited exceptions, to make timely
    disclosure to an accused of all relevant material “in the possession or control
    of the Crown”.  The Crown’s disclosure obligation will also require the Crown,
    in response to defence requests, to take reasonable steps to inquire about and
    obtain relevant information in the possession of some third parties.  Charron
    J. described this aspect of the disclosure obligation at para. 49:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown is not an ordinary litigant.  As a
    minister of justice, the Crown’s undivided loyalty is to the proper
    administration of justice.  As such, Crown counsel who is put on notice of the
    existence of relevant information cannot simply disregard the matter.  Unless
    the notice appears unfounded, Crown counsel will not be able to fully assess
    the merits of the case and fulfil its duty as an officer of the court without
    inquiring further and obtaining the information if it is reasonably feasible to
    do so.  </p>

    requiring the Crown to take reasonable steps to assist an accused in obtaining
    disclosure of relevant material in the possession of a third party, and
    requiring the Crown to conduct investigations that may assist the defence.  The
    former recognizes an accused’s right to relevant information and the practical
    advantage that the Crown may have over the defence when it comes to obtaining
    that information from some third parties.  The latter would require the prosecution
    to effectively surrender control of the investigation to the defence, or
    ultimately face a stay of the criminal charges.  </span></p>

    the premise that material in possession of the prosecutorial authorities that
    is relevant to a criminal prosecution is not the “property” of the Crown, but
    is rather “the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is
    done”:  <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 333 .  This
    rationale fully justifies the broad disclosure obligations imposed on the
    prosecution with respect to material that is in existence.   It does not
    justify an approach that would permit the defence to dictate the course of the
    investigation to prosecutorial authorities.</span></p>

    the assault by a nurse.  The results of that examination were placed in a
    “sexual assault kit”.  The police preserved the kit, but did not attempt to
    have the samples it contained forensically examined.  Disclosure of the kit was
    made to the defence.  The defence argued that, as the samples were potentially
    exculpatory, the Crown was obliged not only to disclose their existence to the
    defence, but also to have the necessary forensic tests performed.  </span></p>

    reading given to it by the trial judge.  In<i> Brown</i>, the accused brought numerous
    pre-trial <i>Charter</i> motions alleging misconduct by various individuals
    engaged in the prosecution of the accused.  Trafford J. recognized that unless
    the Crown directed an investigation into these allegations, the court would not
    be in a position to effectively and efficiently assess the merits underlying
    them (at paras. 38-39).  He held, at para. 40, that once the court determined

    the criminal justice system.  No doubt, the Crown has obligations to an accused
    and to the administration of justice that go beyond those normally imposed on
    opposing counsel in litigation.  However, the criminal justice system remains
    essentially an accusatorial and adversarial one.  The prosecution, which
    includes the Crown and the police, is charged with the responsibility of
    investigating and prosecuting crime in the public interest.  To do so the
    prosecution must investigate allegations, lay charges and prove those charges
    in a criminal proceeding.  To properly perform these functions the prosecution
    must decide on the nature and scope of an investigation.  The accused is
    entitled to the product of that investigation, but is not entitled to dictate
    the nature or scope of that investigation.  </span></p>

    excellent example of the negative consequences flowing from this inordinately
    broad interpretation of an accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  The
    respondent, who had full disclosure of the product of the Crown’s
    investigation, was able to put the Crown in the untenable position of either
    pursuing a line of investigation demanded by the defence at a cost of
    hundreds-of-thousands of dollars, or abandoning the prosecution.  The defence
    put the Crown in this bind simply by asserting that its defence was
    “entitlement” and convincing the trial judge that, from a defence perspective,
    the suggested forensic audit could reasonably be expected to yield helpful
    information for the defence.  Giving this kind of control over the conduct of
    an investigation to the accused, who is, after all, the target of that
    investigation, is unworkable.  It turns the adversarial process at least
    sideways, if not upside down. </span></p>

    investigative requests, I would not want to be taken as discouraging the kind
    of interaction that occurred between counsel in this case.  The defence chose
    to raise the issue of the suitability of the initial audit in the pre-trial
    context.  The Crown, in its role as a minister of justice, was obliged to give
    careful consideration to the defence objections.  Both counsel made efforts to
    come to some consensus as to the nature and scope of the new audit.  They were
    partially successful.  In the end, however, it was for the Crown to decide on how
    to proceed with the second audit.  Assuming that the Crown’s decision was not
    tainted by any improper motive (and no such motive is suggested here), that
    decision did not engage any of the respondent’s constitutional rights.  </span></p>

    the shortcomings alleged by the defence in the KPMG audit produced by the
    prosecution could potentially have provided grist for the fact-finding mill at
    trial.  Counsel, armed with access to all of the relevant documents and the
    audit itself, could have explored any weaknesses in the audit through
    cross-examination of its authors and of Mr. Kadrie.  Counsel also could have
    called evidence from the respondent’s accountant and the respondent himself. 
    These measures have provided accused in countless cases where evidence of this
    kind is relied on by the Crown with an opportunity to make full answer and defence. 
    There is no reason to think that in this case they would not be up to the task
    of providing the respondent with an adequate opportunity to make full answer
    and defence.  If a specific problem arose in the course of the trial that
    adversely affected the respondent’s ability to make full answer and defence – if,
    for example, certain crucial documents turned out to be unavailable – the
    respondent could raise a <i>Charter</i> claim at that time.  The merits of the
    claim would have to be assessed in the context of the trial proceedings and the
    evidence adduced at the trial.  </span></p>
  <h2>(b)  The Breach of the Crown’s Undertaking</h2>

    denied the right to make full answer and defence the trial judge also found
    that the Crown had failed to comply with an undertaking it had given to the
    defence to obtain “a full and independent audit”.  As I read the reasons, the
    trial judge tied the Crown’s failure to comply with its undertaking to the
    respondent’s inability to make full answer and defence without that audit.  </span></p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The difficulties with the original audit and
    complaint were set out before Justice Getliffe [the pre-trial judge] and <i>it
    was agreed that in order for the defendant to be able to make full answer and

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown had agreed that it could not pursue the charges without an
    independent audit.  However, there was never any agreement as to the scope of
    that audit.  Indeed, as summarized above, the Crown and defence debated the
    scope of the second audit for months without arriving at a consensus.  There
    was no evidence that they ever reached any agreement that a “full” audit as
    demanded by the defence was necessary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A finding of fact in the absence of any evidence to support that finding
    constitutes an error in law:  <i>Schuldt v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592,
    at p. 599.   To the extent that the trial judge found a denial of the right to
    make full answer and defence based on a breach of an undertaking to provide a
    “full” audit, that finding is tainted by legal error.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent persuasively argued that even if the trial
    judge was wrong in finding a Crown undertaking to produce a <i>full</i> audit,
    she was correct in holding that the Crown undertook to provide an <i>independent</i> audit.  Counsel submits that the Crown did not live up to this undertaking.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record supports the contention that the KPMG audit was
    not an independent one.  The respondent understood from the outset that Mr.
    Kadrie would pay for the audit; his counsel specifically indicated that this
    arrangement was an appropriate one.  Obviously, as the person paying for the
    audit, Mr. Kadrie could determine its scope by deciding how much he would pay. 
    There is, however, no evidence to support the contention that the ultimate
    scope of the audit prepared by KPMG was a product of any financial limit placed
    on the retainer by Mr. Kadrie.  The Crown proposed from the outset that the
    audit would focus on the timeframe covered by the charges.  The KPMG retainer
    with Phaeton reflected that focus, although it also contemplated the
    examination of some documents outside of that timeframe.  There is simply no
    evidence that Mr. Kadrie demanded as a condition precedent to funding the audit
    that KPMG restrict its scope in performing it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s finding that the audit was not independent confuses
    the question of what work will be done with the independence of that work.  The
    retainer determined what work KPMG would do.  The terms of that retainer were
    settled between KPMG and Phaeton.  The retainer did not, however, surrender
    KPMG’s independent judgment in matters covered by the retainer to Mr. Kadrie or
    anyone else.  The mere fact that the work to be done is circumscribed by the
    terms of a retainer does not mean that the work done is not independent of the
    party required under the terms of the retainer to pay for it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>KPMG produced an audit.  The respondent made no attempt on the pre-trial
    motion to demonstrate, through cross-examination of the author of the audit or
    otherwise, that there was any reason to question KPMG’s independence.  In the
    end, the respondent’s claim that the audit was not independent is based solely
    on the scope of the retainer and the source of the funds for the retainer. 
    Neither necessarily compromised the independence of the audit.  Counsel for the
    respondent, if he wishes, could pursue the respondent’s concerns over the
    independence of the audit in cross-examination at trial.    </p>
  <h2>(c)  The Section 11(b) Claim</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, the trial judge ultimately declined to find a breach
    of s. 11(b).  She did, however, conduct a section 11(b) analysis.  Counsel for
    the respondent, relying on the trial judge’s findings of fact, argues that as
    of the scheduled trial date in October 2007, and apart from any further delay
    that may have been occasioned had a new audit been ordered, this case was
    beyond constitutionally acceptable time limits.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot accept this submission.  The 28 months between the laying of
    the charges in mid-June 2005, and the proposed start of the trial in
    mid-October 2007, is clearly long enough to merit a section 11(b) inquiry.  However,
    apart from about four months, none of the delay is attributable to Crown
    conduct.  As I read the record, having regard to the passage of time between
    the setting of the date for the preliminary inquiry and the preliminary inquiry
    date, as well as the passage of time between the setting of the trial date and
    the actual trial date, the vast majority of the delay is properly characterized
    as neutral or institutional.  The timeline in this case can be conveniently
    broken down into four phases:</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing the reasons for the delay, the trial judge said at para.
    67, “[t]he majority of the delay in this case is directly attributable to the
    efforts to address the issues surrounding the forensic audit.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This finding is contrary to the evidence.  The passage of time between
    mid-June 2005 and late-January 2006 – approximately seven months – was attributable
    to various “intake” procedures, none of which involved the audit.  Counsel
    agreed that this time was neutral for the purposes of s. 11(b).  The delay
    between late-June 2006 and early-February 2007 – approximately seven months –
    was attributable to the unavailability, prior to the latter date, of a
    courtroom for a four-week preliminary inquiry.  While it is true there were
    discussions concerning the audit during this time period, counsel for the
    respondent expressly advised the court that the February date was the earliest date
    available for a four-week preliminary inquiry.  This seven-month block of time
    should be characterized as institutional delay.  Seven months between the
    fixing of a date for the preliminary inquiry and the commencement of the preliminary
    inquiry is within the guidelines set down in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1
    S.C.R. 771.   The Crown submits that the four-week period set aside for the
    preliminary inquiry in February and the remaining period of time before the
    scheduled commencement of the trial, from March through mid-October 2007 –
    approximately seven months – should be attributed to the defence as it was the
    defence that requested the adjournment of the preliminary inquiry in February. 
    This characterization ignores the fact that the defence re-elected and was
    prepared to go to trial in the Ontario Court of Justice.  Consequently, the
    adjournment of the preliminary inquiry at the request of the defence had no
    real effect on the timing of the commencement of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the timing of the re-election, which occurred after the date on
    which the preliminary inquiry was scheduled to proceed, this case should be
    treated as one in which the proceedings travelled through two levels of court. 
    This seven-month period should be attributed to scheduling demands and,
    consequently, to institutional delay.  A seven-month delay in the trial court
    is within the guidelines set down in <i>Morin</i>.  I would add that the attribution
    of this seven-month period as institutional delay is potentially unduly favourable
    to the respondent in that it assumes that the October dates were the first
    available dates for trial.  The record is silent on this issue.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only period of delay potentially referable to discussions concerning
    the audit is the five-month period between late-January 2006 and mid-June 2006. 
    As of late January, the Crown had decided it needed a new forensic audit. 
    Clearly, time would be needed to prepare that audit.  To the extent that the
    preparation of the audit delayed the proceedings, that delay is properly
    attributable to the Crown.  It is fair to infer that but for the need to
    prepare a second audit the parties would have been in a position to set a
    preliminary inquiry date before June of 2006. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think, however, that it would be fair to attribute the entire five
    months to the Crown.  It was appropriate, especially given the position of the
    defence, that counsel try to reach some consensus as to the audit’s nature and
    scope before proceeding with it.  Consultation necessarily meant some delay in
    finalizing the accountants’ retainer.  Some part of the five months should be
    attributable to the time relating to those consultations.  While I appreciate
    that any allocation must be somewhat arbitrary, I think it is fair to allocate
    two of the five months to the consultations.  The other three months should be
    allocated to the Crown.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the total elapsed time, the explanations for the
    various delays, the relative complexity of the case and the public interest in
    a trial on the merits, but also bearing in mind the allegations of prejudice
    put forward on behalf of the respondent, I do not think that the respondent has
    made out a violation of s. 11(b).  </p>
  <h2>IV.      THE APPELLATE DELAY</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent on appeal submits that even if the court is
    satisfied that the trial judge erred in entering a stay, because of the time
    that has elapsed while the Crown’s appeal was outstanding, it should decline to
    order a new trial.  This appeal was launched some two-and-a-half years ago. 
    Counsel for the respondent submits that the Crown had an obligation to pursue
    its appeal with due diligence, but instead allowed months, if not years, to go
    by without making any progress on the appeal.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel on appeal offered an explanation in his oral submissions
    for some of the delay.  That explanation relates primarily to the availability
    of transcripts.  However, even if this explanation is accepted at face value,
    this appeal went unperfected for no good reason for almost a year.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 11(b) does not apply to appeals.  Delays on appeal give rise to
    a <i>Charter</i> remedy only if those delays would undermine the fairness of a
    subsequent trial:  <i>R. v. Potvin</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p. 915.  The
    respondent has not attempted to draw any connection between the appellate delay
    and his ability to obtain a fair trial should this court order a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the errors made on the motion to stay proceedings
    require that the stay be set aside and a new trial ordered.  I stress, however,
    that this court expects the Crown to pursue its appeals with due diligence and
    in accordance with the rules.  The Crown has to do better than it did in this
    case.  Respondents who find themselves adversely affected by Crown
    foot-dragging on appeals should avail themselves of the various procedures
    available to bring those delays to the attention of the court.  This court has
    the power to dismiss appeals as abandoned if they are not pursued in accordance
    with the rules.    </p>
  <h2>V.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the stay and direct a new trial.</p>
