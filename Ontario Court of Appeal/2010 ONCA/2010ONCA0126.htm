  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the Superior Court of Justice have jurisdiction to
    bifurcate the trial of liability and damages issues where there is a valid jury
    notice in place and the parties do not consent?  That is the fundamental question raised on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For quite some time now, it has been accepted that the
    answer in Ontario was “no.”  We are now
    asked to reconsider, or to re-affirm, that understanding, at least for the
    period prior to January 1, 2010 – the effective date of new rule 6.1.01, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With the consent of the parties, the court may
    order a separate hearing on one or more issues in a proceeding, including
    separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p>            <u>The
    Accident</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Kovach plaintiffs and the Linn defendants are
    parties to an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on
    Halloween in 1999.  The action is
    scheduled to be heard by a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pauline Kovach was out “trick or treating” that evening
    with her two children, Andrew and Sarah, and two of her nephews.  She reversed her van out of a private
    driveway onto a public road where her van collided with a pickup truck operated
    by Mackenzie Linn and owned by Barry Linn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there were other injuries, Andrew – eight
    years old at the time – suffered a serious brain injury and pelvic fractures in
    the crash.  The parties agree that his
    impairments are “catastrophic”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it happens, Aviva Canada Inc. insured both the
    Kovach and Linn vehicles under separate and unrelated policies.  Each policy has third party liability limits
    of $1 million.  It is quite likely that Andrew’<span
lang=EN-US>s</span> damages, if the plaintiffs
    are successful, will exceed the limits of both policies.  His claim is for $11.5 million.  If the Linn defendants are found to be even 1%
    liable, he will have access to coverage under both policies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the Kovach plaintiffs and the Linn defendants have
    served jury notices.  The Linn defendants
    seek to have the trial of the liability and damages issues bifurcated,
    however.  They propose that the trials of
    these issues be dealt with by different juries.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Proceedings</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 26, 2007, Master Egan dismissed the Linns’
    motion to bifurcate the action.  She held
    that she was bound by the decisions of the Divisional Court in <i>Duffy v. Gillespie</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 443,
    and <i>Carreiro (Litigation Guardian) v.
    Flynn </i>(2005), 195 O.A.C. 315, and had no jurisdiction to make such an order
    absent the consent of the parties.  Those
    decisions, in turn, relied upon the authority of this Court in <i>Elcano Acceptance Ltd. v. Richmond,
    Richmond, Stambler &amp; Mills</i> (1986), 55 O.R. (2d) 56 and on another
    decision of the Divisional Court in <i>Shepley
    v. Libby McNeil &amp; Libby of Canada Ltd.</i> (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 354.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will return to a discussion of these authorities
    later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Master Egan did not consider whether, if there were
    jurisdiction, bifurcation would have been appropriate in the circumstances of
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 2, 2008, Justice Chapnik set aside the Order of
    Master Egan.  She concluded that, on a
    close reading, <i>Shepley</i> did not stand
    for the proposition that the court lacks jurisdiction to bifurcate a trial
    where one party has served a jury notice, absent consent, and that the
    reference to <i>Shepley</i> in <i>Elcano</i> was <i>obiter</i>.  Relying on the
    court’s inherent jurisdiction to control its own process and the purposive
    direction in case management rule 77.02 encouraging expeditious and less costly
    proceedings, she was satisfied that the Master had jurisdiction to make such an
    order.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chapnik J. was also satisfied that bifurcation was
    appropriate on the facts of this case because the liability issue was completely
    distinct from the damages issues, which were more complex.  As well, a finding in the Linns’ favour would
    render the damages trial unnecessary.  She therefore concluded that the moving parties had met the onus of
    establishing a “clear benefit in terms of time and expense”, shifting the onus
    of showing a “real prejudice” outweighing the expediency of bifurcation to the
    Kovachs, which they had not done: see <i>General
    Refractories Co. of Canada v. Venturedyne Ltd.</i>, 6 C.P.C. (5th) 329 (Ont.
    S.C.) and <i>Bourne v. Saunby</i>, 23 C.P.C.
    (3d) 333 (Ont. Ct. J.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lax J. granted leave to appeal and, on January 15, <span
class=GramE>2009,</span> the Divisional Court (Carnwath, Swinton and Bellamy
    JJ.) allowed the appeal, set aside the Order of Chapnik&nbsp;J. and restored
    the Order of Master Egan.  The Court held
    that the Master was correct in concluding that she was bound by the decisions
    in <i>Duffy</i> and <i>Carreiro</i> and that there was no good reason to depart from the
    decision of other panels of the Divisional Court: the law in Ontario is that a
    jury trial cannot be bifurcated if one party objects.   The Court also concluded that Chapnik J. had
    applied an incorrect test in evaluating the appropriateness of bifurcation on
    the facts.  The power to bifurcate is a
    “narrowly circumscribed power” to be exercised only in the “clearest cases”.  This was not one of those exceptional cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 23, 2009, this Court granted leave to appeal
    from the decision of the Divisional Court.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>            <u>Jurisdiction to Bifurcate an
    Action Where a Jury Notice Has Been Served</u></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to January 1, 2010, <span class=GramE>neither the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.43, nor the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i></span> expressly conferred the power to bifurcate a civil trial.  As Justice Morden noted at p. 59 in <i>Elcano</i>, however, this fact “does not …
    mean that [the power to bifurcate] may not be part of the inherent jurisdiction
    of the court”.  Indeed, as he said, the
    jurisprudence accepts that the power exists on this basis, to be exercised with
    caution, but in the interests of justice.  But he added a clarification – the statement that underlies the debate
    on this appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It has been held that the power may not be
    exercised where one of the parties has served a jury notice: <i>Shepley v. Libby McNeil &amp; Libby of
    Canada Ltd; Clifford McKenzie et al., Third Parties</i> (1979), 23 O.R. (2d)
    354, 9 C.P.C. 201.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rightly or wrongly, jury cases have long been
    considered to provide an exception to the court’s power to split a trial based
    on its inherent jurisdiction.  The power
    was not to be exercised in such cases.  On behalf of the appellants, Mr. Rachlin argues that the jurisprudence
    on which this principle is based has been misunderstood and misapplied, and
    that it does not support the jury exception proposition.  Moreover, he submits, Justice Morden’s
    exclusion of jury trials from the reach of inherent jurisdiction in <i>Elcano</i> – based on <i>Shepley</i> – was <i>obiter dicta</i>,
    and is therefore not binding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Justice Morden’s comment in <i>Elcano</i> is not <i>obiter dicta</i>,
    in my view.  An expert in procedural
    matters, Justice Morden was not given to discursive comments.  It is true that <i>Elcano</i> was not a jury case.  Having concluded that the court’s inherent jurisdiction empowered it to
    bifurcate a trial in appropriate circumstances, however, it was necessary for
    him to state the exception in order to make the proposition he was enunciating
    accurate.  This does not make the caveat
    he expressed <i>obiter</i>; it was essential
    to his reasoning process, and therefore part of the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the <i>Shepley</i> decision does stand for the proposition for which it was cited.  At p. 355, the Divisional Court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assuming, without
    deciding, that a Judge sitting in Motions Court has the authority under the
    Rules or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to direct the trial of this
    issue at this stage of the proceedings, in our opinion he does not have
    jurisdiction to sever an issue of fact or mixed fact and law … for
    determination before trial where there is a valid jury notice subsisting.  The plaintiff, having properly served the
    jury notice, has a right which is conferred by s. 62(1) of the <i>Judicature Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 228 [the
    old equivalent of what is now s. 108(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>] to have all the issues of fact tried by a
    jury subject only to the jury notice being struck out by a Judge, or subject to
    the discretion of the Judge at trial (s. 62(3)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Shepley</i>,
    the motion judge relied on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to sever a
    limitation issue for determination prior to the pending jury trial.  For the reasons outlined above, the
    Divisional Court held that he could not.  Mr. Rachlin contends that <i>Shepley</i> does not stand for the proposition that a jury matter may never be severed, but
    rather for the proposition that bifurcation is inappropriate where the result
    will deprive a party of the right to have all issues raised determined by a
    jury (the plaintiff in <i>Shepley</i> had
    been deprived of his right to have the limitation issue decided by a
    jury).  Here, the appellants argue, they
    do not seek to deny the respondents of the right to trial by jury; at most, the
    order sought would require separate trials of liability and damages by <i>different</i> juries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Shepley</i> may indeed
    stand for the proposition that it is <i>inappropriate</i> to split a trial where a party will be deprived of the right to have factual
    issues determined by a jury.  However,
    the <i>ratio</i> of the case is that the
    court lacks <i>jurisdiction</i> to do so in
    a jury case.  The plaintiff in <i>Shepley</i> argued <i>in the alternative</i> that, if it had the jurisdiction to do so, “the
    Court <i>ought not to </i>have made the
    order because it thereby deprive[d] the plaintiff of his right to have that
    issue tried by a jury...” (<span class=GramE>emphasis</span> added).  Thus, the argument only arose in that case if
    the court decided there was jurisdiction to make the bifurcation order in the
    first place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Shepley</i> is
    the lynch-pin in the appellants’ analysis because the attempt to undermine the
    authority of <i>Elcano</i> – and of <i>Duffy</i> and <i>Carreiro</i> in the Divisional Court, which are both founded on <i>Elcano </i>and<i> Shepley</i> – depends upon the conclusion that <i>Shepley</i> has been misunderstood and misapplied.  But it has not been misunderstood and
    misapplied, in my view.  Given the
    foregoing analysis, the appellants’ attempts to distinguish the line of
    jurisprudence upholding the proposition that jury trials may not be split, in
    the absence of consent, fall away.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a further basis upon which the appellants’
    position founders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a well-entrenched principle in Ontario that a
    litigant has the inherent right to have the issues of fact or of mixed fact and
    law decided by a jury (except in cases where the right has been taken away by
    statute).  This principle is embodied in
    subsection 108(1) of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In an action in the Superior Court of Justice that
    is not in the Small Claims Court, a party may require that the issues of fact
    be tried or the damages assessed, or both, by a jury, unless otherwise
    provided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The language of s. 108(1) provides legislative support
    for the notion that a party may require the issues to be tried by a single
    jury, i.e., “by <u>a</u> jury.”  Subsection 108(3) provides an exception to this principle by stipulating
    that the court may order issues of fact to be tried, or damages assessed, or
    both, by a judge alone.  But – contrary
    to the appellants’ argument – s. 108(1) leaves no legislative “gap” to be
    filled by the exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction: see <i>Re Stelco Inc.</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 5
    (C.A.), at para. 35.  This conclusion is
    reinforced by the decision in <i>Shepley</i> where, on the basis of the substantially identical predecessor of s. 108(1),<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> the Divisional Court held that there is “[no] jurisdiction to sever an issue of
    fact, or mixed fact and law … for determination before trial where there is a valid
    jury notice subsisting.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I do not accept the appellants’ submission
    that the word “<u>a</u>” jury in s.&nbsp;108(1) should be interpreted as “<u>any</u>”
    jury.  Had the legislature intended such
    a marked departure from the normal and long-standing practice of trials by “a”
    judge or “a” jury, it would have said so by using the words “trial by any jury”
    or, simply, “trial by jury.”  It did not
    do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To interpret s. 108(1) in a fashion that permits
    the trial of different issues by different juries – absent consent – would also
    be inconsistent with the well-entrenched principle that once a trier of fact is
    seized of an action, it remains seized of it until judgment is pronounced.  The following passage from the decision of
    Martin J.P.C. in <i><span lang=EN-US>The “Leonor”</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, [1917] 3 W.W.R. 861, at p. 871 – cited with
    approval in <i>Re Regina and Breckner</i> (1983),
    6 C.C.C. (3d) 42 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 52 – captures this principle well:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Once a Judge is so seized of a cause or motion he
    is the sole and only tribunal which can exercise jurisdiction over it (unless
    prohibited by a Higher Court) and from the time he takes his seat upon the
    bench at the beginning of the hearing till he leaves it after judgment is
    pronounced, no other Judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction can either by physical
    force or by writing under his hand usurp his functions or eject him from his
    seat, or constitute another forum to which the parties may lawfully resort,
    which is simply usurpation and ejection in another form.</span>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juries are judges of the facts, and the same principle
    applies once a matter has been submitted to the jury for determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Rachlin asks why in principle, if there is inherent
    jurisdiction to bifurcate in judge alone cases, or as between a judge and jury,
    it should be different for jury cases (acknowledging that there may be
    differences in the factors to be considered in determining whether to bifurcate
    or not in the different types of cases).  He submits that to permit bifurcation of issues into different jury
    trials – even with different juries – does not deprive a litigant of the right
    to have all issues of fact or of mixed fact and law determined by a jury – the
    impediment identified in <i>Shepley</i>.  Furthermore, it is consistent with modern
    principles of case management, as expressed in former rule 77.02, and various
    judicial pronouncements about the need for courts to control their own
    processes and the need to conserve scarce public resources:  see, for example, <i>Ashmore v. Corp. of Lloyd’s</i>, [1992] 2 All E.R. 486 (H.L.); <i>General Refractories</i> at paras. 12-13; <i>Woodglen &amp; Co. v. Owens</i>, [1995] O.J.
    No. 1360, at paras. 10-13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are a number of answers to this hypothetical
    question.  For one, when issues are
    separated in a judge alone trial, it is the same judge – absent consent to the
    contrary – who deals with all the issues.  He or she simply does so at different times.  This is because of the principle of seizure
    discussed above.  For another, s. 108(3) of
    the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> provides
    specific statutory authority in a jury case for issues to be removed from the
    jury to be tried by judge alone.  No such
    authority exists for the splitting of issues to be tried by two or more juries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, neither the provisions of former rule
    77.02 nor the <i>Ashmore</i> line of
    jurisprudence assists the appellants in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 77.02 stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The purpose of this Rule is to establish a case
    management system throughout Ontario that reduces unnecessary cost and delay in
    civil litigation, facilitates early and fair settlements and brings proceedings
    expeditiously to a just determination while allowing sufficient time for the
    conduct of the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This rule accurately reflects an important philosophy
    underpinning the introduction of case management in Ontario: the expeditious,
    but just and less costly, determination of case managed civil proceedings.  However, bifurcation is broader than case
    management, and there is nothing in former Rule 77 – the case management rule –
    that touches on the severance of issues in an action for separate trials.  Indeed, when the Rules Committee enacted the
    new rule governing separate hearings, it placed it in a part of the rules far
    removed from case management.  Rule
    6.1.01 – effective January 1, 2010 – is the first time a rule speaking to
    bifurcation has been promulgated.  It
    signals that, in the opinion of the Rules Committee at least, the bifurcation
    of a trial, jury or non-jury, is not generally a good idea unless the parties
    consent.  To repeat, rule 6.1.01 states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With the consent of the parties, the court may
    order a separate hearing on one or more issues in a proceeding, including
    separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This new rule may well permit the bifurcation of issues
    of fact or of mixed fact and law even where a jury notice has been filed, <i>where the parties consent</i>, thus
    surmounting the jurisdictional impediments previously in place.  But the new rule does not apply to the case at
    bar.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ashmore</i>,
    Lord Roskill made the following oft-cited remark, at p. 488:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court of Appeal appear to have taken the view
    that the plaintiffs were entitled as of right to have their case tried to
    conclusion in such manner as they thought fit and if necessary after all the
    evidence on both sides had been adduced.  With great respect, like my noble and learned friend, I emphatically
    disagree. In the Commercial Court and indeed in any trial court it is the trial
    judge who has control of the proceedings.  It is part of his duty to identify the crucial issues and to see they
    are tried as expeditiously and as inexpensively as possible.  It is the duty of the advisers of the parties
    to assist the trial judge in carrying out his duty.  Litigants are not entitled to the
    uncontrolled use of a trial judge’s time.  Other litigants await their turn.  Litigants are only entitled to so much of the trial judge’s time as is
    necessary for the proper determination of the relevant issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without in any way detracting from the force of Lord
    Roskill’s reflections, however, I make the following observations.  First, <i>Ashmore</i> was a commercial case and did not involve the question of severing issues in a proceeding
    (jury or non-jury).  Secondly, I agree
    with the statement of E. Macdonald J. in <i>Woodglen</i>,
    at para. 11, concerning the <i>Ashmore</i> comment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Opposite this objective, I am mindful of the very
    persuasive argument … that this objective should not compromise or prejudice
    either party to the litigation by the making of orders such as the one sought
    today by the plaintiffs.  I agree that,
    as a general proposition, convenience, the saving of time and the saving of
    costs for the litigants, as well as for the State, are secondary to the
    overriding concern that no party should be prejudiced as the result of an order
    such as the one sought today by the plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key is prejudice to the rights of a party in the
    litigation.  In the absence of statutory
    or rules-based authority to do so, there are sound reasons in principle for
    adopting the view that a court does not have jurisdiction to bifurcate issues
    in a jury trial – or, to put it in the words of Justice Morden in <i>Elcano </i>– “that the power <i>may not be exercised</i> where one of the
    parties has served a jury notice.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, there is the familiar injunction in s. 138 of
    the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> that, as
    far as possible, multiplicity of proceedings is to be avoided.  Since they do not want to transgress the
    right to have one’s issues tried by a jury, the appellants assert that the
    issues in a bifurcated jury trial can be tried by two (or more) juries.  Mr. Rachlin was not able to refer us to a single
    case where that had ever been done, however, and the implications inherent in
    such an order are disquieting.  Multiple
    appeals in the same action, with the delays and substantial costs accompanying
    them?  Multiple juries, with the
    possibility of inconsistent findings between them?  Questions about two triers of fact being
    “seized” of the same action?  As a
    practical matter, the ability of a judge at the motion stage to determine
    whether there will be no overlap on the evidence relating to both liability and
    damages at <span class=GramE>trial,</span> is something that is almost
    impossible to predict accurately.  The
    safer approach – for which the Rules Committee has now opted – is not to permit
    bifurcation in jury cases unless there is consent.  Where there is consent, one party freely
    gives up its right to have the issues tried by a single jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Related to these concerns is the long-ago expressed
    judicial admonition of Meredith C.J. in <i>Waller
    v. Independent Order of Foresters</i> (1905), 5 O.W.R. 421 (Div.&nbsp;Ct.), at
    p. 422, that bears repeating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Experience has shewn that seldom, if ever, is any
    advantage gained by trying some of the issues before the trial of the others is
    entered upon...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This statement was cited with approval in <i>Elcano</i>, at p. 59, and more recently, it
    has been reiterated at the trial level by Shaughnessy J – a former Regional
    Senior Justice familiar with the challenges of allocating judicial resources –
    in <i>Blanchette v. Jody Squires</i>, 76
    C.C.L.I. (4th) 304 (Ont. S.C.), at paras. 23-24. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of the considerations I have touched on may
    not go directly to jurisdiction.  They
    are more clearly tied to the <i>appropriateness</i> of granting a bifurcation order in particular circumstances – which this Court
    has said in <i>Elcano</i>, at p. 59,<i> </i>is only to be done “in the clearest
    cases.”   Nonetheless, they underscore
    the rationale behind the interpretation I have given to s. 108(1) above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The practice in Ontario has long been understood to
    preclude the bifurcation of trials where a jury notice has been served, in the
    absence of consent.  To reverse that
    practice, as the appellants seek, would be a major change in the law.  In Ontario, it is primarily the role of the
    Rules Committee to develop new rules respecting the practice and procedure in
    civil matters.  In doing so, it takes into
    account the needs of the system viewed through the experience of judges and
    practitioners across the province.   Much
    better that a stark change in practice, such as that proposed by the appellants
    – reversing a long-standing and fundamental right to trial by a single jury –
    be left to the legislature or the Rules Committee – a responsibility that the
    Rules Committee has now fulfilled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Appropriate Test for Bifurcation</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of my conclusion that the court did not have
    jurisdiction to order the bifurcated trial of issues sought by the appellants
    in this case, it is unnecessary to consider whether Chapnik J. erred in
    applying a “clear benefit of time and expense” test, as opposed to a “clearest
    of cases” test, and I decline to do so.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
