  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With leave, the appellant appeals the order that
    electronic images of the hard drives of two computers seized from her be sent
    to France.  Both computers were seized
    pursuant to warrants issued under s. 12 of the <i>Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 c. 30,
    s. 12(1).  The appellant invites this
    court to conclude that the warrants could not have been properly issued,
    arguing that in two ways they were not supported by reasonable and probable
    grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she says that there were insufficient grounds to
    find that Mr. Diab was communicating via email with other suspects in the plot
    to blow up a Paris synagogue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.  The appellant concedes for the purposes of this appeal that there was
    evidence that her common-law spouse, Mr. Diab, was part of the terrorist
    plot.  There was evidence that members of
    terrorist cells do communicate with each other by email.  The evidence also shows that after Mr. Diab
    became aware of newspaper articles discussing his alleged role in the plot,
    there was a spike in his communications with his ex-wife who was associated
    with the terrorist group responsible for the attack, and that, at the same time
    he was taking steps to have some of  his
    communications go undetected.  Taken
    together, this would allow the issuing judge to come to the conclusion that
    there is a practical and reasonable probability that Mr. Diab was in
    communication by email with other members of the terrorist plot.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant says that there were insufficient
    grounds to infer that Mr. Diab may have been communicating via the appellant’s
    two computers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again we disagree.  The evidence is that Mr. Diab and the appellant lived together at the
    residence from where the laptop was seized, that they both taught at a
    university where the second computer was, that the appellant had an office in a
    building there, that Mr. Diab had been seen leaving that building, and that he
    appeared to be trying to disguise his communications by using devices (pay telephones),
    other than his own.  This provides a
    sufficient basis for the issuing judge to have concluded that there is a
    reasonable probability that Mr. Diab was using these two computers to email
    others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal therefore fails.  We need not address the question of remedy.</p>
