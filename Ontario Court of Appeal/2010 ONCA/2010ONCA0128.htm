  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The adjournment
    request</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeared today and, on learning that duty
    counsel who were present were unavailable to assist him due to a conflict,
    requested that the hearing of his s. 684 application be adjourned to April 21,
    2010 to permit him to obtain assistance of other duty counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel vigorously opposed the requested
    adjournment.  She informed the court of
    her understanding, based on her communications with the head of the duty
    counsel program, that duty counsel would be unable to assist the appellant with
    his s. 684 application.  By
    correspondence to him in January 2010, Crown counsel so informed the appellant
    and, in accordance with this court’s endorsement dated November 17, 2009,
    confirmed to him that the argument of his s. 684 application was to proceed on
    this date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The requested adjournment is denied.  This matter has been pending for a lengthy
    period of time.  The November 17, 2009
    endorsement of this court made it clear, in blunt and unambiguous terms, that
    the argument of the appellant’s s. 684 application was to proceed on this date
    “whether or not duty counsel is available to provide him with assistance”.  Crown counsel quoted from this direction in
    her January 2010 correspondence to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, there can be no doubt that the appellant
    had ample advance notice that his s. 684 application was to be argued today,
    even if duty counsel was not available to assist him.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The s. 684
    application</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes an application pursuant to s. 684
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for funding to
    provide legal assistance for his appeal from his conviction for first degree
    murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test on a s. 684 application was set out by this
    court in <i>R. v. Bernardo</i> (1997), 121
    C.C.C. (3d) 123 at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, counsel must be appointed where an accused
    cannot effectively present his or her appeal without the help of a lawyer.  Second, counsel must be appointed where the
    court cannot properly decide the appeal without the assistance of counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the record before us and the oral
    submissions of the appellant, the appellant has not established either of these
    criteria.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appeal involves the most serious criminal
    offence, with particularly serious consequences for the appellant (life
    imprisonment with no chance of parole for 25 years), we cannot say that the
    appellant is incapable of effectively presenting his appeal without the
    assistance of counsel.  The appellant is
    a well-educated man with long experience as a police officer in the criminal
    justice system.  He presented an
    organized argument on this application, including references to the leading
    authority and test on a s. 684 application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do we think that it would be impossible or even
    difficult for this court to decide the appeal without the assistance of
    counsel.  Although the appellant has
    raised 35 possible grounds of appeal, there is nothing unusual or unduly
    complex about these grounds.  A panel of
    this court should have little difficulty understanding and resolving the
    various issues raised by the appellant.  Moreover, it is probable that the issues can easily be reduced to a
    small number of central ones.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raised a concern that because he is being
    held in a segregated unit he would not have access to the prison legal library
    in order to prepare for his appeal.  The
    information the Crown obtained confirmed that a prisoner in segregation cannot
    use the library in the normal course; however, the library will provide legal
    materials to the appellant in his cell on request to the head librarian.  In the circumstances, we direct that the
    appellant be provided ongoing access in his cell to the legal materials in the
    institution’s library on his request to the head librarian.  Moreover, we note that Ms. Fairburn has
    indicated that, if requested, she is prepared to provide assistance to the
    appellant in accessing relevant legal materials.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application is dismissed.</p>
