  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, <span class=SpellE>Dayon</span> Flowers,
    and his co-accused, Dwight <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> – young men of 22
    and 20 years at the time – participated in a series of 15 consecutive
    convenience store robberies between mid-August and mid-November, 2006.  Each robbery was characterized by some form
    of gratuitous violence and by the use of either a prohibited sawed-off shotgun
    or a handgun to intimidate the store-worker victims and render them compliant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Flowers pleaded guilty to 8 counts of armed robbery
    (4 in common with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span>) along with another
    related weapons offence.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> also pled guilty to 8 counts of robbery (including
    the 4 in common with Mr. Flowers) and to an additional charge of aggravated
    assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Primarily it was Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> who personally wielded the weapons during the robberies, but we note that the
    weapons offence to which Mr. Flowers also pleaded guilty was for breach of a
    mandatory weapons prohibition order.  He
    must at least have been carrying a weapon during the incidents, therefore.  It is part of the admitted facts as well that
    he instructed Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> at one point to shoot a
    clerk who was <span class=GramE>lying</span> on the ground – part of the
    intimidation techniques, apparently.  Fortunately, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed a global sentence of 10 years
    imprisonment, less 4 years’ credit for pre-trial custody, on Mr. Flowers for
    the robbery convictions.  He imposed a
    one-year consecutive sentence on the plea to breach of a mandatory weapons
    prohibition order, but adjusted the robbery sentences downwards somewhat to
    maintain a global sentence of 10 years on totality principles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> received a
    sentence of 8 years for the robberies, less time served, and an additional 2
    years for the aggravated assault, for a global sentence of 10 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While not arguing strenuously that 10 years was an
    inappropriate sentence for Mr. Flowers in the circumstances, Ms. Davies submits
    on his behalf that the trial judge  erred
    by failing to apply the principle of parity properly.  She relies particularly on the passage in his
    reasons where he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the circumstances, given Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon’s</span> central role in these multiple violent crimes, I am not inclined to apply any
    significant variance in sentence as between the accused.  Where there may be some adjustment is in the
    total sentence following the disposition to be imposed in relation to the
    aggravated assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> who
    pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault, yet he received the lesser sentence
    for the robberies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if it were an error, on pure parity principles,
    not to impose equal sentences for the robberies – given the trial judge’s
    findings above – we would not impose a different sentence on Mr. Flowers than
    the 10 years chosen by the trial judge in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These were particularly egregious, violent and callous
    crimes, carried out in a pre-meditated and common manner over a period of several
    months.  Whether Mr. Flowers himself
    wielded the guns is not particularly significant in our view.  He knew very well that guns and intimidation
    would be used during the commission of the crimes and, in fact – as noted above
    – he encouraged that conduct and participated in it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A sentence of 10 years’ incarceration was a perfectly
    fit sentence to impose.  If Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Dilleon’s</span> sentence was somewhat light, Mr. Flowers is not automatically
    entitled to benefit from Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon’s</span> good fortune: see <i>R v. Douglas</i> (1996) O.A.C. 224, at
    para. 9.  <span class=GramE>In</span> <i>R v. <span class=SpellE>Issa</span> (T.)</i> (1992), 57 O.A.C. 253, this Court stated the following with respect to the
    principle of parity:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So long as sentencing remains an
    individual process there may be sentences meted out to offenders for
    participation in the same offence which are justifiably disparate.  [We] think that Clayton Ruby’s statement in
    Sentencing (3<sup>rd</sup> Ed. 1987), at p. 29 is correct, that the rule
    against unreasonable disparity in sentencing ‘does not require equal sentences,
    but only understandable sentences when examined together.’ [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Gale C.J.O<span class=GramE>.,</span> recognized that a sting of injustice might follow in some cases and the court
    should act on it.  In R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Dawdy</span> (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 477 (Ont. C.A.) at 478-479, he
    said:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>While we are not bound to sentence <span
class=SpellE>Dawdy</span> by reference to Bush’s sentence, we do think that the
    sentence should not be so disparate as to cause bitterness or resentment on the
    part of <span class=SpellE>Dawdy</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the question is whether the disparity in
    sentences – to the extent there was one – works an injustice on Mr.
    Flowers.  In our view, it does not.  The differences are understandable on the
    facts, and we can see no basis upon which Mr. Flowers could justifiably feel
    bitterness or resentment as a result.  There were significant differences between the circumstances of these
    young men that in themselves would justify discrete sentences.  Mr. Flowers had a lengthy criminal record
    (including offences of violence).  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> did not.  Mr.
    Flowers was on probation at the time he participated in this run of
    robberies.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> was not (although he was on bail for the aggravated assault offence at the time
    some of the robberies were committed).  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dilleon</span> had better prospects of
    rehabilitation, in the trial judge’s view.  The trial judge concluded that Mr. Flowers was “criminally inclined,
    prone to violence and likely incorrigible,” although he did not rule out all
    prospects of rehabilitation (and we commend Mr. Flowers for the efforts he
    appears to be making to turn himself around since these convictions).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, however, we would not
    interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge.  Leave to appeal sentence is therefore
    granted, but the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</p>
