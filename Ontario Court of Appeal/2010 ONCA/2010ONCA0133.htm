  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was charged with one count of sexual
    assault in relation to the complainant K.B., a 19-year-old developmentally
    challenged woman with the cognitive capabilities of a three to six-year-old
    child.  The offence was alleged to have
    occurred when the respondent cohabited with K.B.s mother, Mrs. B.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was tried by McKinnon J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.  The trial judge acquitted the respondent.  The Crown appeals, essentially on two
    grounds: first, that the trial judge erred by ruling that K.B. did not have
    testimonial competence under s. 16 of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (the <i>CEA</i>);
    and second, that the trial judge erred in excluding K.B.s hearsay statements
    to her school teacher and a police officer.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent lived with the B family  Mrs. B, K.B.
    and her younger sister J.B.  in their Ottawa home from 2000 to 2004.  The respondent and K.B. were very close.  In conversations with her school teacher,
    Heather White, K.B. was very complimentary about the respondent.  After the respondent moved out of the B home,
    K.B. told her teacher that she missed him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, K.B. also told Ms. White about a hugging
    game she and the respondent played together.  In the game, according to K.B., the respondent rubbed her breasts,
    buttocks and genitals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. White immediately informed the school principal of
    K.B.s statements and the police were contacted.  On May 3, 2005, K.B. was interviewed by
    Sergeant David Christie.  Her statement,
    approximately 20 minutes in duration, was recorded.  When Sergeant Christie asked K.B. about
    touching, she replied, He touched my body, and when asked where she had been
    touched, K.B. touched her breasts, vaginal area and buttocks.  When asked if this happened once or more than
    once, K.B. answered all the time.  When
    asked if the respondent touched her breasts, she answered, Yeah, and when
    asked whether he touched over top of [her] pyjamas, she replied
    underneath.  When asked how, she
    responded from underneath the pyjamas.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the preliminary inquiry on June 29, 2006, K.B. was
    found to be a competent witness.  Pursuant to s. 715.2 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, her videotaped statement to police was admitted as her examination in
    chief and she was cross-examined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the trial, the issue of K.B.s competence to testify
    came up again under s. 16 of the <i>CEA</i>,
    which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span lang=EN>16. </span></b><span
lang=EN>(1) If a
    proposed witness is a person of fourteen years of age or older whose mental
    capacity is challenged, the court shall, before permitting the person to give
    evidence, conduct an inquiry to determine </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(<i>a</i>) whether the
    person understands the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(<i>b</i>) whether the
    person is able to communicate the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(2) A person referred to in subsection (1) who understands the nature of
    an oath or a solemn affirmation and is able to communicate the evidence shall
    testify under oath or solemn affirmation. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(3) A person referred to in subsection (1) who does
    not understand the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation but is able to
    communicate the evidence may, notwithstanding any provision of any Act
    requiring an oath or a solemn affirmation, testify on promising to tell the
    truth. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(4) A person referred to in subsection (1) who
    neither understands the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation nor is able
    to communicate the evidence shall not testify. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN> (5) A party
    who challenges the mental capacity of a proposed witness of fourteen years of
    age or more has the burden of satisfying the court that there is an issue as to

    affirmation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to ss. 486.1 and 486.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, K.B.s examination was
    conducted outside the courtroom, in the presence of a support worker, and
    transmitted by way of closed circuit television.  K.B. was asked questions by Crown counsel,
    defence counsel and the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Dr. Varan Kunjukrishnan was qualified to
    give opinion evidence with respect to K.B.s cognitive capacity.  His opinion was based on his review of K.B.s
    school and medical records and his observation of her during the competence <i>voir dire</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Kunjukrishnan testified that K.B.s level of
    intellectual functioning was lower than the first percentile.  Her social functioning was equivalent to that
    of a three to six-year-old child.  K.B.s
    medical reports indicated a low frustration tolerance, meaning that she tends
    to respond impulsively and aggressively to things she does not comprehend.  His opinion, after watching K.B. throughout
    the <i>voir dire</i>, was that K.B. has
    serious difficulty in differentiating the concept of truth and lie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge determined that K.B. was not competent
    to testify.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having questioned [K.B.] at length I am fully
    satisfied that [K.B.] has not satisfied the prerequisite that she understands
    the duty to speak the truth.  She cannot
    communicate what truth involves or what a lie involves, or what consequences
    result from truth or lies, and in such circumstances, quite independent of
    Doctor Kunjukrishnan, I am not satisfied that she can be permitted to testify
    under a promise to tell the truth.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I say this is a criminal trial involving
    criminal charges and while every effort should be brought to bear to
    accommodate witnesses with disabilities, at the end of the day the Court has an
    obligation to ensure that evidence that is going to be used in an attempt to
    convict an individual must meet the requirements of the law, and in this case
    unfortunately [K.B.] cannot be permitted to give evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the trial judges disqualification of K.B. as
    a witness, the Crown applied to admit her hearsay statements to the police and
    to her teacher.  At the conclusion of a <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge ruled that
    the statements were inadmissible.  He
    observed that there are numerous contradictions within the various interviews
    of [K.B.] and with other evidence led on the <i>voir dire</i>.  He also found
    that [w]hat the Crown purports to be confirmatory evidence is either ambiguous
    or itself unreliable.  He concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case at bar, I am persuaded that threshold
    reliability must have some regard to an assessment of whether the statement is
    true or not, and whether any adequate substitutes exist for testing the
    evidence.  I have concerns regarding the
    truth of the statement and I find that there are no adequate substitutes for
    testing [K.B.]s evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am convinced that to admit [K.B.]s statement for
    its truth would deprive the court of any reliable method of testing its
    truth.  Phrased another way, the evidence
    is unreliable, and its admission would seriously compromise the accuseds right
    to a fair trial.  Moreover, the
    prejudicial effect of its admission would outweigh its probative value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial continued with testimony from K.B.s sister
    J.B., who testified that she observed the respondent fondle K.B.s breasts
    while in K.B.s bedroom watching television.  In addition, the Crown introduced evidence of Polaroid photographs found
    in the respondents possession that depicted K.B. exhibiting her bare breasts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his decision, the trial judge rejected J.B.s
    testimony because of her professed animus against the accused, her professed
    hatred of her mother and what I construe to be troubling inconsistencies in her
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the photograph, the trial judge
    recorded the respondents explanation that K.B. flashed him just as he was
    taking her picture.  He then reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[S]uch evidence could lead to a suggestion that the
    accused harboured a sexual interest in [K.B.].  At the same time, his explanation might constitute the truth, namely
    that the photo was innocently taken.  In
    the end  I would conclude that the photo is insufficient to provide
    confirmatory evidence of a sexual assault.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown raises two issues on the appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1) Did the trial
    judge err by holding that K.B. was not a competent witness within the meaning
    of s. 16 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>  (2)
    Did the trial judge err by excluding K.B.s hearsay statements?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The
    complainants competence to testify</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown makes a two-pronged challenge to the trial
    judges ruling that K.B. was not competent.  First, the Crown contends that the trial judge made errors in applying
    the existing jurisprudential standard for determining competence under s. 16(3)
    of the <i>CEA</i>, both by applying too high
    a standard in assessing K.B.s testimonial competence, and by refusing to hear
    evidence from Ms. White, K.B.s school teacher, during the competence <i>voir dire</i>.  The latter error, the appellant contends,
    gave rise to unfairness in the trial process.  Second, the Crown argues that in light of statutory amendments applicable
    to the competence assessment of witnesses under the age of 14, this court
    should reconsider the competency test now applicable to witnesses 14 or older
    and apply a new standard, consistent with the statutory standard now applicable
    to children under 14.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (a) <u>The
    competence decision</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that in making his ruling the
    trial judge placed too much emphasis on K.B.s apparent inability to appreciate
    the consequences of telling a lie, the penalty for lying, and the solemnity of
    criminal proceedings.  According to the
    appellant, the trial judge also relied inappropriately on K.B.s inability to
    communicate the meaning of abstract concepts such as truth, lies and promises.  The result, asserts the appellant, was a test
    more onerous than that required under s. 16 of the <i>CEA</i> and unsuitable for a witness of K.B.s intellectual and cognitive
    limitations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  We begin with the observation that the
    standard of review with respect to a trial judges decision under s. 16 of the <i>CEA</i> is a very deferential one.  As expressed by McLachlin J. in <i>R. v. Marquard</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, a
    case dealing with a child witness but, in our view, equally applicable to a
    case where an adult witness has the intellectual and cognitive ability of a
    very young child, at pp. 237-38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>It has
    repeatedly been held that a large measure of deference is to be accorded to the
    trial judge's assessment of a child's capacity to testify.&nbsp; Meticulous second-guessing
    on appeal is to be eschewed.&nbsp; As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in the
    oft-cited case of <i>R. v. Bannerman</i> a
    trial judge's discretion in determining that a child is competent to testify unless
    manifestly abused, should not be interfered with. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A highly deferential standard of review is particularly
    appropriate in the domain of witness competence inquiries because the trial
    judge hears not only what the proposed witness says, but also how it is
    said.  The importance of the latter factor
    was described in <i>R. v. Farley</i> (1995),
    23 O.R. (3d) 445 (C.A.), at pp. 456-57:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The
    trial judge had the advantage of seeing and hearing the complainant during the
    s. 16 inquiry.&nbsp; Her ultimate decision that the complainant was competent
    to testify upon promising to tell the truth was based, no doubt, on more than
    the mere words spoken by him.&nbsp; The way the complainant answered the
    questions and his overall deportment during the inquiry surely afforded the
    trial judge added and valuable insight into the complainant's cognitive skills
    and his capacity to understand the obligation to tell the truth.&nbsp; The
    strong warning against appellate second-guessing sounded in <i>Marquard</i> recognizes both the potential value of these additional insights and their
    unavailability to those engaged in appellate review.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that K.B. has some limited
    intellectual and cognitive ability.  Moreover, it is clear that, in a difficult and stressful environment,
    she did her best.  During portions of her
    testimony, she was able to understand the questions and provide appropriate
    responses.  For example, when Crown
    counsel began with a number of questions concerning her everyday life, K.B.
    responded with coherent answers about her age, the names of her current and
    former schools, the name of her former teacher, and her interest in
    hockey.  Crown counsel then proceeded to
    question K.B. about the difference between truth and lies and she responded in
    an appropriate fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. SEMENOFF: [K.B.], if I were to tell you that
    the room that were in that the walls in the room are black, would that be a
    truth or a lie, [K.B.]?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        A
    lie.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Why
    would it be a lie?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Its
    different colours in here.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        The
    truth.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        And

    quickly deteriorated.  When the trial
    judge asked her questions about her family and daily routine, K.B. was
    responsive to some but replied I dont know to many others.  When the trial judge turned to K.B.s
    understanding of truth, promises, and the consequences of telling a lie, this
    exchange followed:</p>

    brief, Dr. Kunjukrishnan testified.  Based on his observations during the <i>voir

    16 of the <i>CEA</i>.  He had concerns about her ability to
    understand concepts of truth and lying, although he acknowledged that these
    were difficult concepts for anybody.  He testified that a broader range of questions would have been
    preferable and suggested questioning K.B. about verifiable facts pertaining to

    Kunjukrishnan again took the stand.  He
    testified that the second questioning of K.B. confirms more my initial
    impression that [K.B.] is not capable of differentiating the concept of truth
    and lie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the components of s. 16(3) of the <i>CEA</i> is a promise to tell the truth by a
    prospective witness.  This entails an
    understanding of the duty to speak the truth: see <i>Farley</i>, at p. 451.  This is
    precisely what the trial judge focussed on in his discussions with counsel and
    in his ruling.  During submissions, the
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In other words, I suppose what Im saying to you is
    Im fully satisfied that this witness does not understand what a promise to
    tell the truth involves, has no concept of that.  None.  Zero.  Then thats what this
    inquiry is about.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Less vividly, in his ruling the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am fully satisfied that [K.B.] has not satisfied
    the prerequisite that she understands the duty to speak to the truth.  She cannot communicate what truth involves or
    what a lie involves, or what consequences result from truth or lies, and in
    such circumstances, quite independent of the evidence of Dr. Kunjukrishnan, I
    am not satisfied that she can be permitted to testify under a promise to tell
    the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on our review of the transcript of the competence <i>voir dire</i>, this conclusion was
    entirely open to the trial judge.  To
    hold otherwise would amount to, in the language of <i>Marquard</i>, [m]eticulous second-guessing on appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) <u>The
    fairness of the competence <i>voir dire</i></u><i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge refused to hear evidence from K.B.s
    school teacher, Heather White, during the competence <i>voir dire</i>.  The appellant
    submits that this was unfortunate and unfair.  It was unfortunate because Ms. White had extensive contact with K.B.
    over a six-year period and knew a great deal about K.B.s cognitive and
    communicative abilities; thus Ms. Whites evidence might have assisted the
    trial judge in formulating appropriate questions for the examination of K.B.
    during the <i>voir dire</i> hearing.  It was unfair because the trial judge
    permitted the defence to call Dr. Kunjukrishnan as an expert witness to provide
    an opinion about K.B.s cognitive ability; Ms. Whites experience with K.B. led
    her to have a different view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  The Crown did not signal clearly to the trial
    judge that Ms. White was a proposed witness on the issue of K.B.s competence
    to testify until the very end of the <i>voir
    dire</i> (it was clear that Ms. White would be a witness on the hearsay <i>voir dire</i>).  Moreover, on a day where several witnesses,
    including Ms. White and Dr. Kunjukrishnan, were stacked in a holding pattern,
    Crown counsel specifically agreed that the competence hearing, including K.B.s
    and Dr. Kunjukrishnans testimony, should proceed immediately after a lunch
    break.  It follows that Crown counsel
    implicitly disclaimed any potential link between Ms. Whites testimony about
    K.B.s cognitive and communication abilities and the formulation of appropriate
    questions for the examination of K.B.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for unfairness, a trial judge should be given a fair
    amount of leeway in how he or she manages a criminal trial.  On a competence <i>voir dire</i>, the mandate under s. 16 of the <i>CEA</i> rests squarely with the trial judge (the court shall  conduct
    an inquiry).  Moreover, the trial judge
    is particularly well-suited to do this.  As expressed by Binnie J. in <i>R. v.
    Parrott</i>, [2001], 1 S.C.R. 178, at paras. 57 and 60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Whether
    a complainant is able to communicate the evidence in this broad sense is a
    matter on which a trial judge can (and invariably does) form his or her own
    opinion.&nbsp; It is not a matter outside the experience and knowledge of a
    judge or jury (<i>Mohan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;23).&nbsp; It is the
    very meat and potatoes of a trial court's existence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN>. . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The
    point, I think, is that trial judges are able to assess such matters as
    childlike mental condition or poor ability to sustain questioning <i>without</i> expert assistance.&nbsp;    [Emphasis in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, K.B. was examined by Crown counsel,
    defence counsel and the trial judge.  At
    the end of K.B.s testimony, the trial judge had formed a clear view on the
    question of K.B.s competence to testify.  He communicated this to counsel, indicating that he did not need to hear
    from Ms. White and quite frankly I wouldnt have to hear from Doctor
    Kunjukrishnan either.  The only reason
    that Dr. Kunjukrishnan had already testified was for scheduling purposes
    pursuant to the agreement of the trial judge and both counsel.  Moreover, although the trial judge referred
    to Dr. Kunjukrishnans testimony in his ruling, he specifically stated that he
    had reached his conclusion about K.B.s testimonial competence quite
    independent of the evidence of Doctor Kunjukrishnan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, in our view the trial judge presided
    over a full and fair competence <i>voir dire</i> hearing in this trial.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>(c) The argument for a new competence standard </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown argues that the research and policy
    considerations that led to the enactment of s. 16.1 of the <i>CEA</i> should inform the common law interpretation of s. 16(3), the
    provision applied in this case to determine that K.B.s evidence should not be
    received.  Section 16.1 is the provision
    that now applies to assess the competence of witnesses under age 14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the coming into force of s. 16.1 of the <i>CEA</i> in 2006, the competence of adults
    with developmental disabilities to testify was determined using the same
    criteria as those applied to children under 14.  The criteria addressed the witnesss ability to understand and respond
    to questions and the witnesss capacity to understand the obligation to tell
    the truth:  see<i> Farley</i>,<i> </i>at pp. 81-83; <i>R. v. Rockey</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 829, at p.
    844, <i>per</i> McLachlin J., concurring.  The inquiry into a witnesss capacity to
    understand the obligation to tell the truth has led courts to engage in
    inquiries into the witnesss understanding of abstract concepts such as
    truth, lies and a promise.  Those
    inquiries led the trial judge to determine that K.B. was not competent to
    testify (see paras. 27 and 28 above).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament enacted s. 16.1 of the <i>CEA</i> in 2006.  The section
    applies only to persons under 14.  A
    child under 14 is presumed to have the capacity to testify (s. 16.1(1)), shall
    not take an oath or affirm before testifying (s. 16.1(2)), and the childs
    evidence has the same effect as if it were taken under oath (s. 16.1(8)).  Sections 16.1(3) and 16.1(7) are particularly
    germane:  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN>(3) The evidence of a proposed witness under
    fourteen years of age shall be received if they are able to understand and
    respond to questions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN>...</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN>(7) No proposed witness under fourteen years of
    age shall be asked any questions regarding their understanding of the nature of
    the promise to tell the truth for the purpose of determining whether their
    evidence shall be received by the court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the enactment of s. 16.1, Parliament has deemed that
    a childs capacity to testify should be decided exclusively on the childs
    ability to understand and respond to questions.  The second criterion set down in the case law, the childs ability to
    understand the obligation to tell the truth, is now irrelevant to his or her
    competence to testify.  Indeed, s.
    16.1(7) specifically prohibits inquiries into a proposed child witnesss
    understanding of the nature of the promise to tell the truth when determining
    whether their evidence should be received.  Parliament has declared that inquiries into a proposed witnesss
    capacity to answer questions about truth, lies and promise are not
    appropriate to an assessment of their testimonial capacity, and that concerns
    arising from their ability to answer such questions should go to the weight of
    their evidence once received, and not whether it can or cannot be received in
    the first place:  see <i>R. v. J.Z.S.</i> (2008), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 522
    (B.C.C.A), affd 2010 SCC 1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown contends that children and adults with
    developmental disabilities experience similar barriers in accessing the
    criminal justice system.  These barriers
    can deny children and developmentally disabled adults the full protection of
    the law in cases where they are the victims of abuse and their testimony is
    essential to the prosecution.  Counsel
    argues that concerns that children, a particularly vulnerable segment of
    society, were being kept from the witness stand and, thereby, were being denied
    the protection of the law, led to the enactment of s. 16.1.  As described above, that section makes the
    witness box more accessible to children by eliminating inquiries as to the
    childs ability to articulate an understanding of abstract concepts such as
    truth and promise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a powerful logic to the Crowns argument.  Parliament has declared that whether or not a
    proposed child witness possesses the capacity to articulate an understanding of
    certain concepts is irrelevant to that childs competence to tell the court
    what happened.  There is no reason to
    believe that the same is not true for a proposed witness like K.B., who is over
    14 and has a developmental disability.  If a child witness gave exactly the same answers to the questions posed
    to K.B. that K.B. gave, that child would be competent to testify, while K.B.s
    evidence would be declared unworthy of consideration.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This distinction is difficult to
    understand.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the court must apply the law as enacted by
    Parliament.  Before s. 16.1 came into
    force, the same criteria were used to determine the testimonial competence of </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>children
    and adults with developmental disabilities.  Parliament must be taken to have known the state of the law.  In enacting s. 16.1, Parliament chose to
    create a new testimonial competence test and to limit it so as only to apply to
    children under 14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliaments decision to do so is explained by
    reference to the research underlying the enactment of the legislation.  Section 16.1 was enacted in response to the
    research findings of the Child Witness Project, led by Professor Nicholas Bala
    at Queens University. The project concluded that there is no relationship
    between a childs ability to answer questions about abstract concepts like
    truth, lie and promise and whether the child will ultimately tell the
    truth when giving evidence:  see <i>J.Z.S.</i>, at para. 27; Nicholas Bala <i>et al.</i>, Bill C-2:  A New Law for Canadas Child Witnesses
    (2006) 32 C.R. (6th) 48, at p. 58.  It
    does not appear that Parliament was made aware of any similar research
    involving adults with developmental disabilities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislative context in which s. 16.1 was enacted
    suggests that Parliament was alive to the potential application of remedial
    legislation of this kind to vulnerable groups other than children.  Section 16.1 was enacted in Bill C-2, <i>An Act to Amend the Criminal Code
    (Protection of Children and other Vulnerable Persons) and the Canada Evidence
    Act</i>, 1st Sess., 38th Parl., 2005 (assented to 20 July 2005), S.C. 2005, c.
    32.  The legislation includes a number of
    amendments to <i>Criminal Code</i> and <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> provisions aimed at facilitating
    the giving of evidence by children and other vulnerable groups: Nicholas Bala <i>et al.</i>, at p. 48.  Bill C-2 included a number of amendments
    targeted at both children and persons with disabilities.  Some amendments targeted both groups (see
    e.g. <i>Criminal Code</i>, ss. 486.1, 486.2,
    715.1 and 715.2); some targeted only one of the two groups (see e.g. <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 486.3 and <i>CEA</i>, s. 16.1).  It must be said that Parliament was aware of
    the vulnerability of both children and adults with developmental disabilities
    and in some cases chose to protect both, while in others, chose to protect only
    children.  For whatever reason, in the
    domain of testimonial competence, Parliament chose to distinguish between
    children and adults with developmental disabilities.  It chose to create a new competence standard
    for children under 14 while retaining the existing standard in s. 16(3) for all
    others.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the language of s. 16.1 and the
    legislative context in which it was enacted, we conclude that Parliament chose to
    draw a distinction for the purposes of determining testimonial competence
    between proposed witnesses under 14 years of age and those 14 and over who have
    developmental disabilities.  Absent a
    constitutional challenge, it is not for this court to trump that distinction
    through the reinterpretation of its jurisprudence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    hearsay statements</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge delivered comprehensive reasons in
    support of his ruling that K.B.s statements to her teacher, Ms. White, and to
    the police should not be admitted under the principled exception to the hearsay
    rule.  His ruling on this issue is
    entitled to substantial deference: see <i>R.
    v. Couture</i>,<i> </i>[2007] 2 S.C.R. 517,
    at para. 81.  In particular, [a]ppellate
    deference is due to the decisions of trial judges determining that hearsay
    evidence meets the test of threshold reliability: see <i>R. v. Moo</i> (2009), 247 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 101.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by not admitting K.B.s statements, essentially for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred by effectively deciding that K.B.s testimonial incompetence
    predetermined the unreliability of her hearsay statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  In <i>R.
    v. Khelawon,</i> [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, Charron J. held that the admissibility
    analysis in a hearsay <i>voir dire</i> ought
    to be focussed on whether the hearsay dangers have been overcome.  These hearsay dangers include the inability
    to inquire into the declarants perception, memory and credibility: see <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 71.  A witnesss testimonial competence in a <i>CEA</i> s. 16 context  the ability to
    perceive, recall and communicate events and to understand the difference
    between truth and falsehood  covers precisely the same terrain.  Accordingly, it is not surprising, and it is
    not an error, that the trial judges reasoning on the issue of the threshold
    reliability in his hearsay ruling was quite similar to his reasoning on the <i>CEA </i>s. 16 <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in his treatment of the potentially confirmatory evidence of K.B.s
    sister, J.B., and the photograph of K.B. found in the respondents possession.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    trial judge carefully reviewed the testimony of J.B and the evidence relating
    to the photograph.  He rejected J.B.s
    testimony:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[J.B.]s evidence troubled me.  I felt that throughout her evidence she
    appeared to have a huge chip on her shoulder.  I am not satisfied that much reliance can be placed on her testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The trial judge recognized that
    the photograph might suggest that the respondent had a sexual interest in
    K.B.  He also stated that the
    respondents explanation  that K.B. flashed him just as he was taking her
    picture  might constitute the truth.  In
    the end, he concluded that the photo is insufficient to provide confirmatory
    evidence of a sexual assault.  In our
    view, both of these conclusions were open to the trial judge.</p>
