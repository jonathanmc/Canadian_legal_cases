  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction on one count of possession of
    crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking on the ground that the jury
    verdict was unreasonable.  In particular, he submits that there was insufficient
    evidence of his knowledge or control of the cocaine to establish constructive
    possession under s.&nbsp;4(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> or joint
    possession under s. 4(3)(b) of the <i>Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not challenge the well-established test for an
    unreasonable verdict.  That test, as set out by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v.
    Biniaris</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1, is whether, on all the evidence, the
    verdict is one that “a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably
    have reached”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no direct evidence in this case linking the cocaine to the
    appellant.  The Crown’s case rested on circumstantial evidence, which included
    the following: (1) about 26.92 grams of crack cocaine were situated in plain
    view on the centre console of the car between the driver and the appellant, who
    was a passenger in the front seat of the car; (2) the drugs, contained in a
    small opaque grocery bag, were perched on the console atop two cell phones; (3)
    the grocery bag was knotted over its contents into a shape like a golf ball;
    (4) the drugs had a street value in excess of approximately $5,380; (5) the
    appellant was in the stopped vehicle for at least five minutes prior to his
    arrest; and (6) on his arrest, the appellant was found in possession of $270 in
    small denominations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was evidence of the physical proximity of the drugs to the
    appellant, the degree of visibility of the drugs, the shared use of the vehicle
    at the time of the appellant’s arrest, the quantity and value of the drugs
    seized, the size and nature of the bag containing the drugs, the presence of
    equipment – cell phones – normally used in drug trafficking, and possession by
    the appellant of monies in a form and amount consistent with drug trafficking.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In combination, this evidence provided the basis on which the jury could
    properly infer knowledge and control of the crack cocaine by the appellant
    sufficient to establish his possession of the drugs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that because the jury acquitted him on a charge of
    possession of the proceeds of crime, the evidence of the money found on his
    person was of diminished evidential worth in assessing whether the Crown had
    met its burden to establish the appellant’s knowledge and control of the
    drugs.  He acknowledges, however, that this evidence is one factor to be taken
    into account in assessing the sufficiency of all the evidence of knowledge and
    control.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the presence of the money on the appellant’s person was one
    piece of circumstantial evidence available for consideration by the jury as
    pointing to the appellant’s knowledge and control of the drugs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that the appellant did not testify.  When considering the
    reasonableness of a verdict, this is a relevant consideration for this court:
    see <i>R. v. Dell</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 863 (C.A.), at para. 35.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no suggestion in this case that the trial judge erred in any
    way in his instructions to the jury.  We are satisfied that the verdict was one
    that this properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have
    rendered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction is dismissed.  The appellant’s appeal from
    sentence is now moot.  Accordingly, his sentence appeal is dismissed as
    abandoned.</p>
