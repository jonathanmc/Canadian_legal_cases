  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Znamensky Selekcionno-Gibridny Center LLC moves for security for costs
    of the appeal launched by Donaldson International Livestock Ltd. from the order
    of Pitt J. dated September 29, 2009.  Pitt J. ordered that two international arbitration
    awards in favour of Znamensky be recognized and enforced in Ontario.  In
    addition, he awarded costs in favour of Znamensky in the amount of $30,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dispute has its genesis in a contract providing for the supply of
    8,505 pigs by Donaldson (a leading Canadian Ontario exporter of purebred pigs)
    to Znamensky (an agro-industrial Russian company).  The contract contained an
    arbitration clause requiring all disputes between the parties to be decided by
    arbitration before the International Commercial Arbitration Court at the
    Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation (“ICAC”) in Moscow. 
    A dispute arose respecting the health of the pigs supplied and Znamensky filed
    a claim with the ICAC pursuant to the arbitration clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donaldson then commenced an anti-suit injunction proceeding in Ontario,
    seeking to stop the arbitration proceeding on the principal ground that death
    threats allegedly made by Znamensky prevented its witnesses from attending the
    arbitration in Moscow, thereby rendering the proceeding unfair.  Znamensky
    sought an order staying the Ontario proceedings.  On November 27, 2007, Gans J.
    dismissed the anti-suit injunction claim and granted the stay.  For purposes of
    the appeal, and this motion, the two primary bases for this decision were the
    following: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote" style="line-height:200%">(1) Donaldson
      had not established the background of threats, on the materials before him,
      even on the balance of probabilities, and, in any event, the threat issue could
      not be resolved summarily but only on the basis of a <i>viva voce</i> hearing
      (which Donaldson did not request); and </p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote" style="line-height:200%">(2) Znamensky’s
      offer to move the arbitration out of Russia to a neutral spot all but
      eliminated, or at least minimized, the threat of intimidation and the prospect
      of apprehended harm to Donaldson and its witnesses by reason of the threats.  He
      awarded costs against Donaldson in the amount of approximately $78,000.00 plus
      interest.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order of Gans J. was affirmed by this Court, which refused
    Donaldson’s request that it order the trial of the issue of the death threats: (2008),
    305 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 432 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 28.  The Court said that
    the time to have requested the trial of the issue concerning the death threats
    was when the parties were before the motion judge.  However, the Court also refused
    to grant an interim injunction prohibiting enforcement of any arbitration
    award, stating at para. 30 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Should Znamensky take steps to enforce its arbitral
    awards against Donaldson in the Ontario courts, then it would seem to me that
    Donaldson should be free to resist the enforcement of those awards on whatever
    basis it chooses, subject to the ruling of the presiding judge.  … [T]he issue
    of enforcement must, at this stage, be dealt with at first instance and not in
    this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal awarded costs against Donaldson in the amount of
    $25,000.00.  With interest, the costs outstanding with respect to the
    proceedings before Gans J. and the Court of Appeal (“the first Ontario
    proceedings”) now approximate $115,000.00.  They remain outstanding and unpaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Znamensky then proceeded with the arbitration in Russia.  Donaldson did
    not attend.  In the result, on March 6, 2008 the ICAC panel awarded Znamensky $1,234,416.65
    in damages together with $26,205.28 as compensation for the arbitration fee.  On
    May 13, 2008, the panel made a further award in favour of Znamensky for
    $424,732.94 in damages and $9,006.21 as compensation for arbitration fees paid.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Znamensky applied to enforce the arbitration awards against Donaldson in
    Ontario.  Pitt J. granted the order on essentially two bases: (1) Donaldson was
    precluded from raising the threat issue in defence to the enforcement
    proceedings on issue estoppel grounds; and (2) in any event, the finding of
    Gans J. that Znamensky’s offer to alter the venue of the arbitration virtually
    eliminated the threats as a ground for vitiating the arbitration proceedings,
    was dispositive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donaldson has appealed Pitt J.’s order.  I am told the appeal is
    scheduled to be argued on April 7, 2010.  In the meantime, Znamensky seeks
    security for costs of the appeal in the amount of $25,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would not grant the order.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion is brought pursuant to rule 61.06(1), which states:</p>
  <p class="Double-indent-subquote">In an appeal where it appears
    that,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote">(a) there is good
      reason to believe that the appeal is frivolous and vexatious and that the
      appellant has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal;</p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote">(b) an order for
      security for costs could be made against the appellant under rule 56.01; or</p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote">(c) for other
      good reason, security for costs should be ordered,</p>
    <p class="Double-indent-subquote">a judge of the appellate court,
      on motion by the respondent, may make such order for security for costs of the
      proceeding and of the appeal as is just. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its written materials filed in support of the motion, Znamensky
    founded its argument on subsection (1)(b) above, i.e., that an order for
    security for costs could be made against the appellant pursuant to rule 56.01(1)(c)
    or (d).  Those provisions state that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court, on motion by
    the defendant or respondent in a proceeding, may make such order for security
    for costs as is just where it appears that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) the defendant or
    respondent has an order against the plaintiff or applicant for costs in the
    same or another proceeding that remains unpaid in whole or in part;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) the plaintiff or
    applicant is a corporation or a nominal plaintiff or applicant, and there is
    good reason to believe that the plaintiff or applicant has insufficient assets
    in Ontario to pay the costs of the defendant or respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, Znamensky’s argument was that Donaldson has not paid the
    outstanding costs orders totalling $115,000 and, in addition – based on
    information obtained on an examination of Donaldson in aid of execution
    respecting those unpaid orders –there is good reason to believe that Donaldson
    has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of Znamensky if the latter
    is successful on the appeal.  The evidence suggests, at least, that Donaldson’s
    net assets are worth about $125,000 as against the outstanding costs orders of
    $115,000 in connection with the first Ontario proceedings plus the outstanding
    costs order of $30,000 from below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, based on the line of authority in this Court establishing that
    a respondent on appeal may not rely on rule 61.06(1)(b) to obtain an order for
    security for costs of an appeal as against a defendant/appellant, Mr. Bredt
    fairly concedes that he cannot resort to subsection (1)(b) and rule 56.01 in
    the circumstances.  The policy rationale behind this line of jurisprudence is
    not to impose security for costs upon foreign or impecunious defendants who are
    forced into court by others to defend themselves.  See <i>Diversitel
    Communications Inc. v. Glacier Bay Inc</i>., [2004] O.J. No. 10, 181 O.A.C. 6 (C.A.),
    at para 8; <i>GEAC Canada Ltd. v. Craig Erickson Systems Inc</i>., [1994] O.J.
    No. 1061, 26 C.P.C. (3d) 355 (C.A.); <i>Toronto Dominion Bank. v. Szilagyi
    Farms Ltd</i>., (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 433 (C.A.).  In <i>Szilagyi Farms</i>,
    Morden J.A. expressed the rationale in these terms, at p. 440:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… it has for a long time been the accepted position
    that no party should have to give security for costs as a condition of simply
    defending itself (see <i>Re Percy and Kelly Cobalt &amp; Chrome Iron Mining Co.</i> (1876), 2 Ch. D. 531, 24 W.R. 1057) and, in this regard, it can be said that an
    appeal is simply a step in the proceeding in which the defendant appealing is
    continuing to defend itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the position is that Donaldson is the impecunious defendant – or
    at least arguably so – who was simply defending itself against Znamensky’s enforcement
    proceedings and now simply seeks to take another step in the proceeding by
    continuing to defend itself through the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bredt also candidly concedes that he is not seeking refuge under
    rule 61.06(1)(a).  He does not argue the appeal is frivolous or vexatious,
    although he does submit (with an eye on subrule (1)(c), to which I will turn in
    a moment, no doubt) that “it is not the strongest appeal.”  Mr. Waldin, on the
    other hand, submits that the appeal is “very strong” (no doubt with an eye on
    the same subrule).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion therefore turns on the application of rule 61.06(1)(c).  In
    my view, Znamensky is not entitled to succeed on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the wording of rule 61.06(1)(c) is clear: where it appears that
    “for <i>other</i> good reason” security for costs should be ordered, the judge
    may make such an order.  This must mean good reason <i>other than</i> those
    already encompassed in rule 61.06(1)(a) or (1)(b) – and, through (1)(b), those
    encompassed in rule 56.01.  In other words, a party seeking an order for
    security for costs under rule 61.06(1)(c) may not resort to what are in effect
    the same grounds that would support a rule 56.01 order when it is barred by the
    line of jurisprudence cited above from relying on subrule (1)(b), the gate
    through which it must travel to have access to rule 56.01.  Here, Mr. Waldin
    submits, that is precisely what Znamensky is attempting to do – “back door” itself
    into rule 56.01(c) and (d) through rule 61.06(1)(c)  when it is forbidden from
    accessing it through rule 61.06(1)(b).  Stripped to its essentials, Znamensky’s
    motion is founded on the still-unpaid costs orders and Donaldson’s
    impecuniosity.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bredt acknowledges this difficulty.  However, he contends that the
    significant unpaid costs orders and Donaldson’s insufficient assets are
    nonetheless relevant to the rule 61.06(1)(c) argument.  Why? Because Znamensky
    is akin to the foreign party that is forced to come into the jurisdiction to
    defend itself, having had to respond to Donaldson’s unsuccessful anti-suit
    injunction proceedings and the appeal from the order of Gans J., and having
    incurred the substantial costs of that proceeding as reflected (partially) in
    the unpaid costs orders.  Moreover, the issues dealt with in the first Ontario
    proceedings and resolved in Znamensky’s favour – principally, the threat
    allegations – were integral to the issues raised by Donaldson in the
    proceedings before Pitt J., and form a substantial part of the issues raised on
    the appeal from the order of Pitt J.  In that sense, Mr. Bredt says, <i>Donaldson</i> is, in effect, the “plaintiff” who brought the foreign party into proceedings
    in Ontario and is simply seeking to protect its original position through the
    appeal.  Donaldson is not, therefore, an impecunious defendant seeking only to
    defend itself.  It is an impecunious party that has caused Znamensky to incur
    considerable – as yet unpaid – costs by dragging it into Ontario proceedings,
    and now seeks to expose Znamensky to the risk of even further losses in this
    respect if unsuccessful on the appeal.  To this mix, Mr. Bredt adds his
    submission that the appeal – while he cannot say it is frivolous – is “not the
    strongest” appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Skilfully put as this argument is, I do not accept it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there may be a connection between the issues dealt with here and
    below in the first Ontario proceedings and the issues raised before Justice
    Pitt and on the appeal of his order, the fact is that Znamensky would have had
    to come to Ontario to enforce its awards whether the earlier proceedings had
    taken place or not.  <i>Znamensky</i> is therefore the “plaintiff” and
    Donaldson the defendant seeking to defend the enforcement claim being asserted
    against it.  The rationale underpinning the <i>Szilagyi Farms</i> line of
    authorities precluding access to rule 61.06(1)(b) against defendant/appellants
    remains relevant.  Apart from the contention that the appeal is “not the
    strongest”, Znamensky’s claim for security for costs continues to rest on the
    arguments that there are substantial unpaid costs orders outstanding and that
    Donaldson does not have sufficient assets to pay them if it is unsuccessful on
    the appeal.  These arguments are the stuff of rule 56.01(c) and (d), which cannot
    be accessed by a respondent in the position of Znamensky, disqualified as it is
    from passing through the forbidden rule 61.06(1)(b) gate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion must therefore be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donaldson is entitled to its costs of the motion.  If counsel cannot
    agree they may file brief submissions, not to exceed five pages in length,
    within two weeks of the release of these reasons.</p>
