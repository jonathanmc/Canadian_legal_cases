    acted in bad faith in rejecting his application to amend the schedule to the
    relevant by-law.  Second, the appellant
    contends that the City Council and the application judge erred in their
    interpretation of the meaning to be given to “residence” in the relevant by-law.  Third, the appellant argues that he was not
    afforded procedural fairness in the process culminating in the rejection of his
    application.  </span></p>
  <h2>Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant owns a licensed adult entertainment services
    parlour in London.  He wanted to open a
    second store at a location on Dundas Street in the city of London.  To secure a licence for the second location,
    the appellant made an application to City Council to amend the schedule to the
    relevant by-law.  That schedule listed
    the locations where a business like that run by the appellant could be operated
    in the city.  The appellant applied to
    have the schedule amended to add the Dundas Street location.  The validity of the by-law is not in issue in
    these proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The by-law limited the locations in the city where a business
    like that operated by the appellant could operate.  Under the terms of the by-law, a location
    could be added to the schedule to the by-law only if it met certain locational prerequisites.  Generally speaking, those prerequisites prohibited
    operating this kind of business on a property close to a school, residence or
    religious institution.  The limitation tied
    to proximity to a residence is the important one for the purposes of this proceeding.  Under the terms of the by-law, a side
    property line of a parcel of land upon which the business was to be located
    could not:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… <span class=GramE>abut</span> a parcel of land
    upon which a residence is situated existing on the date of the licence
    application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant first brought his application in
    2005.  In January 2006, the City solicitor
    for London advised the appellant’s lawyer that in her opinion the Dundas Street
    location met the criteria in the by-law and could be added to the schedule.  In reaching her opinion, the City solicitor
    noted that the abutting property, 419 Spruce Street, was empty at the time of
    the application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a subsequent meeting before the Board of
    Control, a committee of Council, material was placed before the Board
    indicating that 419 Spruce Street was not vacant at the relevant time.  Other concerns were also raised by local
    residents.  The Board of Control passed a
    resolution denying the amendment to the schedule.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A Superior Court judge subsequently quashed the
    Board’s resolution holding that the appellant had been denied procedural due
    process (<i>Vergara v. Corporation of the
    City of London</i>, Court File 51282, reasons released January 9, 2007).  The Superior Court judge remitted the
    appellant’s application to the Board of Control for a continuation of the hearing
    on the merits of the application.  Ultimately,
    the Board refused the application and the City Council, by resolution, refused to
    amend the schedule to the relevant by-law.  That refusal led to this proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City gave two reasons for refusing the
    application.  The first reason, referred
    to in argument as the “merger” approach, was premised on the City’s assertion
    that the joint ownership of the Dundas Street property where the business would
    be located and two adjacent residential properties on Spruce Street required
    that the three properties be considered as one for the purposes of determining
    compliance with the by-law.  On the
    “merger” approach, the three properties constituted a single “parcel of land” for
    the purpose of determining whether a residence abutted on the property on which
    the business would be located.  It was
    common ground that if the three properties were properly viewed as a single parcel
    of land for the purposes of the by-law, a residence located at 423 Spruce
    Street abutted that property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second reason given by City Council for
    refusing the application assumed that the location on Dundas Street was the
    relevant parcel of land.  City Council
    took the position that 419 Spruce Street, an abutting property, was a residence
    at the time of the application even though it may not have been occupied as of
    that date.  In reaching that conclusion, City
    Council referred to the residential zoning status of 419 Spruce Street, the
    historical use of the property, the dwelling house on the property, and its
    likely future use.  </p>
  <h2>The Bad Faith Argument</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that City Council’s
    representation that the Dundas Street location did not meet the criteria for
    inclusion in the schedule to the by-law was merely a ruse and that the real
    reason the City refused his application was the “not in our neighbourhood”
    complaints raised by the local residents beginning in 2006.  The appellant submits that these complaints
    were irrelevant to his application to amend the by-law to include the Dundas
    Street location as a permitted location for the operation of his business and
    that City Council acted in bad faith by basing its denial on a consideration
    which was irrelevant to the application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This submission rests entirely on what the
    appellant claims is the inference to be drawn from the change of position by
    the City in 2006.  The appellant contends
    that the City solicitor initially took the position that the Dundas Street
    property complied with the requirements of the by-law, and only took a
    different position after local residents complained at the first public meeting
    about the effect of the operation of the appellant’s business on their
    neighbourhood.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has the onus of demonstrating bad
    faith and the court will not readily draw an inference that a City Council
    acted in bad faith.  The appellant has
    not discharged his onus.  Clearly, City
    Council, as it should, considered what the local residents had to say about the
    proposed change to the schedule in the by-law.  Some of the representations made by residents challenged the factual basis
    upon which the City solicitor had given her initial opinion.  In light of the comments of the residents,
    the City called for further investigation by its legal staff and ultimately
    acted upon the revised advice given to it.  We find nothing in the record to support the contention that the reasons
    given by the City for rejecting the application were disingenuous and contrived
    to hide the true reasons for the refusal. </p>
  <h2>The Residence Issue</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is agreed that 419 Spruce Street abuts the
    side property line of the Dundas Street property on which the appellant wants
    to operate his business.  The question is
    whether as of the date of the application, 419 Spruce Street was “a parcel of
    land upon which a residence is situated existing on the day of the licence
    application”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>419 Spruce Street is zoned for residential
    use.  The building on the property has
    been used as a residence for many years.  As of May 31, 2005, the date of the appellant’s application, the building
    located on the property was under renovation and had been under renovation for
    some time.  A building permit had been
    issued some three years earlier.  There
    was no gas, hydro or water services to the building.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Taylor, a contractor, worked for the owner
    of 419 Spruce Street.  The same person
    owned the Dundas Street property.  There was
    uncontradicted evidence that Mr. Taylor lived in the house on the property at
    419 Spruce Street for some time after he was hired to renovate that
    property.  There was a dispute as to how
    long Mr. Taylor lived in that house.  There was substantial evidence that he lived there until October 2005,
    several months after the appellant made his application to amend the
    by-law.  In 2006, Mr. Taylor provided a
    statutory declaration to the City solicitor stating that he lived at 419 Spruce
    Street as of May 31, 2005, the date of the application.  Mr. Taylor was apparently not available in
    2007 when the public meeting to consider the appellant’s application was
    completed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The dispute between the parties concerning 419
    Spruce Street related exclusively to whether Mr. Taylor was living there as of
    May 2005.  There was no dispute about the
    zoning of the property, its historical use, the condition of the building
    located on the property, or that the building had been under renovation for
    some time.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As indicated above, the City concluded that it
    was irrelevant to the determination of the residence question that the dwelling
    was unoccupied on the date of the appellant’s application.  The application judge, after thoroughly
    reviewing the factors relevant to the character of the property as of the date
    of the application (see para. 32 of her reasons), indicated at para. 33:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… I am satisfied that 419 Spruce Street was a
    residence or was capable of being a residence at the time of Mr. Vergara’s
    application …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The factors identified by the application judge
    were supported by the evidence and were all relevant to the question of whether
    419 Spruce Street was a residence as of the date of the application.  We agree with the City that it was not
    essential that the dwelling on the property be used as a residence on the very
    day of the appellant’s application.  We
    do not read the application judge as holding to the contrary.  The building had a long history of use as a
    residence, was zoned residential, and was clearly capable of being used as a
    residence perhaps with very minor modifications.  The property had not lost its character as a
    residence even if the building located on the property was not being lived in as
    of the date of the application. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant frankly acknowledged
    that if we rejected her argument that 419 Spruce Street was not a parcel of
    land upon which a residence was situated, her appeal must fail regardless of
    the merits of her contention that City Council’s “merger” approach was
    incorrect.  We agree with that concession.  We need not consider the correctness of the
    “merger” approach put forward by City Council.  We note that the application judge also did not consider this
    argument.  </p>
  <h2>The Procedural Fairness Argument</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant acknowledges that he had no
    statutory right to a hearing.  It is also
    clear that the matters relevant to his application were addressed in a public
    meeting and that he was given an opportunity to make submissions concerning the
    matters upon which the application ultimately turned.  The appellant submits, however, that in the
    circumstances natural justice required that he be given a hearing where he
    could directly challenge the evidence put against him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When pressed in argument, counsel for the
    appellant indicated that a full hearing would have potentially allowed her to cross-examine
    Mr. Taylor (if he was available) as to where he lived at the relevant
    time.  As is evident from both the
    reasons given by City Council and the application judge, Mr. Taylor’s actual
    residency on the date of the application was not determinative or even
    particularly significant to the outcome.  Counsel next submitted that at a full hearing, the appellant would have
    had an opportunity to address the various complaints made by the local
    residents.  Those complaints were
    irrelevant to whether the Dundas Street property abutted a property upon which
    a residence was situated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has not demonstrated that a full
    hearing would have been of any assistance to him on the issue upon which his
    application ultimately turned.  He has
    not demonstrated that the failure to afford him a hearing resulted in any procedural
    unfairness in the process.    </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is dismissed.  The parties agree that the successful party, the
    respondent, is entitled to costs in the amount of $12,840, inclusive of GST and
    disbursements.</p>
