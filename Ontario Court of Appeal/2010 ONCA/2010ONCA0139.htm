  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Leo-Mensah operated a business through which he, or those
    whom he employed, prepared and submitted his clients’ income tax returns.  As part of the tax services that he provided,
    Mr. Leo-Mensah provided false charitable donation receipts to his clients.  He either submitted the receipts to the CRA
    upon request or provided them to his clients.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, 2004 and 2005, he submitted 801 tax returns
    claiming approximately $11.7 million in false charitable donations. As a result
    of these false claims, tax refunds in the amount of approximately $3.28 million
    were paid out by the CRA to Mr. Leo-Mensah’s clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Leo-Mensah failed to report the income that he
    derived from his fraudulent activity.  As
    a result, he evaded income tax of $42,457.00 in 2004 and $103,309.00 in
    2005.  He failed to file an income tax
    return for 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Leo-Mensah pleaded guilty to one count of fraud (Criminal Code, s. 380(1)(a)) and two counts of income tax evasion (Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985 (5th Supp.), c. 1, s. 239(1)(d)).  After being given credit on a two-for-one basis for 11 months of pre-trial custody, he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $145,766.00, concurrent on all charges (the &ldquo;global fine&rdquo;).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal sentence and, if leave is granted, asks that the sentence be increased.  It argues that the sentence imposed was manifestly unfit given the seriousness of the offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Leo-Mensah responds by arguing that he was not the
    mastermind behind the scheme, that others participated in it and should be held
    accountable, and that he was duped by pastors into believing that the scheme
    resulted in money being given to needy children in Africa.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would grant leave to
    appeal and allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the sentencing judge erred in three respects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it appears that she failed to consider, as an
    aggravating factor, that the value of the fraud committed exceeded $1,000,000.  This she was obliged to do pursuant to s.
    380.1(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the sentencing judge appears to have placed
    significant emphasis on Mr. Leo-Mensah’s childcare obligations when determining
    his sentence.  She likened his
    circumstances to those of the accused in <i>R.
    v. Pierce </i>(1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, [1997] 3 S.C.R. xiii.  Unlike
    the situation in <i>Pierce</i>, however, in
    the present case there was no evidence before the court on the extent of the
    respondent’s childcare obligations.  At
    the time of his arrest, the respondent was separated from his spouse and his four
    children continued to live with their mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, given the magnitude of the fraud, the breach of
    trust, blatant abuse of the charitable donations scheme under the <i>Income Tax Act </i>and Mr. Leo-Mensah’s
    pivotal role in the scam, the sentence imposed falls below the range that has
    been established by this court for large-scale fraud cases.  The amount and duration of the fraud
    perpetrated by the respondent is significant, amounting to almost $3.28 million
    over a three-year period and involving hundreds of fraudulent tax returns.  In <i>R.
    v. Bogart</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 75 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, [2003] 1 S.C.R. vi, this court established that a penitentiary
    sentence is the norm, not the exception, in cases of large-scale fraud and in
    which there are no extraordinary mitigating circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would note, as well, that in accordance with R. v. Ward (1980), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 15 (Ont. C.A.), separate fines are to be imposed for each offence and such fines are not to be made concurrent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be apparent that I do not accept that Mr.
    Leo-Mensah was but a dupe in this matter.  The sentencing judge found that he planned and organized the scheme in
    order to defraud the government of Canada.  She stated that Mr. Leo-Mensah “was the instigator and the primary
    participant in this scheme and his degree of moral culpability or
    responsibility for the offences is very high”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no reason to interfere with these findings.  If there are other people who participated in
    the fraudulent activity, the respondent is free to provide that information to
    the authorities who may take legal action against them.  The fact that others may also be guilty of
    offences does not diminish the respondent’s culpability, however.  There is an inadequate record to determine
    the veracity of the respondent’s claim that he was motivated by a desire to
    help needy children in Africa.  Assuming
    that to be the case, however, it does not justify or excuse the wrongdoing that
    he committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this court has been reluctant to re-incarcerate
    an offender who has served the sentence originally imposed and been released
    into the community, reincarceration is warranted where the original sentence
    was so far below that which was required that the interests of justice require
    the court intervene: see <i>R. v. D.G.F.</i>,
    2010 ONCA 27 at paras. 33-34.  In my
    view, this is such a case and a period of reincarceration is necessary.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and
    allow the appeal.  I would sentence the respondent
    to a further two year period of incarceration and substitute for the global
    fine, separate fines for each of the two income tax offences, namely, a fine of
    $42,457.00 for the conviction for income tax evasion in 2004 and a fine of $103,309.00
    for the conviction for income tax evasion in 2005.    </p>
