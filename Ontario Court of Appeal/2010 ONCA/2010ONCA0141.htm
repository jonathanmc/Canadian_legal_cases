  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following approximately a four-week trial before J.
    Wright J. of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, the appellant
    William Bruce Montague was convicted of 26 firearms-related offences.  His wife, the appellant Donna Jeanne
    Montague, was convicted of one count of unlicensed possession of a
    firearm.  Mr. Montague was sentenced to a
    global sentence of 18 months’ incarceration, followed by 90 days imprisonment
    to be served in the community, plus probation for one year.  A lifetime weapons prohibition order was also
    made.  Mrs. Montague received a suspended
    sentence and was placed on probation for six months.  The Montagues appeal against conviction and Mr.
    Montague appeals as well against sentence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.         Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Montague is a firearms dealer and
    manufacturer.  He allowed his firearms licence
    to expire in November 2002 without renewal.  His Firearms Acquisition Certificate expired in November 2003.  Mrs. Montague’s firearms licence expired
    without renewal in March 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September 2004, acting on the authority of two
    search warrants, the police seized more than 200 firearms and related devices,
    together with in excess of 20,000 rounds of ammunition and boxes of
    military-related books and associated paraphernalia from the Montagues’
    home.  Many of these weapons were
    discovered in a hidden storage room in the basement of the house.  It is fair to say that the quantity and
    nature of the seized arsenal of weapons and associated items may have been
    sufficient for a small-scale insurrection.  The evidence at trial established that Mr. Montague believed himself to
    be preparing to defend <span class=GramE>himself</span>, and others, in the
    event of a war.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 20, 2005, Mr. Montague was charged with various
    firearms-related offences under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> on a 53-count indictment.  Mrs.
    Montague was charged with one count of unlicensed possession of a firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the Montagues did not contest many of the
    essential facts.  Mr. Montague, for
    example, admitted that at the relevant times, neither he nor any business run
    by him had any legal authorization or licence permitting either or both of the
    Montagues to possess the firearms and associated devices that were seized by
    the police.  Mr. Montague further acknowledged
    that at the relevant times, he knew he did not have the requisite licence or
    legal authorization permitting possession of the items in question.  Nonetheless, he maintained that the seized
    firearms were legally his and that he was entitled to possess them for life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Montagues brought a motion challenging the
    constitutional validity of <span class=GramE>various</span> of the firearms
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the <i>Firearms Act</i>, S.C. 1995, c. 39 and
    related firearms regulations. They argued that they were entitled to possess
    the firearms at issue because they allegedly had “a constitutional right to
    possess firearms for self-defence”, derived from the law of England and
    protected by ss. 26 and 7 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    which could not be legislatively restricted or regulated.  The trial judge disagreed and, in a ruling
    dated November 6, 2007, he dismissed the motion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Montagues raise a large number of grounds of appeal
    in support of their conviction appeal.  These include attacks on: (1) the trial judge’s ruling regarding the
    constitutionality of the impugned firearms provisions; (2) the validity of the
    second search warrant executed on their home, whereunder the weapons in the
    hidden storage room were seized; (3) the trial judge’s decision, prior to the
    commencement of trial, to excuse certain persons from jury service; (4) the
    Crown’s closing address at trial; (5) the trial judge’s approach to the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i> for some of the
    offences at issue, including his instructions to the jury on this issue; (6) the
    amendment of the indictment at trial to make it conform to the wording of the
    applicable firearms regulations; and (7) the trial judge’s charge to the jury
    on the offence of firearms conversion under s. 102 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Montague also appeals from sentence.  He argues, among other matters, that: (1) the
    sentence imposed violates his rights under s. 12 of the <i>Charter</i>; (2) his overall sentence was inordinately harsh; and (3)
    the trial judge erred by refusing to hear the proposed testimony of the jury
    foreman on sentencing.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        Conviction Appeals</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Constitutionality of Firearms Provisions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The basis of the Montagues’ challenge to the
    constitutionality of various provisions of Canada’s firearms legislation is
    succinctly set out at paragraph 73 of their factum on appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore it is in compliance with our inherent
    constitutional rights derived from English rights to keep arms in our homes
    without restriction for self defence and all laws which restrict this principle
    and under which the accused [were] convicted are void pursuant to our common
    law, the <i>BNA Act</i>, sections 7, 26 and
    52 of the <i>Charter</i> and the <i>BNA Act</i> of 1867.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge noted, much of the time at trial was
    consumed by the Montagues’ challenge to the efficacy of the firearms
    registration system in Canada.  In his
    ruling, the trial judge observed that this was not the issue in this case.  That observation was accurate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Montagues contend that they have a
    constitutional right to possess arms in their home for self-defence, free from
    government interference or regulation.  They submit that the legislation and regulations under which they were
    charged violate that right and are therefore of no force and effect.  Hence, they say that the prosecution against
    them should have been dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument before this court, the Montagues argue
    that whatever the course of <span class=GramE>Canada’s legislative history in
    relation to firearms regulation, the world</span> changed in 1982 with the
    advent of the <i>Charter</i>.  From that date forward, they submit,
    Parliament was precluded from abrogating existing fundamental rights and
    freedoms.  They maintain that the right
    to possess firearms in the home for self defence without state intervention was
    one of those fundamental rights.  Accordingly, as a result of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the existing firearms legislation, which regulates the right to possess and use
    firearms, is constitutionally invalid as an unwarranted intrusion on the
    Montagues’ pre-existing common law right to possess and use firearms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of this argument, the Montagues submit that
    Article 7 of the <i>Bill of Rights, 1689</i>,
    1 Will &amp; Mary, sess. 2, c. 2, is “the entrenchment and verbalization of the
    inherent right to possess firearms for self-defence”.  There are several difficulties with this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Article 7 of the <i>Bill of Rights, 1689</i> reads: “That the subjects which are
    Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions <i>and as allowed by law</i>” (emphasis added).  Thus, the plain language of Article 7 of the <i>Bill of Rights, 1689</i> recognized that the
    right to possess arms for the purpose of defence was subject to allowance by
    law.  In other words, Article 7
    recognized Parliament’s jurisdiction to constrain the right to possess
    firearms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, although the Montagues contend that the right
    envisaged by Article 7 of the <i>Bill of
    Rights, 1689</i> comes within the ambit of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, Article 7 has neither directly nor indirectly been
    incorporated into Canada’s constitution.  In <i>New Brunswick Broadcasting Co.
    v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319, at
    para. 54, McLachlin J. (as she then was) clearly stated that provisions of the <i>Bill of Rights, 1689</i> “cannot be directly
    transported without specific reference” and, further, “I do not think that the
    wording of the preamble to the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1867</i> can be taken to refer to [a] specific article of the Constitution
    of the United Kingdom.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, contrary to the Montagues’ contention, the
    Supreme Court of Canada has addressed the question of whether the possession
    and use of firearms is a constitutionally protected right and has rejected the
    notion that Canadians have an absolute constitutional right to possess and use
    firearms.  See <i>R. v. Wiles</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 9; <i>R. v. Hasselwander</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 398, at para. 414.  Although s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> does not appear to have been expressly invoked in those
    cases, the Supreme Court stated in <i>Hasselwander</i> at para. 414 that, “Canadians, unlike Americans, do not have a constitutional
    right to bear arms.”  In <i>Wiles</i> at para. 9, the Supreme Court
    said: “[P]ossession and use of firearms is not a right or freedom guaranteed
    under the <i>Charter</i>, but a privilege.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Montagues submit that the above-quoted comments are <i>obiter</i>, as ss. 7 and 26 of the <i>Charter</i> were not engaged in <i>Hasselwander</i> and <i>Wiles</i> or any related jurisprudence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    Supreme Court’s comments in <i>Hasselwander</i> and <i>Wiles</i> apply with equal force to
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has also recognized that the
    possession and use of firearms is a heavily regulated activity aimed at
    ensuring peace, order and public safety: see <i>Wiles</i>, at para. 9; <i>Reference
    re Firearms Act (Can.)</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, even assuming that a right to possess and
    use firearms comes within the reach of s. 7 of the <span class=GramE><i>Charter</i>, that</span> right, like all
    other fundamental rights and freedoms, is not absolute.  The impugned firearms legislation does not
    prohibit the right to possess and use firearms for self-defence – in the home
    or elsewhere.  Rather, it simply
    regulates the circumstances under which such possession and use are
    permissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we note that the trial judge considered in
    detail the Montagues’ constitutional challenge to the impugned firearms
    provisions of the <i>Code</i>, the <i>Firearms Act</i> and associated regulations enacted
    under the latter statute.  His reasons in
    support of his ruling dismissing that challenge are thoughtful and
    comprehensive.  He essentially held that
    there is no protected constitutional right in Canada to possess or use
    firearms.  We agree with this conclusion
    and see no basis on which to interfere with his ruling.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Attack on Second Search Warrant</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the eve of trial, Mr. Montague sought to challenge
    the validity of the second search warrant obtained by the police on September
    20, 2004.  It was pursuant to this search
    warrant that the police obtained access to the hidden weapons storage room in
    the Montagues’ home and seized a large quantity of firearms, associated devices
    and firearms-related paraphernalia.  In
    the exercise of his trial management power, the trial judge refused to allow
    this last-minute attack on the search warrant to proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We decline to interfere with this discretionary
    decision by the trial judge.  On the
    record before him, he was entirely justified in denying Mr. Montague’s motion
    to challenge the second search warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many of the background facts concerning the obtaining
    of the second search warrant and the police entry to the hidden storage room are
    set out in the record, including in the transcript of Mr. Montague’s bail
    hearing on September 20, 2004 and in affidavits sworn by Detective Sergeant
    Wade Meeks and Detective Constable Randall Belluz of the Ontario Provincial
    Police, filed with the trial judge.  There is no need to repeat those facts in these reasons.  However, we note, in particular, the
    following.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a judicial pre-trial held on December 21, 2005, the Montagues’
    trial counsel indicated that he would inform Crown counsel within approximately
    one week whether the defence intended to seek to challenge the second search
    warrant.  Defence counsel failed to do
    so.  On April 30, 2006, the Montagues
    delivered a “Notice of Application and Constitutional Issue”.  That Notice did not refer to the exclusion of
    any evidence as a constitutional remedy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further judicial pre-trial was held by the trial
    judge on September 7, 2007.   He accepted
    that the evidentiary phase of the Montagues’ constitutional challenge was
    complete and that only oral argument remained.  On the record before us, it appears that the Montagues’ counsel also
    accepted this position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only on October 23, 2007, after two judicial pre-trials
    and 22 months after his December 2005 commitment to inform Crown counsel within
    one week whether the defence would be mounting a challenge to the second search
    warrant, did the Montagues’ counsel raise the possibility of objecting to the
    warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By that time, this jury trial was looming.  A challenge to the second search warrant at
    that stage potentially would have derailed what was anticipated to be a lengthy
    trial.  In those circumstances, there was
    ample justification for the trial judge’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is important to underscore that the basis
    for the proposed attack on the second search warrant was Mr. Montague’s bald
    claim that he had been coerced or “extorted”, while in custody, into revealing
    the location of the secret firearms storage room to the police.  There was no evidentiary foundation for this
    assertion.  Indeed, the transcript from
    Mr. Montague’s bail hearing and the police affidavits to which we have referred
    belie this contention. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The Jury Panel Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Montagues contend that the trial judge violated s.
    632 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> by excusing
    persons from jury service out of their presence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  Section 626(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>626(1) A person who is qualified as a juror
    according to, and summoned as a juror in accordance with, the laws of a
    province is qualified to serve as a juror in criminal proceedings in that
    province.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Ontario, the relevant law is the <i>Juries Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.J.3.  Section 24 provides that when jurors are
    summoned for jury sittings, a judge of the Superior Court of Justice may at any
    time before or during the sittings, “release from or postpone service of any
    number of jurors summoned for the sittings.”  Where jurors have been released from service or their service has been
    postponed, “the remaining jurors constitute the panel”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is precisely what happened at the Montagues’
    trial.  From the transcript, it is clear
    that defence counsel was aware of s. 632 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> but did not appear to be aware of s. 24 of the
    Ontario <i>Juries Act</i>, which is a
    complete answer to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also observe that when defence counsel raised his
    concern about the jurors who had been excused from the panel, the trial judge
    explained the process to him, including the crucial fact that the decision to
    excuse some jurors from the panel was made by him or by Justice Stach, not by a
    court administrator.  This is what s. 24
    of the <i>Juries Act</i> requires.  Finally, the trial judge offered to show
    defence counsel the letters from prospective jurors that formed the basis for
    the trial judge’s exercise of discretion.  He informed counsel that most of the people excused from service “were
    medical situations, but some were holidays”.  There is nothing in the record to support any suggestion that anyone was
    excused from jury service on the basis of partiality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the practice followed by the trial judge in
    this case was entirely consistent with s. 626 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and s. 24 of the Ontario <i>Juries Act</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Crown Closing Address</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Montague contends that Crown counsel made false and
    inflammatory remarks in his closing address to the jury and that the trial
    judge erred by not correcting those remarks.  In particular, Mr. Montague objects to this comment from Crown counsel: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I felt at times, when I’d come into this court and
    hearing some of Mr. Montague’s testimony, like Alice in Wonderland.  I don’t know if you know the story, but Alice
    gets stuck down a rabbit hole and people doing all these crazy and bizarre
    things around her and acting like it’s completely normal, and I felt like that
    when I was listening to Mr. Montague testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When counsel’s impugned comment is considered in
    context, we view it as simply a characterization – perhaps somewhat vivid –
    that reasonably flowed from Mr. Montague’s own testimony about governments,
    war, weapons, resistance and rights.  We are
    not persuaded that Mr. Montague suffered any prejudice from this comment.  The jury acquitted him on all the ‘weapons
    dangerous’ charges to which the impugned remark related.  The jury also acquitted Mr. Montague on a
    host of other charges, thereby undercutting his submission that the remark in
    question would have influenced the jury’s assessment of his credibility.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(5)       <i>Mens

lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Montague raises several grounds of appeal relating to the issue of his intent.  In particular, he submits that the trial
    judge effectively removed from the jury’s consideration the defences of colour
    of right and honest but mistaken belief that his possession of the firearms and
    other prohibited items was lawful.  Mr.
    Montague further submits that the trial judge erred in removing s. 39 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> – defence of personal
    property under a claim of right – from the jury’s consideration.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    would not give effect to these grounds.  The <i>mens rea</i> defences upon which
    Mr.&nbsp;Montague relies do not apply to someone who knowingly violates valid
    legislation under the mistaken belief that the legislation itself is invalid.  That argument was considered and rejected by
    this court in <i>R. v. Klundert</i>, [2004]
    O.J. No. 3515.  As Doherty&nbsp;J.A.
    explained in that case at para. 59, this kind of mistake of law cannot provide
    “a freestanding excuse for the commission of a crime”.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this case, it is apparent from his own evidence that Mr. Montague was not
    trying to obey the law; instead, in protest against various firearms laws and
    regulations with which he disagreed, he was choosing which laws he thought
    should be obeyed.  In sum, he knowingly
    disobeyed the current law.  In these
    circumstances, the defences of honest but mistaken belief and colour of right
    have no application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for s. 39 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the
    trial judge was correct in instructing the jury that s. 39 was irrelevant and
    should not be considered.  Section 39
    provides that persons in peaceable possession of personal property may use
    reasonable force to prevent someone from unlawfully taking their property.  In its essence, s. 39 is a self-defence
    provision.  It has no application here
    since the defence of self-defence was not raised by Mr.&nbsp;Montague.    </span></p>

    the close of evidence, the trial judge amended counts 5, 6, 40 and 42 (all
    s.&nbsp;86(2) charges regarding contraventions of firearms storage regulations)
    to make the indictment conform to the wording of the relevant regulations.  As those regulations define the term
    “unloaded” but not “loaded”, the trial judge amended the four counts in
    question to read “not unloaded” instead of “loaded”. </span></p>

    would not give effect to his submission that the trial judge erred in amending
    the indictment.  The decision to amend was
    discretionary and in making it, the trial judge obviously satisfied himself
    that the amendment occasioned no irreparable prejudice to Mr. Montague.  In particular, it did not alter the essential
    elements of the charges, nor did it affect the way in which Mr. Montague
    conducted his defence. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Generally

    gun if there are two criteria met. The first is the individual must hold a

    reasons as to why he had converted the weapons in issue, “[N]one of them were
    valid reasons under Section 22 of the Firearms Licences regulations”.  It followed, according to the trial judge,
    that even if Mr. Montague were allowed to alter these particular weapons
    pursuant to his business licence, “he could only alter them for specific
    purposes and he wasn’t within those purposes.”</span></p>

    Montague challenges the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum term of
    one-year imprisonment that then existed for the offences of possession of a
    loaded prohibited or restricted firearm with readily accessible ammunition (s.
    95(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>) and
    for altering a firearm to fire automatically (s. 102 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>).  Mr. Montague further submits that a global

    to the nature and severity of his crimes and his degree of moral
    blameworthiness. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We

    95(1)(a) offences would not shock the conscience of the community in the
    circumstances of this case, having regard to the totality principle and the
    number of such offences (nine in total).  The trial judge sentenced Mr. Montague to one year concurrent on each of
    the nine offences.</span></p>

    agree with the trial judge’s analysis and conclusion that the one-year minimum
    sentence did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment in the circumstances of
    this case.  The appellant does not rely,
    in the alternative, on reasonable hypotheticals to support his argument.  See <i>R.

    respect to the 18-month concurrent sentences imposed on the three “alteration”
    charges under s. 102 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> upon which he was convicted, the trial judge considered those offences to be
    the most serious of all the offences Mr. Montague was facing.  In the trial judge’s opinion, Mr. Montague
    made the alterations to prove to <span class=GramE>himself</span>, and perhaps
    others, that he could do so with impunity.  According to the trial judge, his conduct in that regard amounted to “a

    our view, the 18-month concurrent sentences on the alteration offences were both
    measured and fit, having regard to the number of alteration convictions (three)
    and the totality principle.  In the

    sentence under s. 102 could be said to amount to cruel and unusual punishment.  We again note that Mr. Montague does not

    are not persuaded that an 18-month global custodial sentence was manifestly
    unfit or disproportionate to Mr. Montague’s degree of moral blameworthiness.  In so concluding, we have taken into account
    the number of convictions, the seriousness of the offences involved, the threat
    that Mr. Montague’s arsenal of weapons posed to public safety, and his
    deliberate defiance of the law. </span></p>

    position in terms of “as a citizen, he has … the right to express an opinion”,
    “he heard all the evidence”, “[h]e could have an impression of the accused”, it
