    shots being fired in the air early in the morning of February 13, 2005.  The shooting took place outside the Lambada
    night club near St. Clair West and Oakwood Streets in Toronto. Based on
    evidence provided by two eye-witnesses, Mr. Chaudhry a taxi driver, and Mr.

    Chaudhry was driving his taxi that night, and around St. Clair and Oakwood he
    picked up 3 women and a man.   He was
    immediately told to wait while the group talked to some friends outside of the
    taxi.  The man and a woman got out of the
    taxi and then the woman got back in with a different man.  <span style='line-height:200%;'>Chaudhry noticed that the second
    man appeared to be angry.  He then pulled
    out a gun, loaded it and left the taxi.  He started firing shots.  The
    others got out of the taxi.  Chaudhry
    drove the car forward about 50 metres and called 911. </span><span> </span></p>

    Langille, an off-duty firefighter, became involved.  As he and some friends with whom he had been
    socializing left the Lambada night club, he noticed a number of people, about
    12 to 15, milling about.  He was startled
    by the sound of a “pop” and saw a tall black man approach the group.  The man was holding a gun over his head and
    firing shots into the air.  He then
    lowered the gun to chest level, waived it towards the group and said, “Who
    wants some of this?”  Two women and a man
    intervened, subdued him and the four of them left the immediate area of the
    shooting.  </span></p>

    arrived in response to Chaudhry’s 911 <span class=GramE>call</span>.  Chaudhry described the events to the officer.  About 10 minutes later, Chaudhry saw three
    women and a man walking along the sidewalk. He recognized them as the same
    people who had been in his taxi and identified the man to Santeramo as the shooter.  </span></p>

    with friends, he noticed someone walking along the road <span class=GramE>who</span> he recognized as the gunman.  He got out
    of the car and ran back to the area close to the scene of the shooting.  He came upon Santeramo talking to
    Chaudhry.  Langille identified himself
    and then pointed to the man he believed to be the gunman. </span></p>

    shooter from the time when the shooter got into the taxi, talked to people
    outside, pulled out a gun, loaded the gun and left the taxi.  Chaudhry testified that he looked directly at
    the perpetrator as he was waiting for him to close the door of the cab.  </span></p>

    black, tall and thin with a long face and curly black hair.  At first he described the perpetrator’s
    clothing as “black on top”: later he told the police he was wearing a jacket,
    possibly with fur on it. Chaudhry also testified that, while in his cab, the
    shooter was with three women.</span></p>

    perpetrator was confined to the relatively brief encounter outside of the night
    club when he saw the perpetrator come toward him brandishing the gun. He was
    five to ten feet away from the shooter when this was happening.  He then watched as the shooter’s friends
    subdued him. Langille testified that he was sufficiently close to the group to
    tell them they had to get the shooter under control, though he did not think
    they &quot;really heard [him]”.  The
    area, illuminated by street lights, was reasonably well lit.</span></p>

    him the most when he first saw the gunman outside of the night club was his
    hair - afro style hair sticking out of the top and bottom of a toque.  Langille added that he was wearing a black
    jacket open in front and something that looked like a thinner maybe jean jacket
    underneath, and baggy pants.  His clothing
    was baggy.  He was tall and slim.  He was black.  Langille was certain that one of the women
    with the shooter was wearing white pants with a red stripe along the side.</span></p>

    description of the man he noticed from the car.  He was tall and was wearing a puffy jacket and had big afro hair
    sticking out from under a toque.  Furthermore, he was with three other people one of whom was a woman
    wearing white pants with a red stripe along the side.</span></p>

    the area where the appellant was arrested with three other people.  According to Langille, one of the individuals
    arrested was the woman wearing white pants with a red stripe along the side.</span></p>

    tainted by a conversation he had with a police officer just before he testified
    where the officer identified the appellant for him outside of the courtroom.</span></p>

    arriving at the scene, the first person to describe the shooter was
    Chaudhry.  While Santeramo was
    interviewing Chaudhry, Langille ran up and pointed to a person who he
    identified as the gunman.  Chaudhry then
    identified the same person as the shooter.</span></p>

    person he arrested as “male black, puffy hair - - very tall, brown eyes,
    bluejeans, black boots, blue sweater, grey socks, and approximately 6-4 a
    hundred and eighty pound.” A second officer’s notes describe one of the women
    arrested with the appellant as wearing white pants.</span></p>

    that 20 particles of gunshot residue were found on the appellant’s hands,
    shortly after his arrest. An expert in gunshot residue testified about the
    implications of this evidence.  He said
    that if a person discharges a firearm he will likely have gunshot residue on
    his hands.  However, he added that there
    are other ways that gunshot residue can find its way on a person’s hand.  If someone is within 50 feet of a person who
    fires a gun or picks up a recently discharged gun or spent ammunition, residue
    can be transferred to them.  </span></p>

    193, at pp. 219 - 220, the implications of a finding that there has been a
    misapprehension of evidence are intertwined with the analysis as to whether the
    verdict is unreasonable. These analyses are drawn from s. 686 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, <span
class=GramE>c</span>. C-46.  Where
    misapprehension of the evidence is alleged, the court should first consider the
    reasonableness of the verdict: s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)(i).  If the appellant succeeds on this ground, an acquittal
    will be entered.  If the verdict is not
    unreasonable, then the court should determine whether the misapprehension of
    evidence occasioned a miscarriage of justice: s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)(iii).  If so, the conviction must be quashed and, in
    most cases, a new trial ordered.  If the
    appellant cannot show that the verdict was unreasonable or that the error
    produced a miscarriage of justice, the court must consider the question of
    whether the misapprehension of evidence amounted to an error in law: s. 686(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a)(ii).  If so, the
    Crown must demonstrate that the error did not amount to a miscarriage of
    justice: s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii).<u></u></span></p>

    verdict by a judge is unreasonable is well known, and was recently scrutinized
    and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <i>R.
    v. Biniaris, </i><span class=ssl21><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:
200%'>[2000] 1 S.C.R. 381</span></span>.  The test is whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed judge,

    eye-witness identification evidence as being so weak so as to make this a case
    based on nothing but circumstantial evidence, and submits that this almost-useless
    eye-witness identification evidence, bolstered only by inconclusive gunshot
    residue evidence, amounts to a speculative verdict.  He submits, therefore, that on the evidence
    adduced at trial, no reasonable trier of fact, acting judicially, could convict
    him.</span></p>

    with Chaudhry’s evidence.  While
    Chaudhry’s eye-witness testimony required careful scrutiny, it was far from

    alone.  It is bolstered by Langille’s
    testimony.  While Langille’s
    identification evidence may well be considered less reliable than that of
    Chaudhry, given the circumstances under which Langille saw the shooter, the
    trial judge was entitled to consider it together with that of Chaudhry.</span></p>

    description provided by Chaudhry and Langille about the group of people who
    accompanied the gunman, and the fact that the appellant was arrested at the
    scene along with a woman wearing white pants.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Moreover, there is the gunshot residue.  In her reasons for judgment, the trial judge considered
    the gunshot residue as confirmatory: “Finally, when he was arrested, Mr. Carroo
    had gunshot residue on his hands.  While
    there are other ways in which Mr. Carroo could have gotten residue on his
    hands, this evidence does corroborate the eyewitness evidence.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The appellant argues that given
    the evidence of the many ways in which gunshot residue may find its way onto
    the appellant’s hands, the trial judge’s use of that evidence as part of the
    circumstantial evidence to support her conclusion that the Crown had proven
    identification beyond a reasonable doubt was improper.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>I disagree. While it is true, as
    the trial judge acknowledged, that the gunshot residue may have innocently found
    its way onto the appellant’s hands, it forms part of the evidentiary picture available
    for the trial judge’s consideration.  </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The other available explanations
    for the gunshot residue on the appellant’s hands do not make unreasonable the
    trial judge’s use of that evidence as a part of the total evidentiary picture
    in support of the Crown’s case for identification.  </span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The appellant did not testify or
    call evidence.  That left the trial judge
    with no evidence to support an alternative explanation. By contrast, there was
    other evidence which supported the inference that the gunshot residue had
    resulted from the firearm offences in question.   As the Supreme Court has
    explained, “</span><span style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>it is not so much that the failure to testify justifies an
    inference of guilt; it is rather that it fails to provide any basis to conclude
    otherwise</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:

    v. LePage</i> </span><span style='line-height:200%'>(1995),
    95 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), at p. 397. </span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Coupled with the other evidence
    of identity, the trial judge did not err in considering it as some degree of further
    confirmation of the link between the appellant and the shooting.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge failed to address satisfactorily
    evidence that might not have supported the inference that the appellant was the
    shooter.  Particular emphasis was placed
    on the fact that when he was arrested, the appellant was not wearing the
    “puffy” coat that <span style='line-height:
200%;'>Langille</span> had observed earlier.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would
    not accept this argument. Read as a whole the trial judge’s reasons indicate
    that she was alive to the issues in the case, including the evidence as to the
    coat, and that she was satisfied based on the totality of the evidence that,
    despite its weaknesses, there was a sufficient matrix of evidence to support a
    finding that the appellant was the shooter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the
    end, the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end
    of the day, Mr. Carroo was identified by two independent witnesses as the man
    they say saw firing shots that day.  He
    is seen by both these witnesses with three other people.  One witness identifies one of the females who
    appear to know the shooter as wearing white pants and Mr. Carroo is arrested
    with a woman wearing white pants.  In
    addition to that, Mr. Carroo has gunshot residue on his hands.  Taken cumulatively, this evidence satisfies
    me beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Carroo was the man who committed the acts
    described by Mr. Langille and Mr. Chaudhry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the evidence identifying the appellant as the shooter has its weaknesses, as
    identification evidence most often does, there is a substantial degree of consistency
    in the descriptions given by the two eye-witnesses of the assailant’s notable physical
    features and the people with him – particularly the woman wearing the white
    pants with the red stripe along the side.  He was arrested at the scene minutes after the two men saw him shooting
    a gun.  This evidence is bolstered by the
    gunshot residue evidence.  In my view the
    identification evidence meets the reasonableness standard of review: <i>R. v. Francois</i> (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d)
    289 at pp. 295-7.</p>

    trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that she was mistaken as to the substance of
    two material parts of the evidence and those errors play an essential role in
    her reasoning process that resulted in her being satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt on identity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>First, the trial judge erred in finding
    that both Chaudhry and Langille identified the same number of people as being
    in the gunman’s group.  I refer to pp. 12
    – 13 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both of
    the witnesses confirmed that the man they saw had been with three other people.  Mr. Langille testified that the other
    three people were two women and a shorter person he thought was a male.  One of the females was wearing white pants
    with a red stripe.  Mr. Chaudhry
    testified that the group with the shooter consisted of three females.  Both witnesses identified the same group, and
    the group that was arrested consisted of Mr. Carroo and three women, one of
    whom was wearing white pants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that this finding is simply not supported by the evidence –
    in fact the evidence of the two eye-witnesses was not consistent in terms of their
    description of the people in the shooter’s group.  Chaudhry’s testimony concerning the people in
    and around his taxi just before the shooting was that the gunman was with a
    larger group of people.  Langille
    testified that the gunman was with one male and two females.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Second, the appellant submits that
    the trial judge erred in finding that the identifications of the appellant made
    by Chaudhry and Langille at the scene were made independently.  Rather, according to the appellant the
    evidence demonstrates that Chaudhry did not identify the shooter until Langille
    had pointed him out. As Santeramo testified:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>After the
    male [Langille] ran in between my scout car and the cab driver and pointed out
    the suspect, the cab driver did say: “there he is; there he is.”  So he did agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The appellant argues that these two
    errors are significant as the independence of the eye-witnesses in their
    testimony pertaining to their picking the shooter out of the crowd and the
    similarity of the description of the people the gunman was with at the time played
    an important role leading to conviction.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The appellant argues that as a
    result of these errors, he did not receive a fair trial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>While I agree that these two findings
    are material, I am not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>I agree with the Crown that at the
    material time, being when the shots were fired, both Chaudhry and Langille
    spoke of the gunman’s having been with three other people.  The only difference in their evidence relates
    to their account of the male/female composition.  The trial judge considered this discrepancy
    and, in my view, quite reasonably concluded that Langille’s identification of
    one member of the group as male was “an understandable mistake in the
    circumstances.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>With respect to the second alleged
    error, in my view, the record supports the trial judge’s finding that Chaudhry
    and Langille independently identified the appellant as the gunman.  I refer to the manner in which both Chaudhry
    and Santeramo testified to Chaudhry’s identification of the shooter.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Chaudhry testified that when he
    saw the group passing his car, he “recognized them, they were the same three
    girls and the guy who were in my cab.” He also said “...when they passed my car
    to go a little further, I told the police officer that those were the people
    who were in my cab, and this was the guy who shot those fires”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Santeramo testified that, after
    Langille pointed out the suspect, Chaudhry had said “there he is; there he
    is.”  Santeramo’s description of this
    statement was that Chaudhry had “agreed” with Langille, but this does not necessarily
    mean that he merely affirmed Langille’s identification of the shooter.  As I read the evidence, it was open to the
    trial judge to conclude that the two men independently recognized and then concurrently
    reported their independent recognitions to the police.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

  <h2 align=left style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not this
    court’s function to substitute itself for the trial judge.  Rather, it is to conduct an assessment, based
    on a re-examination of the evidence through the lens of judicial experience, in
    order to decide whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed
    trier-of-fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered: see <i>Biniaris</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the
    examination discloses a situation where the appellant was arrested at the scene
    minutes after the shooting and after two eye-witnesses unequivocally identified
    him as the perpetrator not only by his height, the shape of his face, and his afro
    hair style, but also by the people with him.  This identification evidence was reinforced by the gunshot residue
    evidence.  While there were aspects of
    the evidence that had the potential of detracting from the Crown’s case in
    terms of identity, it hardly needs to be said that descriptions provided by
    honest people of unexpected events such as this are rarely, if ever, perfectly recorded
    and recalled.  Such is the view that one invariably
    has through the lens of judicial experience. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion,
