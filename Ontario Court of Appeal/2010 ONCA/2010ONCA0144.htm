lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the issue of mitigation, the trial judge held that the burden of proof was on
    Venture to establish that Link had failed to take reasonable steps to find
    employment and that had he taken such steps, he would have been expected to
    secure a comparable position reasonably adapted to his abilities, thereby
    minimizing the damages sustained.  Because
    Venture did not lead any evidence of comparable employment within or outside
    the steel industry, the trial judge found that Venture had not met the onus of
    establishing that Link had failed to mitigate his damages.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    to Link’s common shares, the trial judge found that the actions purported to be
    taken by Rivas’ letter of May 17, 2005, were of no legal effect.  The trial judge added that Venture did not at
    anytime attempt to purchase Link’s shares at net book value.  He also found that Link’s employment did not
    come to an end until February 20, 2006, when the applicable period of
    reasonable notice expired.  As such, the
    trial judge held that Link still owned his common shares on April 30, 2006 and,
    as a shareholder of Venture, Link would have been entitled to participate in

    argues that the trial judge made three errors relating to the award of damages
    in relation to Link’s common shares:  first,
    he erred in granting relief that was not pleaded; second, he erred in finding
    that Link was still a shareholder on April 30, 2006; and third, he erred in
    awarding damages against Venture under s. 3.4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement.</span></p>

    submits that Link did not plead that he was entitled to the relief the trial
    judge granted, which was an amount equal to nine per cent of the proceeds from
    the sale of Venture to Royal Laser.  Venture also argues that Link did not plead the facts that underlie the
    trial judge’s award.  Those facts are that
    Rivas’ letter of May 17, 2005, had no legal effect and that Link continued to
    own his common shares on April 30, 2006.  </span></p>

    addition, it is Venture’s position that Link’s pleadings were inconsistent with
    the relief granted by the trial judge.  In his amended statement of claim, Link claimed he was entitled to
    payment of the net book value of his shares pursuant to s. 3.6(2)(b) of the Shareholders’
    Agreement.  This claim, Venture argues, was
    premised on the notion that Link could not have still been a shareholder at the
    time of the pleadings and, as such, it was not contemplated that Link would be entitled
    to any portion of the sale proceeds on April 30, 2006.    </span></p>

    is well accepted that the parties to an action are entitled to have a
    resolution of their differences based on the pleadings.  The trial judge cannot make a finding of
    liability and award damages against a defendant on a basis not pleaded in the
    statement of claim because it deprives the defendant of the opportunity to
    address that issue:  <i>Kalkinis (Litigation guardian of) v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1999]

    would not interfere with the trial judge’s award in relation to Link’s common
    shares on the basis of the inadequacy of Link’s pleadings.  In my view, the basis of liability on which the
    trial judge made the award can be supported by the pleadings, albeit with a
    generous and liberal interpretation of those pleadings.  In this case, a generous and liberal
    interpretation of the pleadings is appropriate.  Venture conducted the trial with the evident understanding that Link was
    claiming an amount equal to nine per cent of the sale proceeds for his common
    shares.  Venture was not misled and no
    unfairness resulted from Link’s general pleadings.</span></p>

    started this action by statement of claim issued on June 3, 2005.  He delivered an amended statement of claim on
    August 23, 2005.  His amended statement
    of claim pleaded that he owned nine per cent of the common shares of Venture
    and referred to the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Link pleaded that Venture wrongfully alleged that his termination was
    for cause and that, as a result, the defendants (at the time Rivas and Venture)
    had sought to deprive him of the value of his shareholdings under the Shareholders’
    Agreement.  The amended statement of
    claim set out ss. 3.6(1) and (2) of the Shareholders’ Agreement and pleaded
    that as Link was terminated without cause, he was entitled to the payments
    under s. 3.6(2)(b).  </span></p>

    his shares under the Shareholders’ Agreement, at the time the only provision
    under that agreement that would have been available to determine the purchase
    price of the shares was s. 3.6(2).  The
    statement of claim did not refer to either ss. 3.6(3) or 3.4 which are the sections

    January 3, 2007, Venture and Rivas filed a joint amended amended statement of
    defence and counterclaim.  By this time,
    the sale of Royal Laser had been completed.  In that pleading, Venture maintained its position that Link had been
    dismissed for cause and sought rescission of the Shareholders’ Agreement or,
    alternatively, a declaration that the Shareholders’ Agreement was void <i>ab initio</i>.  Venture pleaded further or in the
    alternative, that by the letter of May 17, 2005, Rivas exercised his option to
    purchase Link’s shares at a price of one dollar and that Link had wrongfully
    refused to deliver those shares.  </span></p>

    25, 2007 (the “reply”).  In para. 14, Link
    denied that any notice provided by Venture served to exercise its option to
    acquire Link’s shares.  Link pleaded that
    as he was terminated without cause, the purchase price was not, as asserted by
    Venture, one dollar.  The reply did not

    generously, the pleadings include the two critical matters that underlie Link’s
    claim that he was entitled to an amount equal to nine per cent of the sale
    proceeds.  The first is that Link was
    still a shareholder on April 30, 2006.  In para. 15 of the amended statement of claim, Link pleaded that the
    defendants sought to deprive him of the rightful value of his shareholdings
    under the Shareholders’ Agreement, albeit at the time he was referring to the
    value pursuant to s. 3.6(2) of that agreement.  In para. 16, Link asserted that he was denied the production of the financial
    statements “as [a] shareholder”.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    para. 14 of the reply, Link denied that any notice provided by Venture served
    to exercise Venture’s option to acquire Link’s shares.  Venture argues that the option to acquire
    Link’s shares was Rivas’ and not Venture’s.  However, in purporting to exercise his option on May 17, 2005, Rivas
    said he was purchasing Link’s shares “through the Corporation” – that being
    Venture.  Thus, while para. 14 of the
    reply may be somewhat unclear, it is obvious that Link was asserting that as of
    January 2007, his shares had not been acquired and he was still a
    shareholder.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Link’s
    claim for an amount equal to nine per cent of the proceeds from the sale of
    Venture also depended on Venture being liable pursuant to s. 3.4 of the Shareholders’
    Agreement.  Venture argues that this was
    an entirely new unpleaded claim and that the pleadings could not support a
    finding of liability on this basis. </span></p>

    disagree.  The second critical matter
    included in the pleadings is that Link was claiming the value of his shares pursuant
    to the Shareholders’ Agreement.  This
    claim is made in para. 31 of the amended statement of claim.  As I said above, Link’s pleadings are
    sufficient to include a claim that he was still a shareholder at the time of
    the sale and that his shares had not been acquired.  Although the pleadings do not make specific
    reference to the sale or to s. 3.4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement, the
    pleadings, in my view, were sufficient in general terms to put Venture on
    notice that Link was asserting a claim for the full value of his shares under
    the Shareholders’ Agreement.  </span></p>

    early as May 19, 2005, Link’s counsel put Venture on notice that Link took the
    position that he had not relinquished his shares.  Link never changed this position and the
    reply reinforced it.  Prior to trial,
    Venture produced the Share Purchase Agreement.  During the opening submissions by Link’s counsel at trial, the Share

    his opening at trial, Link’s counsel made it clear that Link was claiming he
    was entitled to participate in the proceeds of the sale to Royal Laser.  He filed the Shareholders’ Agreement as an
    exhibit and he referred the trial judge to a number of the provisions.  He specifically referred to para. 3.4 (the
    piggyback rights) and said: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>… <span

    referred to ss. 3.4 and 3.6(3).  Both

    was claiming an amount equal to nine per cent of the sale proceeds.  </span></p>

    for Venture then made his opening.  Not only
    did he not object to Link’s claim that he should be awarded a portion of the
    sale proceeds because it had not been pleaded, he joined issue on that
    claim.  He indicated that his position
    was that Link was only entitled to one dollar, but if the court found he was
    dismissed without cause, he should receive only the net book value under s. 3.6(2)(b)
    of the Shareholders’ Agreement.  He
    acknowledged that his position, which would result in an award to Link of approximately
    $697,000, was significantly different than Link’s position.  He said that Link could not recover the
    higher amount because he was no longer a shareholder at the time of the sale.  He summarized as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And
    that really in a nutshell is the first issue, which is, <span class=GramE>were</span> Mr. Link’s shares bought back. And we say, yes, they were, he no longer has

    counsel added that if he was unsuccessful in showing that Link was not entitled
    to participate in the sale proceeds, he would show that Link’s nine per cent
    was worth only $2.4 million, rather than the approximately $3.2 million
    claimed.  The trial judge noted there was
    an $800,000 difference between the parties’ positions.</span></p>

    April 30, 2006, sale and asked questions about the amount a different nine per cent
    shareholder had received.  The above lines
    of questions could only have been relevant to Link’s claim that he was entitled

    an alternative, Venture argues that even if Link adequately pleaded his claim
    to a portion of the sale proceeds, the trial judge erred in concluding that
    Link was still a shareholder on April 30, 2006.  The crux of this argument is that Rivas’ letter of May 17, 2005,
    constituted a valid exercise of Rivas’ option to buy Link’s shares under s.
    3.6(1) of the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Section 3.6(2), Venture submits, constitutes a separate step which sets
    the purchase price for the shares depending on whether or not an employee is
    terminated with or without cause.  The
    shares are purchased and the option is exercised under s. 3.6(1) regardless of
    what price is proposed.  As such, it is Venture’s
    position that the fact that Rivas proposed to pay one dollar in his letter
    exercising the option, rather than the net book value to which Link was
    entitled, does not alter the legal result that Rivas had acquired Link’s
    shares.</span></p>

    do not accept this argument.  In my view,
    the price at which the option is exercised is a critical part of the exercise
    of the option.  Neither Rivas nor Venture
    ever attempted to purchase Link’s shares at a price other than one dollar.  The letter of May 17, 2005, is clear – Link
    would be paid one dollar.  It was never
    paid.  The letter does not address the
    alternative scenario of Link being dismissed without cause.  Link did not accept the one dollar and did
    not render or relinquish his shares.  In
    the ensuing 11 months prior to the sale to Royal Laser, neither Rivas nor
    Venture took the position that if it turned out that Link had been terminated
    without cause, he would be paid the price set out in s. 3.6(2)(b) for his
    shares.  I am satisfied that the letter
    of May 17, 2005, did not constitute a valid purchase of Link’s shares.</span></p>

    submits that the trial judge ignored the pre-conditions to Link having an
    entitlement set out in s. 3.4.  Section
    3.4 requires that Rivas give Link written notice of a pending sale.  Venture notes that at trial, neither Link nor
    Rivas were asked whether Rivas had given Link the required notice.  Venture also argues that, in any event, Link
    is only entitled to relief under s. 3.4 against Rivas and/or the other selling
    shareholders, but not Venture.  Venture,
    it submits, was not a party to the Share Purchase Agreement and did not receive
    any of the proceeds of the sale.  It was

    was a party to the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Venture was also integrally involved in the events that led to Link
    being denied the opportunity to participate in the sale proceeds in breach of
    s. 3.4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement.  In the Share Purchase Agreement, Rivas and the other selling
    shareholders represented that they were selling all of the outstanding shares
    of Venture.  It is obvious they took the
    position that Link was no longer a shareholder and was therefore not entitled
    to notice of the sale under s. 3.4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement, nor was he entitled
    to participate in the sale proceeds.  </span></p>

    and the other selling shareholders could not have excluded Link from the sale
    proceeds but for the wrongful actions of Venture.  Venture wrongfully terminated Link for causes
    that were held to be unfounded.  Doing so
    allowed Rivas to claim to purchase Link’s common shares for one dollar.  In his letter of May 17, 2005, Rivas purported
    to purchase the shares “through the Corporation”.  The directors of Venture followed up by passing
    the resolution of October 28, 2005, purporting to purchase for cancellation
    Link’s shares as of May 17, 2005, for one dollar.  This resolution was legally ineffective, but
    enabled Rivas and the other selling shareholders to take the position in the Share
    Purchase Agreement that they were selling all of the shares of Venture. </span></p>

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            Issue #2 - The Dividend Award</span></h3>

    trial judge awarded Link $229,411.76 representing <span class=GramE>nine  per</span> cent of the total dividend paid out
    on the Class B preferred shares.  Venture
    argues that the trial judge erred in making this award for two reasons: first, Link
    was not entitled to exercise his option to purchase the Class B preferred
    shares until after July 15, 2009, and until that option was exercised, Link had
    no right to any dividends on the Class B shares; and second, in any event, Link
    did not plead that he was entitled to the dividend awarded.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    agree that the trial judge erred in awarding nine per cent of a dividend paid on
    the Class B preferred shares.  As Venture
    points out, Link’s interest in the Class B shares was an option to purchase.  The Option Agreement specifically provides
    that Link would have no rights to receive dividends until the option was
    exercised.  The option could only be
    exercised by Link after July 15, 2009.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While there was evidence that Rivas received a
    dividend during the period that Link still owned his common shares, it is not
    clear on what shares this dividend was issued. Rivas testified that the
    dividend was issued on his common shares; however, I note that s. 2.4 of the
    Shareholders’ Agreement provides that the common shareholders will not receive
    any dividends or other consideration on their shares until all preferred shares
    of Venture have been repurchased or otherwise cancelled.  From examining the Share Purchase Agreement
    it appears that immediately prior to the sale to Royal Laser there were
    outstanding preferred shares.  In the
    end, I am unable to determine what happened with respect to the dividend other
    than that Link was not entitled to a dividend on his Class B share option. </p>

    payment. Accordingly, I would set aside the trial judge’s award in this
    respect.</p>

    argues that the trial judge erred in failing to reduce the damages he awarded
    to Link for wrongful dismissal as a result of Link’s failure to mitigate those
    damages.  The trial judge allowed Link
    damages for a 12-month notice period without deduction.  Link testified and the trial judge found that
    Link took no steps to look for another position until after February 21, 2006 –
    one year after his dismissal.  Link
    testified that he did not take any steps because he was concerned about violating
    the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of the Shareholders’
    Agreement and jeopardizing his claim for the value of his share of Venture.  These provisions prohibit Link from competing
    or soliciting while he is a shareholder of Venture and for periods of 12 and 18
    months, respectively, after he is no longer a shareholder. </span></p>

    concluding that he should not make a deduction from the award of damages for
    pay in lieu of notice and benefits, the trial judge had regard to the relevant
    authorities and legal principles.  He
    pointed out that there was an onus on Venture to establish that Link failed to
    take reasonable steps to mitigate his damages and that had he done so, he would
    have been expected to secure a comparable position reasonably adapted to his
    abilities.  Because Venture did not lead any
    evidence about the availability of suitable employment, the trial judge
    concluded that Venture had not met the second prong of the test set out above.</span></p>

    #4 - New Trial on Non-Competition Clause </span></h3>

    argues that if the trial judge’s finding that Link was still a shareholder on April
    30, 2006, is not set aside, this court should order a new trial to address
    whether Venture is entitled to a set-off from the damages award because of what
    it alleges was Link’s breach of his non-competition, and potentially
    non-solicitation, obligations.  The
    thrust of this argument is that if this court holds that Link was still a
    shareholder in August 2006, he breached the non-competition clause by accepting
    employment with Venture’s competitor.  As
    this set-off argument was not addressed at trial, Venture argues that this
    court should order a new trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    do not accept this argument.  It was
    Venture’s position throughout the trial that Link was terminated with cause and
    that Link had ceased being a shareholder as of May 17, 2005.  The trial judge rejected both positions.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Venture’s
    set-off argument appears to be an attempt to take advantage of its own
    wrongdoings. The argument depends on a finding that Venture terminated Link
    without cause and breached the Shareholders’ Agreement.  It also ties into the fact that Link did not
    sell his shares at the time of the sale to Royal Laser as he was entitled to do
    under s. 3.4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement.  While Link continued to be a shareholder in August 2006 when he took
    employment, a court might be reluctant to enforce the non-competition clause in
    light of the positions that Venture had wrongfully asserted in the previous 18
    months. </span></p>

    said<span class=GramE>,</span> I do not find it necessary to determine the
    merits of the set-off argument or to remit it for a new trial.  The set-off argument was available to Venture
    at trial.  Venture was aware at the time
    of trial that Link was asserting that he continued to be a shareholder of
    Venture after April 30, 2006.  Venture
    also knew at trial that Link had obtained employment with Precision Metals in
    August 2006. The implications were clear.  If Link succeeded in his argument, it was open to Venture to argue as an
    alternative position that Link, in taking his new employment, had breached the
    non-competition and perhaps the non-solicitation provisions in the Shareholders’
    Agreement, thereby entitling Venture to a set-off for any damages it sustained.</span></p>
