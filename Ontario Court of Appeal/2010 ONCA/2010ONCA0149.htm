  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal pits a retroactive amendment to the <i>Retail Sales Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    R.31 (RSTA) against the effect of an earlier court declaration.  After the appellant Procter &amp; Gamble Inc.
    (P&amp;G) had obtained a declaration of the Superior Court of Justice on
    August 30, 2006 that it was exempt from retail sales taxes in the circumstances,
    the legislature amended the RSTA and made the amendment retroactive to May 7,
    1997.  P&amp;G appeals from the February
    27, 2009 decision of the motion judge that the subsequent retroactive amendment
    applies to P&amp;G for the previously appealed periods despite the declaration
    it obtained earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:200%;'><span lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>History</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G rents wooden pallets from a third party, CHEP
    Canada Inc. (CHEP) to ship packaged consumer goods (loaded onto the pallets
    and shrink-wrapped) to its large-store customers.  After delivery of the consumer goods, CHEP
    collects the wooden pallets directly from P&amp;Gs customers, and charges
    P&amp;G for their use.  CHEP then uses
    the pallets again, providing them not necessarily to P&amp;G, but to any of its
    many customers.  P&amp;G and the
    respondent, the Minister of Finance (Minister) have long disputed whether
    P&amp;G must pay retail sales tax on the payments it makes to CHEP for the
    lease of the pallets.  The dispute, at
    this stage, relates in large measure to whether the pallets fall within the
    definition of a returnable container in the RSTA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to set out the course of the long
    simmering dispute or to appreciate the merits of the tax issues.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Suffice it to say that P&amp;G paid the tax
    for many years and later made applications for refunds on the basis that it had
    paid the tax in error.  The Minister refused
    its applications for refunds and P&amp;G filed objections under s. 24 of the
    RSTA.  When the Minister confirmed the
    assessments, P&amp;G filed appeals under s. 27 of the RSTA.  P&amp;G had commenced its first Notice of
    Appeal on January 9, 2006 seeking a tax refund for the period of December 1,
    1999 to September 17, 2003.  P&amp;G
    commenced its second Notice of Appeal on July 26, 2007, seeking a tax refund
    for the period between January 29, 2003 and May 16, 2005.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, P&amp;G brought an Application under Rule
    14 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure,</i> R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (Rule 14 Application) for a declaration that the retail sales tax it had been paying on the
    wooden pallets since December 1, 1999 was not payable.  On August 30, 2006 the Superior Court of
    Justice granted the declaration.  The
    declaration was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal on November 16, 2007.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  The Minister filed and then abandoned an
    application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, the government responded with legislative
    action  it amended the RSTA on May 14, 2008 by broadening the definition of
    returnable container.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  The amending statute provided that the
    amended definition shall be deemed to have come into force on May 7, 1997.  Subsequently, P&amp;G commenced third and
    fourth Notices of Appeal on July 4, 2008 relating to refunds for later periods.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appeals under the RSTA proceed as actions in the
    Superior Court of Justice.  On October
    16, 2008, the Minister brought a motion before the Superior Court of Justice in
    the first two P&amp;G assessment appeals to determine a question of law before
    trial pursuant to Rule 21.01(a) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  The Minister
    sought a determination as to whether the retroactive amendment applied to P&amp;G.
    On February 27, 2009, the motion judge found that the retroactive amendment
    applied to P&amp;G.   P&amp;G appeals the motion judges decision to
    this court.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties have agreed that this case, while
    technically involving only the first two of P&amp;Gs assessment appeals under
    the RSTA appeal process, will apply to all four outstanding appeals.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-US>ii.   P&amp;G</span>s Rule 14<span lang=EN-US> Declaration </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;Gs Rule 14 Application was brought under rule 14.05(3<span
class=GramE>)(</span>d).  The rule allows
    an applicant to claim as relief the determination of rights that depend on ...
    the interpretation of a statute.  The
    facts asserted by P&amp;G were not disputed by the Minister.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary relief that P&amp;G claimed on its Rule 14
    Application was a declaration that it did not fall within the statutory definition
    of a purchaser of the pallets.  Its
    claim for a declaration in this regard was summarized by the application judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]hen P&amp;G rents
    CHEP pallets, it acquires them for the purpose of resale and, as such, is not a
    purchaser of the pallets under the <i>RSTA</i> and therefore retail sales tax
    is not payable; ...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found against P&amp;G in this
    regard.  He concluded that P&amp;G is a
    taxable purchaser of the pallets within the meaning of the RSTA.  In each of the three assessment appeals filed
    after the application judges decision, P&amp;G again argues that it is not a
    purchaser of the pallets. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its Rule 14 Application P&amp;G addressed the
    definition of a returnable container as alternative relief.  If found to be a purchaser of the pallets
    under the RSTA, P&amp;G sought a declaration that the purchase was nonetheless
    tax-exempt under s.7(1)41 of the RSTA as the purchase [was] for the purpose of
    attaching or incorporating the pallets into tangible personal property for the
    purpose of sale.  If s. 7(1)41 applied
    the pallets would not be taxable as returnable containers.  Returnable container was defined in s. 1(1)
    of the RSTA as a container that is intended to be returned to be refilled by a
    manufacturer.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this alternative claim for relief, the application
    judge found in P&amp;Gs favour.  The
    application judge reasoned that pallets were not returned to P&amp;G but to
    CHEP.   He said: The current definition
    does not say returned to be reused by any supplier, but returned to be
    refilled by a manufacturer.  Consequently he granted P&amp;G a declaration that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Procter &amp; Gamble is
    exempt from retail sales tax when it acquires the pallets from CHEP Canada
    Inc., by virtue of s. 7(1)41 of the <i>Retail
    Sales Tax Act</i>, because the pallets are purchased for the purpose of being
    attached to or incorporated into the Consumer Goods for the purposes of
    sale by P&amp;G; and, that the exception to s. 7(1)41 for a returnable
    container does not apply to the pallets because they do not fall within the
    definition of returnable container as set out in section 1(1) of the Act. </p>

    current definition of returnable container did not remain so.  The subsequent retroactive amendment provided
    that a returnable container does not have to be returned directly to the
    manufacturer, but includes containers intended to be returned, <u>directly or
    indirectly,</u> to a person for reuse in the packaging, storage or shipping of
    tangible personal property (emphasis added).  The Ministers motion sought a determination that the amended definition
    applies to P&amp;G.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the motion judge, P&amp;G took the position that
    by virtue of the declaration it had already obtained, the retroactive
    amendments do not apply to its claims for refunds and the determination of its
    outstanding statutory appeals.  The
    Minister took the position that the amendments conclusively determined both.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge misapprehended that P&amp;Gs claim
    for refunds dated back to May 7, 1997.  He inferred that, by making the amendment retroactive to that date, the legislature
    showed it was keenly aware of the claim of P&amp;G.  The Minister concedes the motion judge was
    mistaken about this.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also attached significance to the
    following comment this court made in its reasons dismissing the Ministers
    appeal of the Rule 14 declaration:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unfortunate though that
    may be from the Ministers perspective, it can easily be rectified by amendment
    should the legislature see fit to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In finding that P&amp;G cannot be considered to have
    had settled expectations, the motion judge also alluded to the Ministers
    longstanding position that retail sales tax was payable on the amounts
    manufacturers paid for the pallets use, and the rationale for the amendment as
    set out in Chapter III to the <i>2008
    Ontario Budget: Growing a Stronger Ontario.  </i>The budget statement<i> </i>stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Amendments are proposed
    to the <i>Retail Sales Tax Act</i>,
    effective May 7, 1997, in response to a recent court interpretation. The
    proposed amendments would confirm Ontarios longstanding requirement for
    persons to pay RST on purchases of containers and other packaging, storage and
    shipping items that are intended to be returned for reuse in the packaging,
    storage or shipping of goods...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was satisfied that the Legislature has
    turned its mind to the effect of retroactivity and expressed its
    intention.  He concluded that the
    Statute was validly amended and validly expressed and applied to P&amp;G.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G submits that the motion judge committed the
    following errors in arriving at his conclusion that the retroactive amendment
    applied to its claims for tax refunds:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i) <span class=GramE>he</span> relied on the
    effective date of the retroactive amendment May 7, 1997, to infer a legislative
    intent to address P&amp;Gs declaration;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii) <span class=GramE>he</span> relied on
    statements by the Minister about the purpose of the relevant portions of the
    Budget Act to infer a legislative intent to address P&amp;Gs declaration; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iii) <span class=GramE>he</span> concluded that
    P&amp;G did not have any settled expectations under its declaration; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iv) he did not apply what P&amp;G says is an
    overarching presumption that retroactive legislation even though generally
    applicable does not take away adjudicated rights unless there is a specific
    legislative intent to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Due to concessions, several issues have fallen
    away.  As mentioned, the Minister
    concedes that the motion judge erred by drawing a connection between the May 7,
    1997 effective date of the retroactive amendment and P&amp;Gs claims for
    refunds.  P&amp;Gs claims for refunds
    date back only to December 1, 1999.  The
    date May 7, 1997 was chosen because the definition of returnable container
    that was amended by the retroactive provision was originally enacted on May 7,
    1997.  Nor does the budget statement
    indicate a legislative intent to apply the retroactive amendment specifically
    to P&amp;G.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister submits it does not matter whether the legislature
    indicated that it intended the amendment to apply specifically to P&amp;G
    because the declaration that P&amp;G obtained on its Rule 14 Application did
    not give it the type of vested property right that would remain unaffected by
    a subsequent retroactive legislation; i.e., a vested right to a specific refund
    of tax.  The declaration merely provided
    an interpretation of the law as it existed at the time.  Since the retroactive amendment, the law to
    be applied, as it existed at the time, is now different.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this case is about the interaction of the Rule 14
    declaration and the RSTA, it is appropriate to begin by examining both. The
    nature of the relief P&amp;G obtained on its application before the Superior
    Court of Justice is best understood against the background of the RSTA.  Therefore, I begin with an overview of the
    RSTA.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:200%;'><span
lang=EN-US>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Overview of the RSTA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The RSTA imposes a retail sales tax in Ontario and creates
    a regime for the collection of the tax.  The tax is payable by every purchaser of tangible personal property,
    with exceptions.  The RSTA obliges
    vendors to collect the tax and remit it to the Minister.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general purpose of the RSTA is to generate tax
    revenue and many of its provisions reflect the statutes strong tilt in favour
    of tax collection.  To illustrate, s.
    18(1) provides that when the Minister makes an assessment, such assessed
    amount shall thereupon be deemed to be the tax collected by the vendor.  Section 18(8) deems any assessment of tax
    issued by the Minister to be valid and binding on the taxpayer (unless varied
    or vacated on objection or appeal) and subject to reassessment.  Section 18(9) requires taxpayers to pay to the
    Minister any taxes in dispute pending determination of an objection or
    appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A taxpayer who disagrees with an assessment of tax may
    file an objection under s. 24 of the RSTA.  An objection is an administrative review of the assessment.  If the Minister dismisses the objection and
    confirms the assessment or statement of tax, the taxpayer may appeal to the
    Superior Court of Justice under s. 25 of the RSTA.  Though recourse to the Superior Court of
    Justice is termed an appeal, the appeal proceeds as an action.  The jurisdiction that s. 27(3) gives the Superior
    Court of Justice in disposing of an appeal includes vacating or varying the
    assessment.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In response to assessment of the disputed tax, P&amp;G
    followed the process provided in the RSTA for resolving disputes.  It made four separate applications for
    refunds of the disputed amounts that it remitted to the Minister, as required
    by the RSTA.  In each case the Minister
    disallowed the refund claim by way of a Statement of Disallowance.  P&amp;G filed an objection against each
    disallowance and in each case the Minister confirmed the disallowance.  When the objection was rejected by the
    Minister, P&amp;G filed a notice of appeal in the Superior Court of Justice in
    each case.  All four of these assessment
    appeals remain outstanding before the Superior Court of Justice.  The Superior Court of Justice, upon
    determining those assessment appeals, may vacate or vary the disputed
    assessments and order the Minister to pay the claimed refunds to P&amp;G.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Relief under Rule 14</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P&amp;G recognizes that on its Rule 14
    Application it did not obtain a judgment it could execute upon to obtain the
    refunds.  P&amp;G readily acknowledges
    that it must file its Rule 14 declaration in the RSTAs statutory assessment
    appeals where P&amp;G asserts the declaration would have binding effect and
    result in an order made on the assessment appeals that the refunds be paid.  This acknowledgment heeds the deeming effect
    of s. 18(8) of the RSTA.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G candidly explained that it resorted to Rule 14
    while its objections and appeals were pending because the RSTA statutory
    process is controlled by the Minister and proceeds slowly.  P&amp;G pointed to s. 26 of the RSTA as an
    example.  Section 26 gives the Minister
    180 days to reply to a Notice of Appeal, and even then the taxpayer must obtain
    a court order before a consequence flows from the Ministers failure to file a
    reply.  P&amp;G submits that a Rule 14 Application
    allows a taxpayer to obtain a declaration that can be filed in its statutory assessment
    appeals, thus speeding up the determination of the issues and shortening the
    time to obtain a refund of disputed tax.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, while P&amp;G recognized that it could not obtain
    an order vacating the assessments and requiring the Minister to pay to it the
    claimed refunds on its Rule 14 Application, it brought the application
    intending to file the result in its assessment appeals.  P&amp;G describes filing the declaration in
    the statutory assessment appeal as a purely mechanical exercise.  It submits that once the declaration is
    filed, the Superior Court of Justice determining the assessment appeals is compelled
    to grant judgment in accordance with it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept that filing the Rule 14 declaration in
    the assessment appeals process is a purely mechanical exercise that would
    dictate the result of those appeals.  The
    assessment appeals process to vacate or vary assessments is imposed by the legislature.  Within the large administrative scheme for
    the collection of retail sales tax, the determination of an individual
    assessment may have significant policy and revenue generating implications for
    the system as a whole.  The statutory
    process expressly allows the Minister the time necessary to consider the issues
    raised by an individual taxpayers assessment appeal and to formulate a
    response.  Section 18(8) of the RSTA
    makes evident the legislatures intent that assessments are to be considered
    valid and binding until varied or vacated by the statutory process.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time, a declaration of the court is a binding
    determination of what is declared.  Ordinarily, a declaration of the court interpreting the RSTA would bind
    the parties on an assessment appeal.  The
    declaration of the application judge that P&amp;G is a purchaser of the
    pallets is a good example.  There is no
    apparent reason why it would not be binding on the parties in P&amp;Gs assessment
    appeals.  As an aside, it seems
    inconsistent that while arguing the binding effect of the declaration, P&amp;G has
    raised the issue whether it is a purchaser of the pallets in its assessment
    appeals filed after the court made its declaration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the declaration concerning P&amp;Gs
    alternative relief is a final and binding determination.  The basis of that declaration, set out in the
    declaration itself, was that the pallets do not fall within the definition of
    returnable container as set out in section 1(1) of the Act.  That declaration was, is, and remains a
    binding interpretation of the definition of returnable container construed by
    the application judge.  However, I agree
    with the Minister that it is an interpretation that does not matter
    anymore.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superior Court determining P&amp;Gs assessment
    appeals will face the question of the meaning of a returnable container as
    used by the RSTA.  Absent the amendment,
    the declaration would have been a binding interpretation of that term.  However, given the retroactive amendment, when
    the meaning of a returnable container arises before the court determining the
    assessment appeals, it will be called upon to interpret and apply a statutory
    definition different than the one interpreted by the application judge.  The application judges declaration, if filed
    in the assessment appeals, would not provide a binding interpretation of the
    definition of returnable container which, by virtue of the retroactive
    amendment, is deemed to have been in effect since May 7, 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G recognizes that the new definition would apply
    to the determination of the outstanding objections and statutory assessment
    appeals of other taxpayers.  It unequivocally
    concedes that the amendment is valid retroactive legislation of general
    application.  P&amp;G submits, however, that
    there is an exception to the general application of valid retroactive
    legislation for adjudicated rights.  The fact that it obtained the Rule 14 declaration sets it apart from
    other taxpayers and gives it the right to have its assessment appeals
    determined according to the repealed definition of a returnable container, as
    there is no indication of a clear legislative intent that the retroactive
    amendment applies specifically to it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G derives the proposition that adjudicated
    rights are excepted from the general application of valid retroactive
    legislation from comments made in a number of Canadian, British and Australian
    cases.  None of these cases is authority
    for such a proposition.  Each case turns
    on its own facts and the specific words of the particular statutory provision
    at issue.  The cases reverberate with the
    established proposition of statutory interpretation that a statute will not be
    given retroactive effect unless the legislative intent that it <span
class=GramE>have</span> retroactive effect is clearly expressed.  It is an entirely different proposition that
    a statute, already recognized to have retroactive effect, should not apply to a
    litigant who has obtained a declaration interpreting the former law.  I do not intend to embark on a detailed
    review of all the cases P&amp;G relied upon.  I shall comment on some of the most pertinent ones.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the strongest authority relied on by P&amp;G is
    the English Court of Appeal decision in <i>R.
    v. Customs and Excise Commissioners</i>.  That case, like this one, involved the tax authoritys efforts to apply
    a retroactive amendment to the tax statute.  In deciding the case in favour of the taxpayer, the court stated If
    Parliament wishes to legislate that prior judicial determinations can be
    overthrown in this way, especially in a statutory context which is all about
    the making of claims, <span class=GramE>then</span> in my judgment it must say
    so expressly, as it could easily have done. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This language, considered in isolation, seems to
    provide support for P&amp;Gs proposition at first glance.  But the facts of the case are quite different.  Unlike this case which involves a Rule 14
    declaration, the taxpayers application for a refund proceeded through the
    statutory process for resolving tax disputes, and was allowed by the tax tribunal.  The taxing authority did not appeal the tax
    tribunals decision in favour of the taxpayer within the statutorily allowed
    period.  The refund was actually paid to
    the taxpayer.  Then the taxing authority
    sought to reclaim the refund relying on the retroactive amendment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key distinction I see is that after the period to
    appeal the decision of the tax tribunal that had jurisdiction to order the
    refund elapsed and the refund was paid to the taxpayer, there was no longer an
    outstanding tax question or assessment proceeding in which the retroactive amendment
    could be applied.  Here, the assessment appeals
    and the question whether the assessment should be vacated or varied are still
    outstanding.</p>

    in <i>Canada <span class=SpellE>Trustco</span> Mortgage Co.</i>  The case involved the
    interpretation of the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in s. 245 of the <i>Income Tax Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, <span
class=GramE>c</span>. 1 (5th Supp.).  The
    Tax Court had allowed the taxpayers appeal of the Ministers assessment for
    the tax year 1997, vacated the assessment and remitted the matter to the
    Minister for reassessment.  The Minister
    appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada after losing in the Federal Court of
    Appeal.  Before the appeal was heard,
    certain sub-sections of s. 245 were amended, though the statement of the GAAR
    itself in s. 245(2) was not amended.  The
    amending provision provided that it applied with respect to transactions
    entered into after September 12, 1988.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of their reasons for the unanimous court, <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> C.J. and Major J. set aside any possible
    relevance of the amendment to the appeal in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A recent amendment to
    s. 245 (<i>Budget Implementation Act</i>, <i>2004, No. 2</i>, S.C. 2005, c. 19, s. 52)
    has no application to the judgments under appeal. Although this amendment was
    enacted to apply retroactively, it cannot apply at this stage of appellate
    review, after the parties argued their cases and the Tax Court judge rendered
    his decision on the basis of the GAAR as it read prior to the amendment.
    Furthermore, even if this amendment were to apply, it would not warrant a
    different approach to the issues on appeal. In our view, this amendment to s.
    245 serves <i>inter alia</i> to make it
    clear that the GAAR applies to tax benefits conferred by Regulations enacted
    under the <i>Income Tax Act</i>. The Tax
    Court judge in the instant case proceeded on this assumption, which was not
    challenged by the parties in submissions before us.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The significant difference is that P&amp;G has not
    obtained, as did the taxpayer in <i>Canada
    Trustco Mortgage Co.,</i> a decision vacating and setting aside the disputed
    tax assessments.  Here, the situation
    remains that the assessments of P&amp;G are deemed to be valid and binding
    despite any error because they have not been varied or vacated by an objection
    or appeal under the RSTA.   I do not think that the Supreme Court in this <i>dictum</i>, which is remote from the issue
    decided in the case, introduced a new general principle to be applied in all
    cases.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Zadvorny </i>is a
    decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which P&amp;G submits drew a
    distinction between retroactively changing a law of general application and <span
class=GramE>legislating</span> the extinguishment of a judgment.  The case involved an action by a plaintiff
    injured in a motor vehicle against the other drivers insurer. While the appeal
    was pending in the Court of Appeal, the legislature enacted a retroactive
    amendment restricting an insurers liability to substantially less than the
    judgment the successful plaintiff recovered at trial.  In the course of dismissing the insurers
    appeal, the majority of the court made remarks that P&amp;G relies upon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to note that the divided court refused
    to allow the insurer to amend its Notice of Appeal to rely on the retroactive
    amendment to the statute.  The reason was
    the appeal had been much delayed as the size of the court was reduced.  Cameron J.A., with Tallis J.A. concurring,
    reasoned that if the appeal had come on for hearing promptly it would have been
    decided before the amendment was enacted.  The plaintiff, he said, should not be adversely affected because of the
    delay that resulted from the reduction of the size of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority went on to express the <i>dictum</i> that if they allowed the insurer
    to rely upon the amendment they would not have given it effect in this case in
    any event.  Cameron J.A. wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[E]<span
class=SpellE>ven</span> if the amendment had been permitted, we would not have
    allowed the appeal. To change a law of general application, retroactively, is
    one thing; to legislate the extinguishment of a judgment is another. To satisfy
    us that the Legislature intended to deprive the respondent of his judgment...would
    take the clearest of language. We are not saying the power to legislate a
    plaintiff out of the fruits of a successful suit does not exist....If the
    Legislature had intended to do that, we are quite confident it would have used
    more express language than what appears in the general amending enactment in
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This <i>dictum</i> does provide support for the appellants position.  It does not, however, establish it.  The facts and statutory context in <i>Zadvorny</i> are completely different.  Mr. Zadvorny held an entered court judgment
    for an express sum of money, while P&amp;Gs assessments remain valid and
    binding despite any error, by virtue of s. 18(8) of the RSTA. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some of the cases P&amp;G relies on, the legislation
    at issue was found not to have retroactive application.  In such a situation the fact that the legislation
    does not affect the result of an earlier court case does not assist
    P&amp;G.  The decision of the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal in <span class=SpellE><i>Hornby</i></span><i> Island Trust
    Committee v. <span class=SpellE>Stormwell</span></i> (1988), 53 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    435 is an example.  It involved municipal
    bylaws and a claimed non-conforming use.  The court found the legislation at issue was retrospective and not
    retroactive.  The legislation at issue in
    this case is retroactive, as P&amp;G recognizes.  The decision does not illustrate that a
    person who has adjudicated rights is sheltered from a retroactive statute
    that applies generally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several of the cases that P&amp;G cited merely stress
    that clear language is required to rebut the presumption against retroactive
    application of legislation.  These are of
    no assistance because the language in this case is accepted to be specific
    enough to rebut the presumption.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Others, including <i>Canada
    v. Gibson, </i>2005 FCA 180, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A.
    No. 326, and <i>C.H.S. v. Alberta (Director
    of Child Welfare)</i> <span lang=EN-US>(2008), 452
    A.R. 66 (Q.B.), </span>are cases where the legislation at issue expressly
    indicated that it applied to earlier decisions or judgments of a court.  The legislation in these cases was found to
    have retroactive effect.  The decisions
    do not state that absent such language the legislation will not retroactively
    apply to the earlier results of court decisions.  The courts did not analyze the situation as
    one where legislation could be generally retroactive but still would not apply
    to prior court decisions.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Conceptual Difficulties with
    P&amp;Gs Proposition </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The authorities that P&amp;G cited do not establish the
    proposition that it asserts; i.e., adjudicated rights are always exempted
    from the general application of retroactive legislation unless there is a clear
    legislative intent to apply specifically to them.  Moreover, I do not think it would be a
    positive development of the law to endorse the proposition.  The category of adjudicated rights is
    amorphous.  Many different kinds of rights
    are adjudicated.  Whether retroactive
    legislation applies to a particular adjudicated right must surely depend on the
    wording of the legislation and the nature of the right affected.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another difficulty with P&amp;Gs proposition is that
    an individual may have an interest, acquired other than by adjudication, that
    is identical to a right another individual has won by adjudication.  There is no good reason to differentiate
    between identical interests, exempting one from the application of retroactive
    legislation but not the other.  It makes
    better sense to treat rights and interests according to their content and the specific
    terms of the retroactive legislation at issue in any case.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the temporal scope of exemption that
    P&amp;G claims from the application of the retroactive amendment lacks logical demarcation.  It concedes that the amendment will apply to
    it prospectively, but does not present a sound conceptual framework for determining
    precisely when it would begin to apply.  P&amp;G
    does not limit its claimed exemption to the one refund for which it had filed
    an appeal at the time the declaration was granted.  It claims the same exemption for the three
    appeals filed afterwards.  It does not
    differentiate between the two appeals it filed before the amendment was enacted
    and the two appeals it filed after.  Its
    fourth appeal covers a period ending September 30, 2007, well before the
    retroactive amendment was enacted on May14, 2008.   Its position in this case would have the
    amendment apply to it for the period September 30, 2007 to May 14, 2008, which would
    involve a retroactive application of the amendment for that period.  The basis for these distinctions is not
    discernable and was not explained.  Moreover,
    given that the binding nature of a declaration of the court interpreting a
    statute is not limited to the parties who were before the <span class=GramE>court,</span> P&amp;G does not explain why only it and not other taxpayers can rely on the
    declaration.  The Ministers agreement
    that this appeal will govern all four assessment appeals does not excuse
    P&amp;G from persuading the court the concept it advocates is sound.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In deciding whether the rights of P&amp;G under the
    declaration should be protected from legislative interference absent the
    clearest of language, I see no reason to depart from the traditional concept of
    vested rights.  P&amp;G did not argue that
    the Rule 14 declaration gave it a vested right to the tax refunds.  It is evident it did not give P&amp;G an
    immediate and enforceable right to payment of the claimed refunds.  The declaration gave P&amp;G the right to
    have the application judges interpretation of the definition of returnable
    container applied in its assessment appeals.  That interpretation is no longer relevant as the statutory definition
    that must be applied was not considered by the application judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt P&amp;G had hoped, by departing the tax arena
    and obtaining a declaration interpreting the RSTA, that it could use the
    declaration to its advantage in its assessment appeals. The law, however, can
    change, as Dickson J. pointed out in  <i>Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. M.N.R</i>.,
    [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271 at pp. 282-283:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No one has
    a vested right to continuance of the law as it stood in the past; in tax law it
    is imperative that legislation conform to changing social needs and
    governmental policy. A taxpayer may plan his financial affairs in reliance on
    the tax laws remaining the same; he takes the risk that the legislation may be
    changed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The mere
    right existing in the members of the community or any class of them at the date
    of the repeal of a statute to take advantage of the repealed statute is not a
    right accrued...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that P&amp;G regards the result as
    unfair, Major J. explained at some length in <i>British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.,</i><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black;'> </span>[2005] 2 S.C.R. 473<i> </i>that retroactive legislation often
    appears unjust.  He wrote as follows at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 74-75:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>The first is <i>Air
    Canada </i>[<i>v. British Columbia</i>, </span>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1161]<span
style='color:black'>. In it, a majority of this Court affirmed the
    constitutionality of 1981 amendments to the <i>Gasoline Tax Act, 1948</i>, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. <span class=GramE>162, that</span> retroactively taxed certain companies in the airline industry. The amendments
    were meant strictly to defeat three companies claims, brought in 1980, for
    reimbursement of gasoline taxes paid between 1974 and 1976, the collection of which was <i>ultra vires</i> the
    legislature of British Columbia. ...</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The second is <span class=SpellE><i>Authorson</i></span><i> v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 40, 2003 SCC 39, in
    which this Court unanimously upheld a provision of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1, aimed
    specifically at defeating certain disabled veterans claims, the merits of
    which were undisputed, against the federal government.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While these outcomes may appear unfair or unjust, it is
    the legislatures prerogative to determine tax policy, not this courts.  Given the clear intent of the legislature to retroactively
    amend the RSTA, this court must give it effect.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>V.        CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G has filed notices of appeal seeking to vacate
    the Ministers assessments under the RSTA refusing refunds of taxes paid by
    P&amp;G since December 1, 1999 that P&amp;G had claimed on the basis that the
    pallets on which its goods are shipped to its customers are not returnable
    containers.  Those appeals remain to be
    determined.  On May 14, 2008 the legislature
    enacted an amended definition of returnable container.  P&amp;G concedes that the presumption that
    the amended definition would apply only prospectively is displaced by the clear
    words of the amending statute that it shall be deemed to have come into force
    on May 7, 1997.   The amended definition
    is deemed to apply retroactively to the calculation of taxes payable by P&amp;G
    since December 1, 1999.  When the question
    of the proper interpretation of returnable container arises in P&amp;Gs
    assessment appeals, the application judges binding interpretation of that term
    under the former definition will be of no consequence.  That is because the amended definition, with
    its retroactive application, now applies in the assessment appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge arrived at the correct result in
    concluding that the declaration does not entitle P&amp;G to have the former
    definition applied to the determination of its assessment appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal and fix the Ministers costs
    in the amount of $10,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. as agreed by
    counsel. </p>
