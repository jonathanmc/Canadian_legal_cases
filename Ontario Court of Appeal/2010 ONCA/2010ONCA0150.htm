    McNamara of the Superior Court of Justice striking the appellant’s pleadings in
    this family law dispute.  There is also an
    appeal from the judgment, which followed after a trial in the absence of the
    appellant.  A short history of the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent wife moved before the motions
    judge to strike the appellant’s pleadings on September 8, 2008.  The basis of the motion was the appellant
    husband’s alleged failure to answer 32 undertakings given on his examination
    for discovery, held some three months earlier on June 11, 2008.</p>

    wrote to counsel for the respondent as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We have been working on the undertakings.  I believe we can have all undertakings
    completed by October 17, 2008.  I am
    prepared to consent to the following order:</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Please <span class=GramE>advise</span>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This proposal was not accepted and the motion
    proceeded on September 29, 2008.  On that
    date, the motion judge made the following order:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Production of  outstanding undertakings to be provided as they become available but are
    to be completed no later than Thursday, October 9 failing which it is ordered
    that the respondent’s pleadings are to be struck; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Between October 1, 2008 and October 9, 2008,
    counsel for the appellant wrote seven letters to counsel for the respondent in
    which he purported to answer all 32 undertakings, which included the production
    of a number of documents.  The last letter
    on October 9, 2008, read:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am forwarding a fax of our final reply to the
    balance of the undertakings and I will forward two copies to your office first
    thing in the morning.  I am following up
    on your request for additional working documents from Collins Barrow.  Please advise if you require any additional
    documents and/or information.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent was of the view that
    the appellant had failed to answer the undertakings and on October 10, 2008,
    wrote to counsel for the appellant as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Please find attached a Draft Order striking the
    Respondent’s pleadings as well as Consent Form.  Please sign the Consent form and approve the draft Order as to form and
    content.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the same date, counsel for the appellant
    replied to the above letter as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I believe we have fully complied with the spirit of
    the Order to comply with undertakings.  Each undertaking has a response.  If there are additional documents required as per your first letter of
    the same date we will continue to search for and provide them.  I believe you do have sufficient material for
    your expert to work from.  I am not in a
    position to consent to your order and I believe the Motion judge indicated you
    do not need my consent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 14, 2008, counsel for the respondent
    wrote to the motions judge.  The letter read
    in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A copy of Your Honour’s endorsement from the
    September 29, 2008 motion is attached.  Mr. Stuyt failed to provide answers to all undertakings on or before the
    September [<i>sic</i>] 9, 2008 deadline.  I have attached a copy of my letter to Mr.
    Good, dated October 10, 2008, setting out the unanswered undertakings.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We now wish to take out an Order striking the
    Respondent’s pleadings/Answer, which will prevent the Respondent from having
    notice of any further steps in this court action.  Please note that during the September 29, 2008
    motion, you advised we did not need the Respondent’s consent to take out the
    Order in the event he failed to comply with the answers to undertakings.  We therefore attach for your signature three
    (3) Final Orders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No reference was made in the above letter to the
    letters of counsel for the appellant purporting to answer the undertakings.  The respondent’s counsel’s letter indicated
    that 7 of the 32 undertakings were not answered.  Details of the alleged deficiencies were
    provided.  However, the judge was not
    advised that the position of the appellant was that all undertakings were fully
    answered.  No affidavit or other sworn
    evidence was provided to the motions judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The order striking the pleadings followed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial of this matter proceeded before
    Parfett J. on December 8, 2009 in the absence of the appellant. Substantial
    relief was granted to the respondent including $1,511 per month in child
    support, extraordinary expenses of $189.30 per month, $8,900 in arrears of
    child support, an equalization payment of $387,486.99 and pre-judgment interest
    of $58,341.20.  The trial judge also
    granted a divorce decree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The final judgment is also under <span
class=GramE>appeal,</span> however, both parties agree that if we allow the
    appeal in respect of the order striking the pleadings, then the trial judgment
    should be set aside.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We return to the order of October 23, 2008
    striking the pleading.  We begin by noting
    that counsel for the respondent has withdrawn his position that the order is
    interlocutory.  He concedes that it is a
    final order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the order cannot stand for two reasons.  First, the request for the order striking the
    pleadings was made without any sworn evidence by way of affidavit before the
    motions judge.  All the motions judge had
    was the letter of October 14, 2009 from counsel for the respondent with the
    attached letter to counsel for the appellant.  Further, the motions judge was not advised of the correspondence from
    counsel for the appellant purporting to answer the undertakings.  Had the motion judge been provided with the
    appropriate information in proper evidentiary form, it is most unlikely that he
    would have struck the pleadings. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second reason for setting aside the order
    relates to the well-settled juris-prudence of this and other courts that an
    order striking pleadings is an order of last resort.  In our view, given the circumstances that the
    discoveries had been held barely three months earlier and the appellant
    counsel’s considerable efforts to answer the under-takings, this is clearly not
    a case for such an order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While undoubtedly the appellant’s counsel could
    have shown more initiative in protecting his client’s position, the obligation
    was on counsel for the respondent, when seeking an <i>ex parte</i> order, to make full, fair and frank disclosure of the
    relevant facts for the motions judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, the order striking the pleadings
    of the appellant is set aside.  As
    indicated above, the trial judgment is also set aside with the exception of the
    decree granting the divorce, which proceeded on an undefended basis throughout.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant shall have its costs of both appeals
    on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $12,000 inclusive of disbursements and
    GST. </p>
