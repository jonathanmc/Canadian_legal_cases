  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff in this lawsuit is a commercial landlord.  The defendants
    are Paris Boutique &amp; Bridal Inc., a commercial tenant, Tina Globocki, its
    owner, and her mother, Danica Globocki.  The third party, Susan Ambrose, acted
    as the plaintiff’s lawyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants’ pleadings disclose the following.  On November 14, 2008,
    she sent a demand letter to Paris Boutique, indicating that the tenant would be
    locked out on November 28, 2008, unless the arrears of rent were settled.  That
    did not happen, and at midnight on that day, the landlord changed the locks,
    denying the tenant access.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day, Ms. Globocki and her mother sought a meeting with Ms.
    Ambrose at which minutes of settlement and a promissory note were signed,
    enabling the tenant to go back into possession.  The defendants were also
    required to sign the promissory note guaranteeing the payment of Ms. Ambrose’s
    fees, and naming her as the payee.  That note was later assigned to the
    plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff subsequently commenced this action to enforce the minutes
    of settlement.  The defendants defended and counterclaimed against the landlord,
    seeking to set aside the minutes of settlement and the promissory note,
    together with general damages, aggravated damages and punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants also commenced a third party claim against Ms. Ambrose to
    set aside the promissory note and to recover general damages, aggravated
    damages, and punitive damages for the duress that they allege Ms. Ambrose
    applied, to force them to sign the minutes of settlement and promissory note in
    order to be allowed to re-enter the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Ambrose successfully moved under Rule 21 to strike the third party
    claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.  The defendants appeal from
    this decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that economic duress can serve to make an agreement
    unenforceable against a party who was compelled by the duress to enter into
    it.  Nor is there any doubt that the party can have the agreement declared void
    on this basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, not all pressure, economic or otherwise, can constitute duress
    sufficient to carry these legal consequences.  It must have two elements: it
    must be pressure that the law regards as illegitimate; and it must be applied
    to such a degree as to amount to “a coercion of the will” of the party relying
    on the concept.  See: <i>Stott v. Merit Investment  Corp.</i>, 63 O.R. (2nd)
    545 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 89.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third party claim here is asserted against the plaintiff’s lawyer
    acting as lawyer.  The only conduct of the lawyer that is pleaded to constitute
    the necessary economic pressure is that she would not provide re-entry to the
    defendants unless they agreed to sign the minutes of settlement and the
    promissory note.  No other pressuring conduct by the lawyer is pleaded or even
    suggested.  Nor is there any suggestion that in acting as pleaded, the lawyer
    was doing anything other than advancing her client’s position. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is plain and obvious that, without more, the defendants cannot
    succeed in elevating such routine conduct by a lawyer to a level that the law
    regards as illegitimate.  On this basis alone, the third party claim was
    properly struck.  Given that no suggestion is offered about what could be added
    to the claim to save it, leave to amend is denied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is thus unnecessary to explore whether the consequences of a proper
    claim for economic duress can extend beyond the setting aside of an agreement
    made as a consequence, or allowing the recovery of money having received, the
    only consequences described in the leading case of <i>Universe Tank Ships Inc.
    of Monrovia v. International Transport Workers’ Federation</i>, [1982] 2 All
    E.R. 67 (H.L.).  We simply note that no case was brought to our attention
    suggesting that economic duress can go further to yield general damages,
    aggravated damages, or punitive damages, as are claimed here, save for one in
    the majority of Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which was reversed on further
    appeal albeit on different part.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ final argument is that in any event, they are entitled
    to contribution from the third party because of her “fault” under the <i>Negligence
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N-1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The simple answer to this is that the only “fault” alleged in the third
    party claim is economic duress by the third party.  Since we have concluded
    that this claim is fatally flawed, no allegation of fault against the third
    party remains.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondent fixed at $6,500 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
