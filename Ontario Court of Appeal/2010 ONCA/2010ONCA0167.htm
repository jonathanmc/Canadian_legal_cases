  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 52 of the now repealed <i>Condominium Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. C26 requires a declarant (a
    condominium developer) to provide prospective purchasers with a disclosure statement
    which includes a budget for the condominium’s first year of operation.  Where the statement contains false, deceptive
    or misleading material information or omits material information, s. 52(5)
    provides both unit owners and the condominium corporation with a remedy for any
    damages or loss sustained as a result of reliance on the misstatement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to set aside the trial judgment
    wherein the appellant/declarant, Glengarda Residences Ltd., was held liable to
    the respondent condominium corporations for the failure to disclose sufficient
    information to condominium buyers regarding a lease of the heating, ventilation
    and air-conditioning system (HVAC) serving the shared rotunda in which the
    recreation facilities are located.  The
    trial judge held that “[a] reasonable purchaser who read the disclosure
    document carefully would not know that the HVAC system in the rotunda was not
    part of the purchase price and that he was assuming seven years of a lease with
    a balloon payment in addition to the one-year of the lease referred to in the
    budget” (para. 15).</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant <span class=SpellE>Glengarda</span> was
    the developer of the respondent condominium corporations.  The condominiums were developed in two
    phases: Condominium No. 89 was developed as Phase 1; and Condominium No. 101
    was developed at a later date as Phase 2.  The condominium buildings are each 12 storeys in height.  They are connected by a rotunda that houses
    facilities the use of which is shared by the unit owners of both condominiums.  The shared facilities area is equipped with
    its own HVAC system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the appellant intended from
    the outset to acquire the HVAC equipment and, prior to turning the buildings
    over to the condominium corporations, sell it to a financial institution that
    would lease the equipment back to the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As required by the <i>Act</i>,
    prior to marketing the condominium units in Phase 1 of the development
    (Condominium No. 89), the appellant prepared a disclosure statement which was
    provided to prospective purchasers.  This
    disclosure statement is dated November 18, 1998 and included in a package of
    documents entitled “The Gates of Glengarda Riverview Phase One Condominium
    Documents” which also included budgets for Phase 1 of the project and the
    shared facilities, dated November 1, 1998 and October 1, 1998
    respectively.  These documents were thus
    prepared before sales began in 1999.  I
    note that most of the units were marketed and sold prior to the actual
    construction of the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2001, approximately three months after the
    declaration creating Condominium Corporation No. 89 was registered and the
    first condominium building turned over to it, the appellant sold the HVAC
    equipment to the Royal Bank for the sum of $151,529.  The Royal Bank then leased the equipment back
    to the condominium corporation on an 8-year lease at a rate of approximately
    $2,600 per month with a purchase option price of $32,400 at the end of the
    lease.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The disclosure statement identified the fact that the
    cost of operating the shared facilities was to be divided between the two
    condominiums and was part of the condominiums’ common expenses charged to
    individual unit owners.  The projected
    first year’s budget for the shared facilities prepared by the appellant and contained
    in the disclosure statement included the following entry: “HVAC lease
    $34,900”.  This entry was under the
    heading “Repairs and Maintenance”.  A note
    to the budget explained that the HVAC lease was for “cost of the lease for air
    make-up and other air handling equipment in this area.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the disclosure statement was prepared in 1998, the
    HVAC equipment had not yet been acquired as construction of the building had
    not yet commenced.  The lease could not
    be negotiated until the equipment was acquired, sold to the bank and leased
    back to the condominium.  As noted, this
    did not occur until May 2001.  As a
    result, none of the terms of the proposed lease were known when the disclosure
    documents were drafted and the first units sold.  The appellant did, however, include an estimate
    of the projected annual cost of the lease in the projected first year budget.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents only learned of the sale and lease back
    transaction approximately six years later as a result of a building audit.  Only then did the respondents discover that
    they were bound by an 8-year lease of the HVAC equipment and that, at the end
    of the lease, they would have to make what the trial judge referred to as a $32,400
    “balloon payment”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents therefore brought a lawsuit claiming
    that the disclosure statement provided by the appellant lacked necessary
    information. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the appellant’s failure to
    include any narrative in the disclosure statement about the lease of the shared
    facilities’ HVAC equipment was misleading and therefore violated s. 52(5) of
    the <i>Act</i>.  As a result, he awarded damages equal to the
    full amount of the HVAC lease, less the costs for the first year of the lease
    which he found had been “clearly set out in the shared facilities budget and
    were partially paid by the [appellant]”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    the appeal first came before the court for hearing, the appellant advised that
    it was taking the position that this court’s earlier decision in <i>Wellington Corp. No. 61 v. Marilyn Drive
    Holdings Ltd.</i>, [1998] 37 O.R. (3<sup>rd</sup>) 1 (<i>Wellington</i>) had been wrongly decided by this court and should be
    overruled.  As a result, the appeal was
    adjourned and made returnable before a five-judge panel.  If the appellant is successful on this
    ground, it submits that it is clear that the appeal must be allowed.</span></p>

    following three grounds of appeal:</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons that follow, I would reject the appellant’s submission with respect
    to the correctness of the <i>Wellington</i> decision but would allow the appeal on the basis of the appellant’s alternate
    submissions.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span
lang=EN-US>Was Wellington correctly decided?</span></i><i></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant argued that this court’s decision in <i>Wellington</i> was wrongly decided and should be overruled.  It submits that <i>Wellington</i> is incorrect because it provides that a condominium
    corporation can recover damages for breach of s. 52(5) of the <i>Act </i>without complying with the
    requirement in s. 52(5) of showing that the unit purchasers suffered losses <i>in reliance </i>on a material misstatement
    or omission of information in a disclosure statement required to be delivered
    by a declarant to unit owners.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would reject this submission. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    need to address the reliance requirement in s. 52(5) differently in an action
    by a condominium corporation as compared to an action by a unit owner was fully
    explored in <i>Wellington</i>.  At pp. 19 and 20 of that decision, Rosenberg
    J.A. explained that s. 14(2) of the <i>Act</i> created a cause of action for the condominium corporation “even if the
    corporation was not a party to the contract in respect of which the action is
    brought.”  As he explained, read in the
    context of the legislation, it was manifest that the legislator intended “that
    the corporation be entitled to recover damages where the real injury is to the
    owners as a group rather than to any individual.”  He went on to explain that “in s. 52(5), the
    legislature has given the corporation the power to recover damages for false
    statements that were not made to it and upon which it therefore could not have
    relied.”  He then concluded that he could
    not “accept that the legislature nevertheless intended that the corporation
    prove it actually relied upon those statements.”  As a result, he concluded that “actual
    reliance need only be proved where the unit owner brings an action for damages.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    see no basis to disagree with these observations.  They reflect a reasoned and contextual
    interpretation of the relevant sections of the <i>Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    I do not, as the appellant suggests, view the test established in <i>Wellington</i> as ignoring the legislature’s
    intention to restrict damages awarded for breach of s. 52(5) of the <i>Act</i> to losses suffered <i>in reliance</i> on a material misstatement
    or omission of information from the disclosure statement.  <i>Wellington</i> simply struck a different approach to the requirement that the condominium
    corporation establish reliance, an approach that takes into account the fact
    that the statute creates a right of action even though the condominium
    corporation was not a party to the contract in respect of which the disclosure
    statement was made and the action brought. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    set out by Rosenberg J.A., the condominium corporation nonetheless needs to
    establish reliance.  It does so, however,
    by demonstrating that “it cannot reasonably carry out its duty to control,
    manage and administer the common elements and the assets of the corporation and
    to manage the property without incurring the expense occasioned by the false,
    deceptive or misleading statement or information or the expense that should
    have been disclosed in the disclosure statement.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, therefore, there is no need to revisit the <i>Wellington</i> decision.</span></p>
  <h3><i><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in finding that the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    52(1) of the <i>Act</i> requires that the
    declarant provide a disclosure statement to each purchaser of condominium
    units.  Section 52(6) sets out a list of
    what must be contained in the disclosure statement.  Included in this list is a budget statement
    for the condominium’s first year of operation immediately following the
    registration of the declaration (s. 52(6<span class=GramE>)(</span>e)).  The consequences of failing to fully disclose
    all of the information required by the <i>Act</i> are set out in s. 52(5), which provides as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Where statement false or misleading</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) Where any statement or material required under
    this Act to be provided by a declarant or proposed declarant to a purchaser of
    a unit or proposed unit for residential purposes contains any material
    statement or information that is false, deceptive or misleading or fails to
    contain any material statement or information, the corporation or any unit
    owner who relied on such statement or material is entitled, as against the
    declarant or the proposed declarant to damages for any loss sustained as a
    result of such reliance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To succeed in a claim pursuant to s. 52(6) the claimant
    must demonstrate both that there has been a material misstatement or that a
    material statement was omitted and that it has relied on this misstatement or
    omission.  I will deal with each of these
    two elements in turn.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that there had been material
    non-disclosure based on his finding that the disclosure statement did not “disclose
    the term of the lease, the total cost of the leased equipment, the rate of
    interest, the balloon payment, what equipment is subject to the lease, or <i>that there was a capital item that was not
    included in the purchase price</i>” (para. 13, emphasis added).  Later in his reasons, he reiterated that “a
    reasonable purchaser who read the disclosure document carefully <i>would not know that the HVAC system in the
    rotunda was not part of the purchase price</i> and that he was assuming seven
    years of a lease with a balloon payment in addition to the one year of the
    lease referred to in the budget” (para. 15, emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge correctly observed that the
    terms of the lease, other than the first year’s payment, had not been
    disclosed, his finding that a purchaser would not know that the HVAC system was
    not owned by the condominium corporation cannot, in my view, stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The disclosure document clearly stated that the HVAC
    equipment was leased.  <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> defines a lease
    as, “a contract by which the rightful possessor of personal property conveys
    the right to use that property in exchange for consideration” (<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 8<sup>th</sup> ed., <i>s.v.</i> “lease”).  Having read that the equipment was leased,
    the only reasonable conclusion a purchaser could reach is that this equipment
    was not owned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question then becomes, having disclosed that the
    equipment is leased as well as estimating the cost of the lease in the first
    year, is the disclosure adequate to meet the rigorous disclosure standards
    intended by the <i>Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 52 of the <i>Act</i> the declarant is required to provide current disclosure
    statements and all material amendments thereto.  The specific obligations are broadly worded and mandatory.  They are intended to protect the consumer and
    should be interpreted as such.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant prepared the disclosure statement, it
    could not set out the terms of the HVAC lease because, at that time, the
    equipment had not been <span class=GramE>acquired,</span> or installed and the
    lease had not been negotiated or entered into.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as noted by the trial judge, the appellant
    could have estimated the cost of the equipment, the term and rate of interest of
    the lease, and the amount of the payment required at the end of the lease to
    purchase the equipment.  Although I agree
    that such estimates may well have been useful information, the issue is not
    whether the estimate would have been useful.  Rather, the issue is whether the information
    is of sufficient importance that the appellant’s failure to disclose it makes
    the information contained in the disclosure statement “false, deceptive or
    misleading” or incomplete in a “material respect.”  In my view, it does not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 52(6<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(e) requires
    that the first year budget of the condominium corporation be included in the disclosure
    statement.  It was.  Within that budget statement, the cost of the
    lease was accurately disclosed, although it probably should not have been
    listed under the heading “repairs and maintenance”.  No other provision of s. 52(6) specifically
    requires disclosure of the details of an equipment lease of this type.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent argues that the requirement to include a description of the lease in
    the declaration flows from s. 52(6<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(b) of the <i>Act</i>.  This subsection provides that the disclosure statement must include a
    general description of the property including the types and number of building
    units and “recreational and other amenities” together with any “conditions that
    apply” to the provision of amenities.  This, the respondents submit, means that a description of the terms of
    the lease of the HVAC in the shared facilities must be included.  I do not agree.  The definition of “amenity” is “a useful or
    desirable feature of a place” (<i>Concise Oxford
    English Dictionary</i>, 10<sup>th</sup> ed., <i>s.v.</i> “amenity”).  When the
    section refers to “recreational and other amenities”, it is referring to
    amenities such as a party room, concierge, indoor swimming pool, and sauna, as
    set out in the declaration provided in the present case.  The HVAC system is not analogous to these features.  Read in context, the term amenties cannot
    reasonably be interpreted to include an HVAC system.  In any event, even if it were an “amenity,”
    “conditions that apply” to its provision, the lease, was disclosed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent then submits that a more detailed narrative of the lease would come
    within the required disclosure pursuant to s. 52(6<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(a).  The first part of that provision requires
    that a “brief narrative description of the significant features of the existing
    or proposed declaration, by-laws and rules governing the use of common elements
    and units” is to be included in the disclosure statement.  I would not give effect to this submission.  The second part of s. 52(6<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(a)
    specifically addresses leases.  The only
    leases addressed by the section are leases that “may be subject to termination
    or expiration under s. 39”.  Section 39
    deals with management agreements, agreements for the provision of recreational
    facilities and leases of premises.  The
    respondent concedes that the HVAC lease is not one to which s. 39 applies.  When read in the context of the section as a
    whole, it is apparent, therefore, that the requirement for a brief narrative
    description relates to agreements regulating matters of governance, management
    and the provision and use of the various spaces within the project.  The HVAC lease is not such a matter.  Further, the fact that the HVAC lease is not
    one of the leases specifically addressed by the section serves to confirm that
    an equipment lease of this nature was not the kind of “feature” contemplated by
    the drafters.  In my view, therefore, the
    section cannot be read so broadly as to require that the details of the lease of
    some of the mechanical equipment situated in the shared facilities be
    described.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, I consider that the information
    required to be disclosed by the <i>Act</i> is the existence and annual cost of the lease.  The failure to include other details of the lease in the disclosure
    statement is not, in my view, of such significance as to constitute a material
    misstatement or omission as contemplated by s. 52(5).  There was no evidence led at trial that the
    lease terms are anything other than commercially reasonable terms of a kind one
    would usually expect to find in an equipment lease.  Nor was there any evidence or suggestion that
    leasing equipment in this way is outside of normal business arrangements in
    buildings of this nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, the purchasers in this case were aware
    that the equipment would be leased and not owned and were aware of the estimated
    payments during the first year of the lease.  None of the details concerning this lease, such as the term or the fact
    of a $32,400 purchase option price make this information misleading nor are these
    details information required or expected when making a decision to purchase.  It may well be a different situation if, for
    example, the cost for the first year disclosed in the budget was significantly
    different from the ongoing annual cost.  Here, the natural inference from the first year budget was that the cost
    of the lease would be repeated annually.  That was accurate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the $32,400 due at the end of the lease
    referred to by the trial judge as a “balloon payment”, this payment is simply
    the optional purchase price to acquire the equipment at the term of the lease
    if the respondents chose to do so.  Again, nothing in the record suggests that the fact or amount of the
    optional purchase price is out of the ordinary or unexpected in a lease of this
    type.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, therefore, the failure to provide the
    details of the lease was not a material omission in breach of s. 52(5) of the <i>Act</i>. </p>
  <h3><span>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the respondents suffer loss in reliance on these

    set out in <i>Wellington</i>, a condominium
    corporation bringing a claim for damages for breach of s. 52(5) must show
    reliance by demonstrating that “it cannot reasonably carry out its duty to
    control, manage and administer the common elements and the assets of the
    corporation and to manage the property without incurring the expense occasioned
    by the false, deceptive or misleading statement or information or the expense
    that should have been disclosed in the disclosure statement” (<i>Wellington </i>at pp.20)  </span></p>

    disclosure of the first year’s operating budget of the condominium corporation
    was of particular significance.  It was
    clear to the Court “that the legislature has manifested an intention that
    purchasers know with a relatively high degree of certainty the expenses they
    are likely to incur within the first year<span class=GramE>”  (</span><i>Wellington </i>at pp. 20).  In that case, although the
    disclosure statement represented that the condominium corporation would have a
    live in superintendent, the first year’s budget for the condominium corporation
    did not include the expense that the condominium corporation would have to
    incur to provide accommodation for this live in superintendent.  The Court concluded, therefore, that the
    condominium corporation could not fulfill its obligations without incurring
    this undisclosed expense.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the present case, the first year’s budget was accurate.  Nothing suggested that the condominium
    corporation could not fulfill its obligations without incurring expenses in
    excess of the amounts set out in the budget.  The budgeted amount for the lease cost remained constant in each
    subsequent year and the condominium operated in this way, charging and
    recovering the annual lease payments without objection for some 6 years.  It was only as a result of a building audit
    that the matter was raised.  On the facts
    of this case, the inability of the respondents to demonstrate the required
    reliance, in a sense, flows from and confirms the fact that the disclosure
    statement did not contain a material misstatement or omission.</span></p>

    52(5) of the <i>Act</i>, a condominium
    corporation cannot bring a claim for misstatement in a disclosure
    statement.  As set out in <i>Wellington</i>, there is no contractual
    relationship between the condominium corporation and the developer, and
    reliance on the disclosure statement cannot be shown as the disclosure is made
    to unit owners and not the corporation.  I would not, therefore, give effect to this submission.</span></p>
