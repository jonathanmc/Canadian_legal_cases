  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Moldaver J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Hubert MacKinnon, brings this appeal in
    his dual capacity as the sole beneficiary and as executor and trustee of the estate
    of his late mother, Fanny MacKinnon. He appeals from two orders of the Superior
    Court of Justice.  The first order under
    appeal, dated April 21, 2009, dismissed Hubert’s application for a declaration
    that he, or alternatively his late mother’s estate, is the owner by
    prescription of a cottage property located in the District Municipality of Muskoka
    (the possessory title claim).  The second
    order under appeal, dated July 6, 2009, awarded Hubert $1,000 and further
    awarded $17,000 to the estate of his late father, Duke MacKinnon, for
    improvements he and Duke made to the property with their own funds, for which
    neither was compensated (the unjust enrichment claim).  In respect of the unjust enrichment claim,
    Hubert submits that the total award of $18,000 was too low and that it should
    be increased to $64,758.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, Charles Douglas Barry MacKinnon and
    Robert Warren MacKinnon, cross-appeal from the unjust enrichment award. They
    challenge Hubert’s contention that the award of $18,000 was too low, submitting
    instead that no award should have been made, or alternatively, that the award
    should be reduced to $5,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, on the main issue – whether
    Hubert’s possessory title claim should have succeeded – I would dismiss the
    appeal, albeit for reasons that differ from those given by the application
    judge. On the secondary issue – whether damages for unjust enrichment should
    have been ordered and if so whether the amount awarded was too low or too high
    – I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal, essentially for the reasons
    given by the application judge.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         Possessory
    Title Claim</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim for possessory title proceeded on a paper
    record consisting of documentary evidence, affidavit evidence from Hubert
    MacKinnon and Charles MacKinnon and cross-examinations on those affidavits. Co-respondent
    Robert Warren MacKinnon (Warren) filed a brief affidavit attesting to the
    accuracy of Charles’ affidavit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is not uncommon in cases of this nature, the protagonists
    are one generation removed from the parties who had first-hand knowledge of the
    pertinent events – in this case, the parents and two paternal aunts of Hubert,
    Charles and Warren – who have since passed on. The missing primary evidence can
    make it very difficult for a court to determine the nature of the relationship
    that existed between the original parties and in particular, the basis upon
    which the original occupiers, through whom the claim for possessory title is
    made, occupied the property in question. For reasons that will become apparent,
    I view that as the central issue in this case – and its resolution turns on the
    intention of those who are no longer with us and who created no formal
    documentation that might assist. As such, the answer must be found in the
    conduct of the original parties and any special circumstances that might shed
    light on their intentions. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (i)        The Salient Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Muskoka property in question comprises
    approximately two acres and forms part of a larger farm that has been in the
    MacKinnon family for more than a century.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1958, Mercy and Flora MacKinnon became the owners of
    the farm property through an inheritance. Mercy and Flora had a number of
    siblings including Duke MacKinnon. Duke was married to Fanny and they had a
    number of children, including the appellant, Hubert, and the respondents,
    Charles and Warren.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duke and his family initially lived in the Brantford
    area. Duke was a carpenter by trade while Fanny looked after the household. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the mid-1950s, Duke suffered a serious injury that
    left him incapable of working full time as a carpenter. From then on, he worked
    mostly for himself and apart from the odd outside <span class=GramE>job,</span> he had very little earning potential. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duke’s sisters, Mercy and Flora, remained single throughout
    their lives and had no children. Both maintained gainful employment at separate
    locations in Ontario. In the late 1950s or early 1960s, they decided to retire
    from work and live on the Muskoka farm property, which they now owned. They had
    the financial means to build a home on the farm but they needed someone to
    build it. That is where Duke came in. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, by the time Mercy and Flora were ready to
    retire to the farm, Duke was unable to make ends meet. With that in mind, Flora
    and Mercy proposed that Duke build two homes on the farm property, one for them
    and one for him and Fanny. Flora and Mercy would pay for the materials and Duke
    would do the construction. And when the homes were finished, Duke and Fanny
    would live in one and Flora and Mercy would live in the other. Duke would pay
    no rent or taxes. His job would be to maintain the properties and drive Flora
    and Mercy to town as required, since neither one could drive. In return, Flora
    and Mercy would provide Duke with a small monthly stipend (his only source of
    income pending receipt of his Old Age Pension). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That arrangement, it seems, met with everyone’s
    approval. Construction of the first home began in the early 1960s and by all
    accounts, both homes were completed by 1966. While there is some dispute about
    when Duke and Fanny took up permanent residence in Muskoka, everyone agrees
    that this occurred by 1972 at the latest, when Duke and Fanny sold their
    Brantford-area home. The exact date is immaterial. What is material is that
    Duke and Fanny lived in the second home from at least 1972 to 1983, when Duke
    died. During that timeframe, in accordance with the oral arrangement between
    him and his sisters, Duke maintained both properties and drove his sisters to
    town. In return, he received a small monthly stipend. He paid no taxes on the
    property and no rent to his sisters for its use.  Although it was not part of the arrangement,
    Duke constructed a sunroom and some outbuildings on the property in 1972 with
    funds realized from the sale of his Brantford-area home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At Duke’s funeral in 1983, Mercy spoke to Charles and
    told him that she and Flora wanted the farm to go to him and Warren. It was
    their wish that the farm remain in the family and they felt that Charles and
    Warren were financially stable and would not look to sell it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1986, Flora and Mercy formalized their plan. They
    conveyed the farm to Charles and Warren for $2 and natural love and affection,
    on the understanding that they (Flora and Mercy) would retain a life interest
    in it. They also had Charles and Warren promise that their mother Fanny could remain
    in the second home until she died.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Charles, Fanny was initially pleased to
    learn that he and Warren were now the owners of the Muskoka farm property. In
    the years that followed, however, Fanny apparently asked Charles and Warren on
    more than one occasion to convey ownership of the second home to her. Charles
    and Warren refused to do so, in part because they were concerned that she was
    being influenced by Hubert who, by 1986, had moved in with her on a more or
    less permanent basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Charles and Warren, Hubert was <span
class=GramE>a</span> “n’er do well” who used drugs, had a criminal past, and
    could not hold down a job. In their opinion, he had chosen to move in with
    Fanny for selfish reasons, including the fact that he could not afford to
    support himself. Hubert, on the other hand, maintained that his reason for
    moving in with Fanny was altruistic. Fanny was alone and he was willing to care
    for her and help with the upkeep of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever his motivation, Hubert lived with Fanny
    continuously until 2006 when Fanny, because of illness, moved west to be with
    her daughter. While Hubert lived with Fanny, he mowed the lawns and did minor
    chores and maintenance around the property. He also drove Fanny to town and
    elsewhere as required. Neither he nor Fanny paid rent or taxes and Hubert
    received no compensation from his aunts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After Fanny moved west, Hubert lived with one of his
    children in Brantford during the winters of 2006 and 2007.  He lived in Muskoka for the remainder of 2006
    and 2007. In the spring of 2006, Charles and Warren told Hubert that he was no longer
    welcome on the property and they asked him to leave by the end of June 2006.
    Hubert did not comply. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2008, Fanny died. In her last will and
    testament, she named Hubert as her executor and trustee and bequeathed all of
    her assets to him. Shortly thereafter, in May 2008, Warren demanded that Hubert
    leave the property. Hubert refused to comply, in part because he had several hand-written
    notes from his mother in which she expressed her “belief” that the home in
    which she was living and the property surrounding it belonged to her and she
    wanted Hubert to have it “for coming to live with me and take care of me”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Armed with those notes and fixed with the belief that
    either he or his mother’s estate had become the owner of the property, in May
    2008, Hubert applied to the Superior Court for a declaration to that effect. In
    the alternative, he sought compensation for the value by which he and his father
    Duke had improved the land.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       Decision of the Application Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application was argued on April 6, 2009. On April
    21, 2009, the application judge released written reasons in which he dismissed Hubert’s
    possessory title claim. On May 7, 2009, the application judge released a second
    set of reasons in which he allowed Hubert’s unjust enrichment claim for the
    sunroom and outbuildings Duke had built in 1972 and for some minor improvements
    that Hubert had made. On July 6, 2009, in a third set of reasons, the
    application judge awarded damages against Charles and Warren for unjust
    enrichment in the total amount of $18,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for dismissing Hubert’s possessory title
    claim, the application judge made the following findings of fact based on the
    documentary and evidentiary record before him:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The home on the disputed property was built by
    Duke with funds supplied by his sisters.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From 1963 to 1983, Duke maintained the entire
    property including the “parts occupied by his sisters”.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Duke provided transportation to his sisters.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Duke’s sisters paid him a stipend for his
    services.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After Duke’s death in 1983, while Fanny remained
    on the property, minimal maintenance was done. Hubert regularly mowed the lawns
    “for both the disputed property and the aunts’ property”.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither Duke nor Fanny ever paid taxes on the
    property. Duke paid some property insurance for a time but stopped when he
    learned that he had no insurable interest in the property. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The notes written by Fanny confirmed that “she
    knew she did not own the property but believed that she should”. Fanny
    requested a deed from Charles and Warren on more than one occasion but she was
    refused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having made those findings, the application judge
    reviewed the applicable legal principles, noting that Hubert’s claim for
    possessory title “is founded under s. 5 of the <i>Real Property Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15” (the Act) and
    that the “section requires ten years actual possession or in the case of a
    tenant at will under subsection (7) ten years plus one year from the
    commencement of the tenancy to establish possessory title.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge then outlined the test for
    possessory title identified by this court in <i>Masidon Investments Ltd. v. Ham</i> (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 563 at 567 and <i>Keefer v. Arillotta</i> (1976), 13 O.R. (2d)
    680 at 692, namely: that claimants seeking possessory title must establish that
    throughout the statutory period, they had actual possession of the disputed
    property, they intended to exclude the true owner from possession, and they effectively
    excluded the true owner from possession.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having outlined the three-pronged test, the application
    judge identified the issue that in his view was critical to Hubert’s claim, that
    is, whether Hubert had shown that the true owners were effectively excluded
    from the property throughout the statutory period. In this regard, the
    application judge referred again to <i>Masidon</i>,
    where at pp. 568&#8209;74, Blair&nbsp;J.A. considered the concept of “effective
    exclusion” under the third prong of the test, noting that it was not every use
    of land that would support a claim for possessory title; rather, the use must
    be inconsistent with the form and use of enjoyment the owner intended to make
    of it. This was especially so in the case of trespassers, against whom the test
    would be strictly applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast to claims made by trespassers, the
    application judge observed that courts had taken a somewhat more flexible
    approach to claims made by persons with “some colour of right” to the property,
    citing by way of example two cases in which the claims for possessory title of family
    members living on a family compound under a “loose family arrangement” had
    “received a sympathetic reception”.  See <i>Train v. Metzger</i> (1974), 5 O.R. (2d) 540
    (H.C.) and <i>Horne v. Grant</i>,<i> </i>2003 Can.LII 44731 (Ont.&nbsp;Sup.
    Ct.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying those principles to the case at hand, the
    application judge observed that there were two distinct periods within which
    “the limitations period could have run its course”: – the first, when Duke
    lived on the property from 1963 (or 1972 at the latest) until his death in
    1983; the second while Fanny lived on the property from “1983 – 2002” [sic
    2006] when she moved west to live with her daughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the second and third tests identified in <i>Masidon</i> – whether in the first time
    frame, Duke showed an intention to exclude his sisters from possession and
    whether he effectively did so – the application judge reviewed the
    circumstances under which Duke and Fanny moved to the property and, in
    particular, the arrangement between him and his sisters, noting that “he [Duke]
    honoured his side of the bargain and his sisters honoured theirs”. He then
    explained, at paras. 35-37, why in his view, Duke’s occupation of the property
    satisfied the second test for possessory title, but not the third:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The questions are therefore does his occupation of
    the property in these circumstances:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>show
    an intention to exclude the registered owners from the property and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
class=GramE>effectively</span> exclude those owners from the property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe the answer to the first question is yes.
    His position was that of a tenant at will. He built the house for himself and
    treated it as his property, improving it on one occasion and maintaining its
    lawn and garden separate from those of his sisters. Although there was no doubt
    visiting back and forth neither he nor his sisters ever doubted that he was the
    occupier of the property and they had no right to enter or make use of it at
    will.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The answer to the second question however is no.
    His sisters had a clearly defined use for the property. It was to provide a
    home for their brother to keep him at their beck and call. Not only was he
    there with their permission, they actually paid him to remain. It cannot be
    said that his presence on the land in any way interfered with the use they
    wished to make of it. His presence there was exactly the use they wished to
    make of that part of their property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the second timeframe, when Fanny occupied
    the property after Duke’s death from 1983 to 2006, the application judge noted
    that the circumstances of her occupation differed from those that existed when
    Duke was alive. Fanny had no “handyman skills” and “she could not drive”.
    Nonetheless, Flora and Mercy were content that she <span class=GramE>stay</span> on the property until her death and they made this known to Charles and Warren,
    who respected their wishes. Fanny knew that she did not own the property and
    Charles and Warren refused her request for a deed on more than one occasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having outlined the circumstances under which Fanny
    occupied the property, the application judge considered the two questions he
    had posed in relation to Duke and explained, at paras. 40-42, why in his view,
    Fanny’s occupation satisfied the second test for possessory title, but not the
    third:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the questions set out in paragraph 35 above, are
    applied to this scenario I would answer them as follows. The answer to the
    first question is again yes. Fanny clearly demonstrated an intention to exclude
    the registered owners of the property and all others from possession. The fact
    that the respondents visited the property to see their mother or effect
    repairs, in no way diminishes her position that she occupied the property and
    they were there on her permission.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>However the answer to the third
    question must again be no.</span> Once again the intended use of the land by
    the registered owners coincided with the use being made of it. Mercy and Flora
    wished their sister-in-law to remain on the land during her lifetime. The
    respondents also wished their mother to remain in the home both to honour their
    aunt’s wishes and to ensure she had a place to live.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No expression of disagreement by Fanny with the
    level of ownership she exercised could alter the fact that her presence in the
    house was the very use the registered owners wished to be made of the property.
    The third part of the test cannot be met in those circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, with respect to Hubert’s personal claim, the
    application judge rejected it on the basis that Hubert had not been in
    possession of the property for ten years “since his mother’s death” and
    therefore, he could not meet the first test for possessory title.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Did the Application Judge Apply the Correct Test?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hubert submits that the application judge applied the
    wrong test in rejecting the possessory title claim. In particular, he contends
    that the “inconsistent use” test, which the application judge applied in
    holding that Duke and Fanny’s use and occupation of the property did not
    effectively exclude the true owners from possession, is inapplicable where, as
    here, the claim to possessory title is based on a combination of sections 5(7)
    and 15 of the Act.  Those sections read
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5(7) Where a person is in possession or in receipt
    of the profits of any land, or in receipt of any rent, as tenant at will, the
    right of the person entitled subject thereto, or of the person through whom
    that person claims, to make an entry or distress, or to bring an action to
    recover the land or rent, shall be deemed to have first accrued either at the
    determination of the tenancy, or at the expiration of one year next after the
    commencement of the tenancy, at which time the tenancy shall be deemed to have
    determined.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15 At the determination of the period limited by
    this Act to any person for making an entry or distress or bringing any action,
    the right and title of such person to the land or rent, for the recovery
    whereof such entry, distress or action, respectively, might have been made or
    brought within such period, is extinguished.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hubert submits that his claim is to be distinguished
    from an adverse possession claim made by a trespasser, who relies on ss. 4 and
    15 of the Act to defend against the true owner’s right of recovery in order to extinguish
    his or her title. Section 4 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4  No person shall
    make an entry or distress, or bring an action to recover any land or rent, but
    within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or
    distress, or to bring such action, first accrued to some person through whom
    the person making or bringing it claims, or if the right did not accrue to any
    person through whom that person claims, then within ten years next after the
    time at which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such
    action, first accrued to the person making or bringing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, Hubert’s claim to possessory title rests on
    his contention that Duke and Fanny occupied the property as tenants at will
    throughout the statutory period. He submits that for purposes of s. 5(7) of the
    Act, that period began to run on the notional termination of the tenancy one
    year after it had commenced, notwithstanding the permissive character of the
    occupation. See <i>Ocean Harvesters Ltd. v.
    Quinlan Brothers Ltd.</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 684 at 686.  Hubert further submits that once it is
    accepted that Duke and Fanny occupied the property as tenants at will<span
class=GramE>,</span> the “inconsistent use” doctrine cannot be invoked to
    defeat a claim made through them for possessory title. To hold otherwise would
    render s. 5(7) meaningless. Manifestly, as tenants at will, Duke and Fanny’s
    use of the property would always be consistent with the use the true owner
    intended to make of it. Valuable as the “inconsistent use” doctrine might be in
    defeating adverse possession claims brought by trespassers who have used the
    property in a manner not inconsistent with the owner’s intended use of it, the
    doctrine could play no part in a claim for possessory title based on s.&nbsp;5(7)
    of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, Hubert’s position is correct, both for the
    reason he offers and for the more basic reason that a finding of tenancy necessarily
    entails a right of exclusive possession.  Dickson J. put the matter succinctly in <i>Ocean Harvesters</i> at pp. 686-87: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While exclusive possession may not always give rise
    to tenancy (<i>Errington v. Errington</i> [[1952] 1 All E.R. 149], <i>Cobb v. Lane</i> [[1952] 1 All E.R. 1199]), I think it beyond question that a tenancy cannot be
    created in the absence of exclusive possession. <i>Exclusive</i> possession by the tenant is essential to the demise and
    the statute [the <i>Limitation of Actions </i>(<i>Realty</i>) <i>Act </i>(of Newfoundland), R.S.N. 1952, c. 145 (the equivalent of the
    Ontario Act)] will not operate to bar the owner unless the owner is out of
    possession.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If there were nothing more to the case, I would allow
    the appeal and give Hubert the declaration he seeks. But there is more, and it
    stems from what Dickson J. said in <i>Ocean
    Harvesters </i>at pp. 686-67, namely: “exclusive possession may not always give
    rise to a tenancy”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my discussion so far, I have assumed that Duke and
    Fanny occupied the property as tenants at will throughout the requisite
    statutory period. The application judge found that to be the case. With
    respect, I believe he erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Access to s. 5(7) of the Act is restricted to claims involving
    persons who have occupied the property as tenants at will. Hence, to succeed in
    this case, Hubert bore the onus of establishing, on balance, that Duke and
    Fanny occupied the property as tenants at will. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the evidence does not support such a
    finding. On the contrary, it supports a finding that Duke and Fanny occupied the
    property as licensees. To the extent the application judge found otherwise, I
    am respectfully of the view that his finding is not entitled to the deference
    it would normally attract for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the application judge did not address the issue.
    The word “licensee” does not appear in his reasons and he provides no
    explanation for finding a tenancy relationship as opposed to a licensee
    relationship. In fairness, it would appear that the parties did not raise that
    issue with him. They were, however, asked to address it on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the application judge’s conclusion that Duke
    and Fanny occupied the property as tenants at will rests almost entirely on his
    finding that they enjoyed sole occupation of the property during the years they
    inhabited it.  While I do not quarrel
    with that finding, it does not, by itself, determine the status of their
    occupation. As will be seen, the critical question in that regard is not
    whether Duke and Fanny were allowed to enjoy sole occupation of the property in
    fact, but whether they were given a right of exclusive possession to it in law.
    See <i>Radaich v. Smith</i>, [1959] 101
    C.L.R. (High Court of Australia) per Windeyer J. at p. 223.</p>
  <h4><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>(iv)      Tenancy</span></span><span lang=EN-US> Relationship v. Licensee Relationship</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin my analysis with something the application
    judge did not mention, perhaps because he felt that nothing much turned on it. Be
    that as it may, I observe that in Hubert’s affidavit filed on the application, he
    states on two occasions that neither he nor his mother ever occupied the property
    as tenants. Paragraphs 22 and 35 of his affidavit read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>22.       No
    acknowledgment or statement or act was made, stated or done by either my mother
    or I to the effect that my mother and I were occupying the property as mere
    tenants or as persons occupying the property at the will of my aunts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>35.       No
    acknowledgement or statement or act has been made, stated or done by either my
    mother or I to the effect that my mother and I were occupying the property as
    mere tenants or as persons occupying the property at the will of my brothers.
    At all times we occupied the property and treated it as if we were the owners,
    planting gardens, maintaining the house and grounds and paying all the costs of
    operating the property except municipal taxes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If nothing more, the concessions that neither he nor
    his mother ever occupied the property as tenants at will are somewhat
    surprising given that Hubert’s case for possessory title rests on just such a
    finding – more accurately, that Duke and Fanny occupied the property in that
    capacity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hubert’s “slip” cannot, however, be taken as
    dispositive. Perhaps he was simply trying to say that at all times, he and his
    mother acted under the belief that they were the rightful owners of the
    property and no one advised them differently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, to succeed in his claim for
    possessory title, Hubert had to bring the case within s. 5(7) of the Act. It
    follows, with <span class=GramE>respect, that</span> the application judge
    erred in structuring his analysis on the <i>Masidon </i>model. He should instead have asked whether Duke and Fanny were tenants at
    will and, if so, whether their occupation of the property in that capacity was
    continuous and uninterrupted for a period of ten years following the notional
    termination of the tenancy one year after its commencement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, as I see it, this case turns on the first
    of those questions, namely, whether Duke and Fanny occupied the property as
    tenants at will. The answer to that question lies in the nature of the
    relationship that existed between Duke and his sisters, Mercy and Flora, under
    the original arrangement by which Duke occupied the property and thereafter,
    the nature of the relationship that existed between Fanny and her sons, Charles
    and Warren, under the arrangement by which Fanny occupied the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did Duke and Fanny occupy the property as tenants at
    will or as licensees?  The distinction
    between the two legal concepts is important in possessory title claims because
    a tenancy at will creates an estate or interest in the land, whereas a licence
    to use the land does not, although it may give rise to contractual rights (see <i>Street v. Mountford</i>, [1985] 2 All E.R.
    289 at 291 and <i>Errington</i> at p. 154).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For present purposes, s. 5(7) of the Act only comes
    into play if Duke and Fanny occupied the property as tenants at will. The right
    of recovery contemplated by that provision carries with it the notion that either
    the person or persons seeking recovery, or their predecessors, have conveyed an
    estate or interest in the land. If no such estate has passed, as is the case
    where the property is occupied pursuant to a licence, there is nothing to be
    reclaimed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What then is a tenant at will and what distinguishes a
    tenancy from a licensee?  In <i>Ocean Harvesters</i>, at p. 686 Dickson J.
    explained that “[A] tenancy at will is created when one person permits another
    to occupy lands on the agreement, express or implied, that the tenancy is
    determinable at the will of either”. He further observed at p. 687 that “<i>[E]xclusive</i> possession by the tenant is
    essential to the demise and the statute will not bar the owner unless the owner
    is out of possession”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the distinction between a tenant and licensee, at
    pp. 687-88 Dickson J. adopted as correct the following statement of law
    expressed by Windeyer J. in <i>Radiach</i> at p. 222:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What then is the fundamental right which a tenant
    has that distinguishes his position from that of a licensee? It is an interest
    in land as distinct from a personal permission to enter the land and use it for
    some stipulated purpose or purposes. And how is it to be ascertained whether
    such an interest in land has been given? By seeing whether the grantee was
    given <i>a legal right of exclusive
    possession</i> of the land for a term or from year to year or for a life or
    lives. If he was, he is a tenant. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With that in mind, one of the first questions that
    comes to mind is whether, under the original arrangement, Duke and his sisters
    intended to create a legally binding landlord and tenant relationship under
    which an estate in the property passed to Duke, along with the mutual rights
    and obligations that accompany it – including, at least theoretically, a right in
    Duke to sublet the property to a complete stranger.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent formal documentation, of which there is none, and
    absent first-hand evidence from the original parties, I have difficulty
    accepting that Duke and his sisters intended to enter into any legal
    relationship at all, much less one that gave rise to the special relationship
    of landlord and tenant. On the contrary, it seems far more likely that they intended
    a loose family arrangement of convenience under which Flora and Mercy conferred
    personal privileges upon Duke, without giving any interest in the land.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Flora and Mercy were looking to retire on the family
    farm which they had recently inherited. They needed someone to build a home for
    them and maintain the property.  And
    since neither one could drive, they needed someone with a car who could take
    them to town. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duke proved to be the perfect choice. Unable to work
    fulltime as a carpenter due to injury, he was short of money. Flora and Mercy
    could afford the building materials needed for their home and a second one for
    Duke and Fanny. Duke would provide the labour.  After the homes were built, Duke and Fanny would live rent free in the
    second one and Flora and Mercy would pay the taxes on both properties. They
    would also pay Duke a small monthly stipend to maintain the properties and
    drive them to town as required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the facts and circumstances of this case
    take it out of the mainstream and place it in a special category of cases under
    which the occupation of the property by Duke and Fanny, though exclusive, was
    that of a licensee, not a tenant at will.  Put simply, Duke was allowed to enjoy sole
    occupation of the property in fact, but he was not given a right of exclusive
    possession in law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The special category of cases of which I speak has been
    identified in a number of English authorities, including <i>Street v. Mountford</i>; <i>Heslop
    v. Burns</i>, [1974] 1 W.L.R. 1241 (C.A.); <i>Errington
    v. Errington</i>; <i>Cobb v. Lane</i> and <i>Facchini v. Bryson</i>, [1952] 1 T.L.R. 1386
    (C.A.), where at pp. 1389-90 Denning L.J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In all the cases where an occupier has been held to
    be a licensee there has been something in the circumstances, such as a family
    arrangement, an act of friendship or generosity, or such like, to negative any
    intention to create a tenancy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Errington v.
    Errington</i> at pp. 154-55, Denning L.J. referred to a number of cases in
    which “occupiers in exclusive possession” had “been held to be not tenants, but
    only licensees”.  He explained the
    rationale as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The result of all these cases is that, although a
    person who is let into exclusive possession is, <i>prima facie</i>, to be considered to be a tenant, nevertheless he will
    not be held to be so if the circumstances negative any intention to create a
    tenancy. Words alone may not suffice. Parties cannot turn a tenancy into a
    licence merely by calling it one. <i>But if
    the circumstances and the conduct of the parties show that all that was
    intended was that the occupier should be granted a personal privilege with no
    interest in the land, he will be held only to be a licensee</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Cobb v. Lane</i>,
    decided after <i>Errington</i>, is one such
    example. The case is useful for present purposes because it is factually similar
    to the case at hand and it traces the development and refinement of the law
    that has led to the modern-day distinction between tenancies and licensees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts in <i>Cobb</i> are straightforward. As a result of discussions at a family gathering, Agatha
    Lane purchased a house in her name. She permitted her brother and his wife and
    young daughter to live in it. Shortly after the brother and his family moved
    in, he became ill and could not afford to pay the taxes. He and his sister then
    agreed that he could remain in the house rent-free and she would pay the taxes;
    in return, he was to “keep the house intact.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the next 13 years, until his sister’s death in
    1950, the brother lived in the house in accordance with the arrangement. At her
    death, Agatha left the house to others and her executors claimed possession of
    it, contending that her brother was a mere licensee. The brother, on the other
    hand, claimed that because he had had exclusive possession of the house for an
    indefinite period of time, a tenancy at will should be implied so as to bar the
    action and extinguish Agatha’s title under statutory provisions similar to
    those found in ss. 5(7) and 15 of the Ontario Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On these facts, the trial judge rejected the defendant
    brother’s contention and concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think it is fair to infer that the defendant’s
    occupation of the premises in the present case was a consequence of the family
    discussion which took place at Christmas, 1935. <i>It was a method of providing financial assistance to the defendant and
    his wife and infant daughter by means of a convenient family arrangement. I do
    not think that there was any intention on the part of any of the parties
    concerned of creating any legal relationship or of assuming any legal
    obligations</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Court of Appeal, Somervell L.J. delivered the
    primary set of reasons. He found at p. 1201 that the trial judge had “applied
    the proper principles” to the facts and had come “to the same conclusion as I
    would myself have come to.”  In so
    holding, Somervell L.J. did not “very much quarrel” with the proposition, put
    forward on behalf of the brother, that “where there is exclusive occupation for
    an indefinite period a tenancy at will must be implied unless there is
    something in the facts to prevent that conclusion” (at p. 1200).  That said, he noted that “[t]he modern cases establish
    that, if there is evidence of the circumstances in which the person claiming to
    be a tenant at will went into occupation, those circumstances must be considered
    in deciding what the intention of the parties was (at p. 1200).” In this
    regard, Somervell&nbsp;L.J. quoted with approval the following observations of
    Lord Greene M.R. in <i>Booker v. Palmer</i>,<i> </i>[1942] 2 All E.R. 674 at 676-77:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether or not parties intend to create as between
    themselves the relationship of landlord and tenant, under which an estate is
    created in the tenant and certain mutual obligations arise by implication of
    law, must in the last resort be a question of intention... There is one golden
    rule which is of very general application, namely, that the law does not impute
    intention to enter into legal relationships where the circumstances and the
    conduct of the parties negative any intention of the kind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a concurring opinion, Denning L.J., after reviewing
    the facts, made the following apposite observations at p. 1202:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The question
    in all these cases is one of intention: Did the circumstances and the conduct
    of the parties show that all that was intended was that the occupier should
    have a personal privilege with no interest in the land? It seems to me that the </i>[<i>trial</i>]<i> judge has so found. The defendant had only a personal privilege with
    no interest in the land, which he could assign or sub-let, and he could not
    part with the possession to another</i>. He was only a licensee, and he cannot
    pray in aid the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1939. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Heslop v. Burns</i> is another case where the rightful owner of a cottage allowed a husband and his
    wife and daughter to live in the cottage rent free from 1954 until the owner’s
    death in 1970. In his will, the owner left the property to others. His estate
    sued for possession, contending that the family had acquired a personal licence
    to occupy the premises without payment of rent and that the licence terminated
    upon the owner’s death. The family resisted, maintaining that they had occupied
    the cottage as tenants at will for more than 12 years and that the deceased’s
    right of action had accordingly become statute-barred under the <i>Limitation Act, 1939</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the family’s submissions and
    refused to make an order for possession. He found that the deceased, who had
    formed a romantic relationship with the wife, had meant to provide a home for
    the family and intended that they continue to live there. At no time did the
    deceased require the family to pay rent or taxes or any other expenses relating
    to the property. Until he became ill in 1968, the deceased would visit the
    family regularly, sometimes twice a day, and often have dinner with them. As
    well, he became the child’s godfather and paid for her education and provided
    her with money and gifts. In those circumstances, the trial judge found that
    the family had occupied the cottage as tenants at will of the deceased and
    accordingly, he found in their favour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The English Court of Appeal unanimously overturned that
    finding, concluding instead that the family occupied the cottage as licensees.
    All three justices (Stamp, Roskill and Scarman L.J.J.) adopted the principles
    enunciated some 20 years earlier in <i>Cobb
    v. Lane</i> and concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that there was
    an intention to create an interest in land in the family. Roskill L.J. put the
    matter succinctly at p. 1249 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For my part, like Stamp L.J., I am quite unable to
    infer any intention in the present case to create legal relations at all, let
    alone an intention to create in the defendants [the family] any interest in the
    land in these premises... Indeed, with all respect to the county court judge,
    who reached the opposite conclusion, I think the whole weight of the evidence
    is the other way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In separate reasons, Scarman L.J. considered the
    modern-day approach by which courts are to analyze cases of this nature. On the
    facts before him, the new approach meant that even if the family had the right
    to exclude the deceased from the property under the terms of their occupation, that
    would not, in <span class=GramE>itself</span>, necessarily result in a tenancy
    at will. Citing <i>Cobb v. Lane</i>, Scarman
    L.J. observed at p. 1252 that exclusive occupation of property for an
    indefinite period of time is no longer inconsistent with the occupier being a
    licensee and not a tenant at will.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Returning to the modern-day approach, Scarman L.J. explained,
    at p. 1252, that what had “happened between 1899 and 1952” was not a function
    of impermissible “judicial legislation”, but a reflection of changes in
    society:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What has happened, of course, is not that the law
    has changed but that society has. To deal with changed social conditions, the Rent
    Restrictions Acts since 1914-1915 have introduced a new dimension to the law of
    landlord and tenant, and there has also emerged into prominence the licence to
    occupy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Scarman L.J., changes in society had led
    the courts to engage in a “more subtle investigation ... in answering the two
    questions: ‘What is the intention of the parties?’ and ‘Are there circumstances
    negativing the inference of a tenancy at will?’”  He quoted with approval Denning L.J.’s statement
    in <i>Facchini v. Bryson</i>, set out above
    at para. 56, which, according to Scarman L.J., provides “helpful guidance as to
    the sort of circumstances that now have to be examined and assessed in
    determining whether or not a tenancy has been created” (at p. 1252). For
    convenience, the pertinent quote from <i>Facchini</i> is reproduced again:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In all the cases where an occupier has been held to
    be a licensee there has been something in the circumstances, such as a family
    arrangement, an act of friendship or generosity, or such like, to negative any
    intention to create a tenancy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying those guidelines to the case before him,
    Scarman L.J. found the situation to be “akin to a family relationship”, “a
    whole course of dealing within the realm of friendship”, and “very great
    generosity shown over a long number of years” by the deceased to the family.  In the end, he could not see how the case
    before him could be distinguished in principle from <i>Cobb v. Lane</i>.  Scarman L.J. concluded
    at p. 1253 that the “social changes” to which he had alluded “seem to show that
    less and less will the courts be inclined to infer a tenancy at will from an
    exclusive occupation of indefinite duration.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have referred at some length to <i>Heslop v. Burns</i> and in particular Scarman L.J.’s reasons because,
    in my view, the approach taken in that case reflects the approach that courts
    should be taking when s. 5(7) of the Act is set up as a bar to a claim for
    possession brought by or on behalf of the owner. In this regard, I note that <i>Heslop</i> was referred to with apparent
    approval by the House of Lords in its 1985 decision in <i>Street v. Mountford</i> at p. 298.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Street v.
    Mountford</i>, at p. 298, Templeman L.J. writing for the court (of which Lord
    Scarman was now a member) made specific reference to Denning L.J.’s statement
    in <i>Facchini v. Bryson</i> that Scarman
    L.J. had approved in <i>Heslop v. Burns</i>.
     Templeman&nbsp;L.J. also referred, at p.
    300, to the <i>Radaich </i>decision from
    Australia and, like Dickson J. in <i>Ocean
    Harvesters</i>, he too adopted as correct Windeyer&nbsp;J.’s statement about
    the features of a tenancy that distinguish it from a licence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For present purposes, it is important to note that
    Windeyer J.’s discussion of the features that distinguish a tenant from a
    licensee occurred in the context of a broader discussion of the “modern day”
    approach that the English Court of Appeal had been applying in cases such as <i>Errington v. Errington</i>, <i>Cobb v. Lane</i> and <i>Facchini v. Bryson</i>.  Without
    referring to specific cases, Windeyer J. explained at pp. 222-23 the rationale
    behind these decisions and the principle for which they stand:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Recently some transactions from which in the past
    tenancies at <span class=GramE>will would</span> have been inferred have been
    somewhat readily treated as creating only licences. And it has been said –
    especially in connection with family relationships, charity or hospitality –
    that allowing a person to have the exclusive possession of premises does not
    necessarily indicate a tenancy as distinct from a licence. These decisions are
    largely a by-product of rent restriction statutes and other legislation here
    and in England. They are all explicable if they mean, as I think they all do, <i>that persons who are allowed to enjoy sole
    occupation in fact are not necessarily to be taken to have been given a right
    of exclusive possession in law</i>. If there be any decision which goes further
    and states positively that a person <i>legally</i> entitled to exclusive possession for a term is a licensee and not a tenant, it
    should be disregarded, for it is self-contradictory and meaningless. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Windeyer J.’s statement of the law and
    would only add that in general, cases in which persons are allowed to enjoy
    sole occupation in fact, but not as of right in law, will more likely than not
    come within the class of cases envisioned by Denning&nbsp;L.J. in <i>Facchini</i>, such as family arrangements,
    acts of friendship or generosity, or the like. Occupancy pursuant to a contract
    of employment will also fall into the licensee category where the employee
    requires the premises to better perform his duties. See <i>Street v. Mountford</i> at p. 300.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I believe the modern approach makes good sense as a
    matter of policy. Specifically, I see no reason why persons who have been
    permitted to occupy land pursuant to a family arrangement motivated by natural
    affection and generosity should be able to turn around years later and repay
    their benefactor with a claim for possessory title. Consider the case of
    parents who, out of natural love and affection, permit an impecunious child to occupy
    and treat as his or her own, a second home free of charge, only to wake up 11
    years later and find that the second home now belongs to the child and they can
    no longer deal with it as they see fit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of policy, I see no reason why the path to
    acquiring possessory title should be made easy in such circumstances; on the
    contrary, I believe it should be made difficult.  In the context of a claim for possessory title
    involving s. 5(7) of the Act, this can be achieved by looking carefully at the
    intention of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the occupation and
    requiring clear evidence upon which a court can be satisfied, on balance, that
    a tenancy at will was truly created. Strict adherence to the burden of proof
    should be demanded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case at hand is not <span class=GramE>so</span> dramatic as the example involving the parents; however, in my view, the facts
    and circumstances surrounding Duke’s initial occupation of the property and
    Fanny’s occupation of it following his death, favour a finding that Duke and
    Fanny occupied the property as licensees and not as tenants at will. This was a
    family arrangement initiated by Flora and Mercy out of concern for Duke and his
    ability to earn a living. Under the arrangement, Duke would build homes for his
    sisters and for him and his family to live in rent-free, while retaining his
    sense of self-worth by doing maintenance work around the properties and driving
    his sisters to town.  In return, he would
    receive a small amount of spending money.  In some respects, Duke’s role might be equated
    to that of an employee responsible for maintenance – a role he could best fulfill
    by living next door to his sisters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, Duke’s occupation of the property was
    attributable to sibling affection, generosity and employment
    considerations.  In my view, the
    arrangement initiated by Flora and Mercy was clearly personal to him and his wife
    Fanny. In the words of Denning L.J. in <i>Errington</i> at p. 155 and <i>Cobb v. Lane</i> at p. 1202,
    the resulting arrangement and “the circumstances and the conduct of the parties
    show that all that was intended was that the occupier [Duke] should be granted
    a personal privilege with no interest in the land” and certainly none “which he
    could assign or sub-let, and he could not part with the possession to another.”
     The same holds true for Fanny in the
    years that she occupied the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his position that Duke and Fanny occupied
    the property as tenants at will, Hubert makes much of the fact that Flora and
    Mercy permitted a second brother, Charles (not the respondent on this appeal),
    to build a third home on the farm property and upon Charles’ death, they
    conveyed the third home to his wife at her request. Hubert also points out that
    when the province expropriated a strip of land from the property occupied by
    Duke and Fanny, Duke received the proceeds of the expropriation. Hubert relies
    on that payment to show that Duke had an interest in the property and that his
    occupation surpassed that of a mere licensee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, neither factor carries any weight. The
    record is silent as to the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the third
    home to Charles’ widow and for that reason, it is unhelpful. In particular, it
    tells us nothing about the nature of Duke’s occupation – except perhaps to
    demonstrate that Flora and Mercy never intended to convey a legal interest in
    the property to Duke and thus felt free to convey his property to whomever they
    chose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the compensation paid to Duke for the expropriation
    of a strip of land from the property he and Fanny occupied, the evidence
    relating to that transaction is second-hand hearsay and the inference that Hubert
    seeks to draw from it is purely speculative. To the extent that the hearsay
    evidence has any value (a matter not free from doubt), it supports the
    respondents’ contention that the compensation was paid to Flora and Mercy who,
    in turn, used it to pay Duke his monthly stipend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have already mentioned, in finding that Duke and
    Fanny were tenants at will, the application judge focused almost entirely on
    the fact that they enjoyed sole occupation of the property during the relevant
    timeframes.  Admittedly, in Duke’s case, he
    also found that Duke “built the house for himself and treated it as his
    property, improving it on one occasion and maintaining its lawn and garden
    separate from those of his sisters.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I do not quarrel with those findings, they are,
    in my respectful view, either incomplete or inconsequential in deciding the status
    of Duke’s occupation. Unquestionably, Duke built the second home for himself
    and Fanny, but he did so with funds provided by his sisters, and he was
    permitted to live in the home rent free and paid no taxes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for treating the property as his own, there is no
    evidence one way or the other whether Duke sought permission from his sisters
    before making improvements to the property in 1972. The fact that he maintained
    his lawn and garden separate from his sisters says little. It formed part of the
    arrangement with his sisters and, in any event, it simply went to show that he enjoyed
    sole occupation of the property in fact, a finding with which I do not quarrel.
    But, as I have attempted to show, that occupation by itself is not enough to
    create a tenancy at will in the special circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the “family arrangement” cases cited by the
    application judge in which claims for possessory title proved successful, I do
    not see them as helping Hubert. In <i>Train
    v. Metzger</i>, Holland J. found the occupants to be tenants at will, but he
    provided no analysis for that finding and made no attempt to distinguish a
    tenancy relationship from a licensee relationship. In <i>Horne v. Grant</i>, no such analysis was undertaken because s. 5(7) of
    the Act played no part in the decision. The case was decided under s. 4 of the
    Act. (For a case in which the tenancy at will/licensee distinction is discussed,
    see <i>Lehr v. St. Mary River Irrigation
    District</i>, [1993] A.J. No. 1411 (Q.B.) where McBain J. applied the
    modern-day approach and dismissed a possessory title claim on the basis that
    the claimants were licensees, not tenants at will. The case contains a helpful
    review of the factors that give rise to a licence.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, I am satisfied that Duke and Fanny occupied
    the property at all times as licensees and not as tenants at will. At the very
    least, Hubert has not met his onus of showing that a tenancy at will was
    created. The application judge’s finding to the contrary is not entitled to
    deference for the reasons set out above at paras. 40 and 41.  Accordingly, 5(7) of the Act <span
class=GramE>has</span> no application and there is no other basis upon which
    Hubert’s claim for possessory title can succeed.  I would thus reject this aspect of the
    appeal.</p>

    Hubert contends that his father, Duke, should be compensated for the time and
    effort he spent building the second home in which he and Fanny lived.  In support of that contention, Hubert filed an
    affidavit from a realtor, Mr. Kelneck, in which the value of Duke’s labour was

    on the property while living there with Fanny. Hubert again relies on the

    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I

    my view, it was open to the application judge to make those findings.  I see no basis for interfering with them, and
    they support the application judge’s conclusion that a claim for unjust
    enrichment has been made out. </span></p>

    reasonable in the circumstances. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Paragraph 2 of the July 6, 2009
    order requires the respondents Charles and Warren “to pay the estate of Duke MacKinnon
    the sum of $17,000” in respect of the increased value of the land. This creates
    a problem in that the estate of Duke MacKinnon is not a party to the
    application. I would accordingly grant leave to amend the order and substitute
    the estate of Fanny Elizabeth MacKinnon for that of Duke MacKinnon. In all
    other respects, as indicated, I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal.</span></p>
