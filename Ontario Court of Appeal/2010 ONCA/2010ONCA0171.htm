  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May15, 2006, the appellant, hereinafter referred to
    as the Minister, assessed the respondent, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey,
    $64,020.78 for unremitted retail sales tax on the basis that she was a director of <span class=SpellE>Danso</span> Enterprises Ltd. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span> Enterprises was a company owned and incorporated by her brother that had failed
    to remit the tax and which had made an assignment in bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The assessment was made pursuant to s. 43 of the <i>Retail Sales Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    R-31 (RSTA).  Section 43 provides that
    when a bankrupt corporation has failed to remit tax, the directors of the
    corporation are jointly and severally liable with the corporation to pay the
    tax.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The section empowers the Minister to assess
    any person “for any amount payable by the person under this section” and states
    that the sections of the RSTA respecting assessments, objections and appeals
    apply with such modifications as required.  Subsection 43(3) recognizes a “due diligence” defence, in that liability
    is not imposed “if the director exercised the degree of care, diligence and
    skill to prevent the failure [to remit tax] that a reasonably prudent person
    would have exercised in comparable circumstances.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey was never a
    director of the corporation and had no involvement with the company.   Regrettably, through no fault of her own,
    she did not contest liability within the framework of the RSTA.  She did, however, seek and obtain a
    declaration under s. 97 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>,<span style='line-height:200%'> R.S.O. 1990 c. C-43, and rule 14.05(3) of the </span><i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, <span style='line-height:200%'>R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey] was
    never a director of <span class=SpellE>Danso</span> Enterprises Ltd. and [that
    she] is accordingly not liable for the section 43 Retail Sales Tax Act director’s
    liability assessment dated May 15, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In appealing this decision, the Minister submits that
    disputes respecting an assessment under the RSTA must be resolved through the
    process established within the Act, not by applications in the courts. Although
    the Minister now concedes that a Superior Court’s inherent jurisdiction to
    grant discretionary relief is not ousted by the objection and appeal scheme
    contained in ss. 18 - 27 of the RSTA, it submits that that jurisdiction must be
    exercised exceptionally. The Minister further submits that nothing in this case
    warranted the exercise of the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. The Minister
    submits Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey could have raised the
    defence that she was not a director if she had filed a Notice of Objection to
    the assessment within the time limits prescribed in the Act.  Finally the Minister submits that s. 29.1 of
    the RSTA, an amendment which came into force in December 2006, prevented Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey from bringing her rule 14.05(3) application in
    the first place. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the coming into force of s. 29.1 of the RSTA,
    a person had the right to bring an application, pursuant to rule 14.05(3<span
class=GramE>)(</span>d) of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i>, for “the determination of rights that depend on the
    interpretation of a … statute.”  Section
    29.1(5) states that, “[n]o person other than the Minister may bring an
    application under <span class=SpellE>subrule</span> 14.05(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> on or after the
    day this section comes into force, in respect of any matter arising under this
    Act.”  Persons other than the Minister
    can now bring an application only pursuant to rule 14.05(2) that states, “[a]
    proceeding may be commenced by an application to the Superior Court of Justice
    or to a judge of that court, if a statute so authorizes.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister concedes that s. 29.1 is substantive in
    nature.  However, the Minister submits
    that as Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey’s application was brought
    after the date s. 29.1 came into force she was not entitled to bring the
    application. In taking this position, the Minister submits it is not seeking to
    apply the amendment retrospectively.</p>

    application judge’s decision dealt with 3 issues. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    first issue was whether Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey was ever a
    director of the company.  The application
    judge held that she had never been a director. He observed that the <span
class=SpellE>uncontradicted</span> evidence was Ms. Danso-Coffey had been named
    a director of her brother’s company without her knowledge.  Shares of the company were placed in her name
    but she never received them.  She did not
    sign any of the incorporation documents including the consent to act as
    director required by s. 119(9) of the </span><i>Ontario Business Corporations Act</i>, <span lang=EN-US>R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (OBCA). That subsection
    and ss. 10 provide:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to subsection (10), the
    election or appointment of a director under this Act is not effective unless
    the person elected or appointed consents in writing before or within 10 days
    after the date of the election or appointment. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(10) If the person elected or appointed consents in
    writing after the time period mentioned in subsection (9), the election or
    appointment is valid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OBCA makes clear that a person’s consent is
    required in order for the appointment of the person as a director to be
    valid.  Ms. Danso-Coffey was unaware that
    her brother had named her as a director of his corporation and never gave her
    consent in writing. She was not a director in law.  Nor was she a <i>de facto</i> director. S<span lang=EN-US>he
    was never employed by the company. She “had no operational involvement in the
    business at any time, nor did she ever receive any income or benefits from the
    company.”  When she learned she had been
    named as a director and shareholder of the company she retained a solicitor to determine
    if she could be personally liable for the debts of the company.  On her lawyer’s advice, Ms. Danso-Coffey
    filed a Notice of Change form with the Minister of Commercial Affairs, removing
    her registration as a director of the company.  The application judge concluded that Ms. Danso-Coffey was a complete
    stranger to the business, her only connection being her family relationship
    with her brother.  “In these unusual
    circumstances,” he wrote, “it must follow that the applicant cannot be lawfully
    assessed as a director under s. 43 of the RSTA.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue addressed by the application judge was
    whether Ms. Danso-Coffey was able to contest the s. 43 director’s liability
    assessment through the objection provisions of the RSTA.  The application judge held that the statutory
    scheme in the RSTA did not contemplate the defence that the applicant did not
    have the status of director; she had no defences other than the due diligence
    defence in s. 43(3).  There was, in
    effect, a “functional gap” in the RSTA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that there was nothing in
    the RSTA at the material times to prevent the court from exercising its
    inherent and statutory jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief to Ms.
    Danso-Coffey.  He explicitly rejected the
    Minister’s submission that the RSTA is a complete code: “[A]t the time of this
    assessment, the RSTA was not, in my opinion, a sufficiently comprehensive or
    exclusive scheme as to oust this court’s jurisdiction to grant declaratory
    relief.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third issue was whether the court retained the
    discretion to grant the desired remedy in the light of s. 29.1(5), a new
    amendment to the RSTA limiting the ability of taxpayers to bring applications
    for declaratory relief.  Section 29.1(5)
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No person other than the Minister may bring an application
    under subrule 14.05(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure on or after the day this
    section comes into force, in respect of any matter arising under this Act.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The amendment came into force on December 20, 2006, and Ms.
    Danso-Coffey brought her application on February 6, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that the effect of s. 29.1
    on taxpayers’ rights was substantive and, as such, ought not to be given
    retroactive effect.  He concluded that,
    at the material time, there was nothing in the RSTA “...to prevent this court
    from exercising its inherent and statutory jurisdiction to grant declaratory
    relief to the applicant” and that it would be manifestly unfair not to do so.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In making its assessment, the Minister says it was entitled

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister knew that the CIA certificate was only
    based on the unconfirmed information in a CIA return, and had reliable
    information from Ms. Danso-Coffey`s lawyer that a basic precondition to the
    imposition of liability under s. 43 had not been fulfilled at the time it chose
    to issue the Notice of Assessment. However, despite the information rebutting
    the presumption of accuracy, the Minister issued a Notice of Assessment. The
    Minister was not bound by the information provided by Ms. Danso-Coffey. The
    relevant portion of s. 18(7) of the RSTA reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Minister is not bound by… information delivered
    by or on behalf of any person under this Act and may, despite …information so
    delivered,…assess the tax payable under this Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Minister was not bound by the information
    provided by Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey, the Minister’s
    discretion to issue an assessment, like all administrative discretion, must be
    exercised reasonably, not arbitrarily or capriciously.  In this appeal, Ms. Danso-Coffey does not
    allege that the Minister abused its power or that her objection was not taken
    into account. Rather, it appears that the Minister was under the impression
    that in law Ms. Danso-Coffey could not raise the defence that she had never
    been a director.  Accordingly, it issued
    a Notice of Assessment.   The trial judge
    erred in holding that the assessment was unlawful.</p>
  <h3><i>ii)        Was there a “functional gap” in the RSTA?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The letter sent by the Minister on April 19, 2006,
    stated that Ms. Danso-Coffey did not meet the standard of care necessary to be
    exempted from liability under the “due diligence provisions” of the Act. It
    implied that she had not taken all reasonable steps to avoid liability. Before
    the application judge, the Minister submitted that, despite the position taken
    in its April 19, 2006 letter, Ms. Danso-Coffey could have raised the defence
    that she was never a director under the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essence of the application judge’s decision as to
    whether Ms. Danso-Coffey could raise the defence that she had never been a
    director under the RSTA is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>Section 43 of the RSTA imposes a
    joint and several <span class=GramE>liability</span> on directors of a company
    for uncollected or unremitted retail sales tax, but this obligation is clearly
    dependent on the individual having the status of director at the material
    times.  A non-director has no obligations
    under the section.  Furthermore, section
    43(3) places on the director a duty to exercise a “degree of care, diligence
    and skill” to prevent the failure to collect and remit taxes.  It would therefore make no sense to require a
    non-director to establish the statutory due diligence defence because a
    non-director has no obligation of due diligence under the </span>RSTA. <span
lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The comprehensive statutory scheme in the RSTA does
    not contemplate the defence that the applicant did not, in fact, have the
    status of director.  The statutory scheme
    in sections 24 and 25 of the RSTA does not countenance the defence that I have
    found to be factually established before this court that she was never a
    director.  In these unusual circumstances
    it must follow that the applicant cannot be lawfully assessed as a director
    under s. 43 of the RSTA nor can she be said to have any due diligence
    obligation under s. 43(3) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the submission that Ms. Danso-Coffey
    could have raised the defence under the provisions of the RSTA had she done so
    in a timely manner.  In his opinion, the
    RSTA did not “countenance” her defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of its position that there is no functional
    gap in the legislation, the Minister relies on <i>Hay v. Canada</i>, [2004] T.C.C. 51, as precedent for this kind of
    defence.  <i>Hay</i> concerned a decision involving s. 323(1) of the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 c. E-15<span
class=GramE>,  a</span> provision
    virtually identical to s. 43 of the RSTA.  In that case Hay successfully appealed from his assessment for tax as a
    director, through the prescribed statutory objection mechanism, on the basis
    that he had never agreed to act in the capacity of a director. The Tax Appeal
    Court held that as one of the conditions required for the application of s.
    323(1) had not been met, the assessment should be vacated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. London
    Excavators &amp; Trucking Ltd.</i> (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 83,  Catzman J.A. explained, “The defence of due
    diligence may take one of two forms: (1) holding a reasonable belief in a
    mistaken set of facts, and (2) taking all reasonable steps to avoid the
    offending event.”  Here, although Ms.
    Danso-Coffey reasonably believed that she was not listed as a director of her
    brother’s company, she was mistaken.  This would satisfy the first branch of the due diligence defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the application judge erred in concluding
    that there was a “functional gap” in the RSTA.  Ms Danso-Coffey had a due diligence defence in the sense that she had a
    reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts. She could have raised the defence
    that she was never a director under s. 43 (3) as a defence to an assessment
    under the RSTA.</p>

    relief?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge’s declaration that Ms.
    Danso-Coffey did not owe any retail sales tax was premised on his conclusion
    that s. 29.1 of the RSTA did not apply to this case.  I find it unnecessary to examine that
    conclusion because I would allow this appeal even if s. 29.1 did not apply. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister appears to rely primarily on the argument
    that even if the Superior Court retains jurisdiction to grant declaratory
    relief, this was not an appropriate case for the court to exercise its jurisdiction.  I agree with the submission that even if the
    Superior Court had jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief, the application
    judge erred in declaring that Ms. Danso-Coffey was not liable for retail sales
    tax.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering whether the court has jurisdiction to
    grant declaratory relief outside the statutory framework, regard must be had to
    the purpose of the legislation and its wording.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the RSTA is to be a revenue raising
    mechanism; it is also an important policy tool.  See by analogy <span class=SpellE><i>Stubart</i></span><i> Investments Ltd. v. R.</i>, [1984] 84
    D.T.C. 6305 (S.C.C.) at 6323. The values emphasized in fiscal legislation are
    certainty, predictability and fairness.  See <i>Canada <span class=SpellE>Trustco</span> Mortgage Co. v. Canada</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601 (S.C.C.) at para. 12.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister’s position was initially that the RSTA’s
    scheme, which is set out in s. 18 (assessment), s. 24 (notice of objection), s.
    25(appeal), s. 26 (reply to notice of appeal by the Minister) and s. 27(appeal
    procedure) specifically removed the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to grant
    relief outside of the statutory framework.  The RSTA was, in its submission, a “complete code”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its additional submissions filed January 25, 2010,
    in response to the Court’s request, the Minister conceded that the Superior Court’s
    power to exercise its inherent jurisdiction in granting discretionary relief is
    not ousted by these sections of the RSTA, citing the following comparable
    cases: <i>The</i> <i>City of Toronto v. Olympia Edward Recreation Club Ltd.</i>, [1954] O.R.
    14 (C.A.) at paras. 6-10; <i>Canada v.
    Addison &amp; <span class=SpellE>Leyen</span> Ltd.</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 793, at
    paras. 7-11, <span class=SpellE>rev’g</span> [2006] 4 F.C.R. 532 (F.C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the court’s inherent jurisdiction to grant
    declaratory relief is not to be exercised in a vacuum.  As Morawetz J. observed in <i>Scion Capital LLC v. Goldfields</i> (2006),
    15 B.L.R. (4th) 331 (S.C.J.), at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Inherent jurisdiction is a power derived from the
    very nature of the court as a superior court of law, permitting the court to
    maintain its authority and to prevent its process being obstructed and
    abused.  <span class=GramE>In <span
class=SpellE><i>Stelco</i></span><i> Inc., Re,</i> the Court of Appeal, at para.</span> 35, states:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>In spite of the expansive nature of this power,
    inherent jurisdiction does not operate where Parliament or the legislature has
    acted.  As Farley J. noted in Royal Oak
    Mines, supra, inherent jurisdiction is “not limitless; if the legislative body
    has not left a functional gap or vacuum, then inherent jurisdiction should not
    be brought into play.  [Citations
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A functional gap in the legislation is an example of a
    jurisprudential reason for the court to exercise its inherent
    jurisdiction.  As discussed above, the
    application judge erred in finding that there was a “functional gap” in the
    RSTA.  Ms. Danso-Coffey was entitled to
    object to the assessment by way of a due diligence defence under s. 43(3) of
    the RSTA.  Thus, there was no
    jurisprudential reason for the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to
    grant a declaration. Simply because Ms. Danso-Coffey’s lawyer missed the time
    limits within which to object to the Minister’s assessment or to request a
    review of its decision, does not mean that the Superior Court judge should have
    exercised his inherent jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Superior Courts must be cautious in exercising their
    jurisdiction in order to preserve the efficacy of the system of tax
    assessments.  They should respect the
    structure set up by the legislature and not develop a new form of incidental
    litigation. See by analogy: <i>Canada v.
    Addison</i> at paras. 8 and 11 cited below:   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_8">[8] </a>We need not engage in a lengthy theoretical discussion on
    whether s. 18.5 can be used to review the exercise of ministerial discretion.
    It is not disputed that the Minister belongs to the class of persons and
    entities that fall within the Federal Court's jurisdiction under s. 18.5. Judicial
    review is available, provided the matter is not otherwise appealable. It is
    also available to control abuses of power, including abusive delay.
    Fact-specific remedies may be crafted to address the wrongs or problems raised
    by a particular case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_11">[11] </a>Reviewing courts should be very cautious in authorizing
    judicial review in such circumstances. The integrity and efficacy of the system
    of tax assessments and appeals should be preserved. Parliament has set up a
    complex structure to deal with a multitude of tax-related claims and this
    structure relies on an independent and specialized court, the Tax Court of
    Canada. Judicial review should not be used to develop a new form of incidental
    litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax appeals established by Parliament
    and the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. Judicial review should remain a remedy
    of last resort in this context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the RSTA is a complete code in the
    strict sense of that term, the application here was a direct challenge to the
    validity of an assessment and the provisions of the RSTA govern such
    challenges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the legislature has specified precisely what
    conditions must be satisfied to achieve a particular result, it is reasonable
    to assume that the legislature intended that taxpayers would rely on such
    provisions to achieve the result they prescribe. Even absent words clear enough
    to oust the court’s jurisdiction, I would infer that the legislature intended
    disputes concerning the validity of an assessment of tax to be resolved within
    the RSTA. Thus the application judge erred in declaring that Ms. Danso-Coffey
    was not liable for retail sales tax.</p>
  <p><b>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The declaration that Ms. Danso-Coffey was
    never a director</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the application judge’s declaration that
    Ms. Danso-Coffey was never a director. I would uphold that declaration. The
    Minister accepted that the RSTA is not relevant to the respondent's request for
    a declaration that she was never a director of the company. This position can
    only be based on an implicit acknowledgment that the Superior Court did have jurisdiction
    to make that declaration pursuant to s. 97 of the Courts of Justice Act and
    that the declaration is not “any matter arising under this Act” pursuant to s.
    29.1(5) of the RSTA.  At para. 56 of its
    factum, the Ministry states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ontario submits that if it is determined that a
    matter is outside of the RSTA regime, then none of the provisions of the
    statute, including s. 29.1, has any application, whether the provision is read
    retroactively or prospectively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the unchallenged evidence concerning
    the respondent’s lack of involvement with the corporation and in the light of
    the position taken by the Minister, I see no reason to interfere with the
    application judge’s declaration that the respondent was never a director of the
    company.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because Ms. Danso-Coffey was never a director of the
    company, a precondition for the imposition of liability under s. 43(3) was not
    met. Nonetheless the original assessment remains valid because of s. 18 (8).  Section 18(8) provides: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An assessment, subject to being varied or vacated
    on an objection or appeal and subject to a reassessment, shall be deemed to be
    valid and binding despite any error, defect or omission therein or in any
    proceeding under this Act relating thereto. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the original assessment under the RSTA was valid and

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This does not mean that the declaration that Ms.
    Danso-Coffey was never a director has no effect as the Minister submits.  The factual basis on which the assessment was
    made no longer exists.  Ms. Danso-Coffey
    can thus ask the Ministry to reassess her having regard to the combined
    operation of s. 43 and s. 18(3) of the RSTA.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 43(4) of the RSTA, which provides for
    assessment of any amount payable by a person who is a director, makes the
    sections of the Act apply “with such modifications as the circumstances
    require.” Section 18, which deals with assessments,  provides as follows in the relevant portion
    of ss. (3):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The Minister may…assess or <i>reassess</i> any tax payable under this Act…by a purchaser…within four
    years from the day such tax became payable. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, a necessary modification would be to read
    the word “director” for “purchaser”. The tax became payable by Ms. Danso-Coffey
    when the Notice of Assessment was sent to her on May 15, 2006.  Thus, Ms. Danso-Coffey would have until May
    15, 2010 to ask the Minister to reassess her (or to execute a voluntary waiver
    of the time limit in the RSTA for reassessment).  Section 18(8) of the RSTA states that “an
    assessment, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal and
    subject to a reassessment, shall be deemed to be valid and binding despite any
    error, defect or omission therein or in any proceeding under this Act relating
    thereto.” Thus, a reassessment could vary or vacate the original assessment.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also disagree with the Minister’s submission <span
class=GramE>that,</span> based on the combined operation of the CIA and the OBCA<i> </i>it is still entitled to rely on an
    evidentiary presumption that Ms. Danso-Coffey was a director.  In order to appreciate the Minister’s
    argument I will briefly outline the sections on which it relies.  Section 2(1) of the CIA requires a
    corporation to file an initial return as prescribed.  Section 1.1 of R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 182,
    requires that a return set out the names and addresses for service of the
    corporation`s directors, the date on which each became a director, and the date
    on which a director ceased to be a director.  Section 20 authorizes the Minister of Consumer and Business Services,
    currently the Minister of Government Services, to issue a certificate or to
    certify any fact in the CIA.  Section 21
    states that the Minister may accept the information contained in any return or
    notice filed under the CIA without making any inquiry as to its completeness or
    accuracy. In addition the Ministry relies on the presumption in s. 262(3)  of the OBCA which  provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A director named in the articles or the most recent
    return or notice filed under the Corporations Information Act, or a predecessor
    thereof, is presumed for the purposes of this Act to be a director of the
    corporation referred to in the articles, return or notice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a declaration by the court that Ms.
    Danso-Coffey was never a director would rebut any such presumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, if the Minister persists in relying on the
    presumption, s. 250(1) of the OBCA permits rectification in cases such as this.
    It provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the name of a person is alleged to be or have
    been wrongly entered or retained in….the registers or other records of a
    corporation, ….any aggrieved person may apply to the court for an order that
    the registers or records be rectified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that Ms. Danso-Coffey would be an
    “aggrieved person” and that she could bring an application, on notice to the
    Minister, for rectification under s. 250 of the OBCA and rule 14.05(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> which permits
    an application to the Superior Court if, as here, a statute so authorizes.   She may also obtain recourse under s. 248 of
    the OBCA which is the oppression remedy.  See e. g. <i>Di Battista et al. v.
    874687 Ontario Inc. </i>(2005), 80 O.R. (3d) 136, where the court’s inherent
    and equitable jurisdiction was invoked; and see also <i>Flatly v. <span class=SpellE>Algy</span> Corp (<span class=SpellE>c.o.b</span>. <span class=SpellE>Mazzrow’s</span> </i><span style='line-height:200%'>(2000),<span class=Heading3Char> </span><span
style='color:black'>100 A.C.W.S. (3d) 411,</span></span> per <span
class=SpellE>Swinton</span> J.  The fact
    that this court has upheld a declaration that she was never a director would
    surely assist such an application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that Ms. Danso-Coffey’s motivation for seeking
    rectification at this stage is that she has been assessed for retail sales tax
    does not preclude rectification if it is appropriate. In <i>Aim Funds Management Inc. v. Aim <span class=SpellE>Trimark</span> Corporate Class Inc.</i>, [2009] O.J. No. 4798, (Ont. <span class=SpellE>S.Ct</span>.), <span class=SpellE>Perell</span> J. granted the equitable remedy of a
    rectification order to amend management and distribution contracts and held, at
    para. 10, “…it will be for the tax courts to decide if GST is payable or not
    based on the rectified contracts.”  The
    parties themselves wanted the amendments and brought the application but it was
    opposed by the Attorney General of Canada because rectification would affect
    the factual basis on which GST assessments had been made for 26 years.  At para. 7 of his reasons, <span class=SpellE>Perell</span> J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Aim Funds</i> conceded that its request for rectification was motivated by the adverse GST
    consequences associated with the numerous contracts and by a series of tax
    assessments delivered by Canada Revenue Agency, but the Applicant submits that
    the motivation for rectification of the contracts is not the reason or grounds
    for rectification. To rebut the Attorney General’s argument, the Applicant says
    that the advantageous tax consequences of the rectified contracts would simply
    be an incident of the agreement it originally negotiated but that was
    incorrectly expressed in the written contracts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case rectification of the register would
    correctly express the fact that Ms. Danso-Coffey was never a director.  Furthermore, an application for rectification would
    not run afoul of s. 29.1(5) of the RSTA, as it is not an application for a
    “matter arising under the [RSTA]”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the business records of Danso Ltd. are rectified,
    the Minister will have no basis upon which to ground the presumption that Ms.
    Danso-Coffey was a director of that corporation.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Last Resort</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the Minister refused to reassess Ms. Danso-Coffey
    and persisted in trying to collect over $64,000 from her, I note that she
    could, as a last resort, seek an exemption pursuant to s. 9(1) of the RSTA that
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>9(1) If, owing to special circumstances, it is
    deemed inequitable that the whole amount of tax imposed by this Act be paid,
    the Minister may, with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council,
    exempt a purchaser from payment of the whole or any part of such tax. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The procedures discussed above respect the scheme of
    the Act while at the same time recognizing, as the application judge did, that
    the equities in this case clearly favour the taxpayer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It may be that the Minister’s position was only with
    respect to whether the original assessment should be upheld and that that
    position did not take into consideration the possibility of a reassessment. I
    would hope that that is the case. The Court requested further submissions on
    the issue of rectification and the <i>Aim <span
class=SpellE>Trimark</span></i> decision. How rectification fits into the
    entire scheme was not argued before us. However, I am comfortable in making the
    comments I have because they are <span class=SpellE>precatory</span> in nature,
    do not affect the outcome of the appeal, and Ontario, unlike an ordinary
    litigant, <span class=GramE>does</span> not seek to win or lose but to see that
    justice is done.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons given above, while I would allow the Minister’s appeal with respect
    to the application judge's declaration that the respondent is not liable for
    the company's retail sales tax arrears, I would uphold the declaration that Ms.
    Danso-Coffey was not a director.  Although
    that declaration does not affect the validity of the assessment, the factual
    basis for assessment of Ms. Danso-Coffey in her personal capacity has changed
    and, within the scheme of the RSTA, the Minister has a basis to reassess Ms.
    Danso-Coffey.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>T<span lang=EN-US>he</span> Minister has been successful on the main aspect of this appeal. Costs in favour
    of the Minister are fixed in the amount of $16,000.00 inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T. as agreed by counsel. The costs awarded by the
    application judge to Ms. Danso-Coffey are set aside. If counsel cannot agree on
    the Minister’s costs below they may be assessed.</p>

  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=ParaNo0><b>Juriansz J.A.
    (Concurring):</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I concur with my colleague Weiler J.A. that the
    Minister’s appeal should be allowed and the declaration that Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey was not liable for retail sales tax set
    aside.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view s. 29.1 of the RSTA applied to Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey’s application, a question that Weiler J.A.
    found it unnecessary to decide.  Section
    29.1(5) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No person other than the Minister may bring an
    application under <span class=SpellE>subrule</span> 14.05 (3) of the Rules of
    Civil Procedure on or after the day this section comes into force, in respect
    of any matter arising under this Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The words “on or after the day this section comes into
    force” are clear.  In choosing these
    clear words, the legislature was obviously aware that any application brought
    on the day the section came into effect would pertain to matters that arose
    earlier.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey
    brought her application on February 6, 2008, a date more than a year after s.
    29.1 came into force on December 20, 2006.  The legislative intent is clear and the court must give the words their
    intended effect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I see no issue about the retrospective
    application of s. 29.1 in the circumstances of this case.  The fact that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey
    sought a declaration regarding tax liability that arose before s. 29.1 came
    into effect does not make its application retrospective.  At the time she brought her application for a
    declaration there was no longer a live controversy about the validity of her
    tax assessment. She brought her application almost 2 years after she was
    assessed under the RTSA, about a year and a half after the time for filing an
    objection expired, and almost a year after the time limit for seeking an
    extension of time to file an objection had elapsed.  The determination of her tax liability was a
    closed transaction.  Without considering
    s. 29.1 Weiler J.A. has determined, and I agree, that the legislature intended
    disputes concerning the validity of an assessment of tax to be resolved within
    the RSTA.  It follows that Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey did not have any right, let alone the vested
    right, to bring an application to have her tax assessment declared
    invalid.  The application of s. 29.1 to
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey’s application does not change the
    future consequences of any completed transaction.  It cannot be said s. 29.1’s application to
    this case is retrospective.  The
    application judge erred by not finding that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey
    was not properly before the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also observe that even if the application judge
    could have properly exercised jurisdiction to grant Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey
    a declaration determining her tax liability under the RSTA, he should have
    declared she was liable for the tax assessed.  Rule 14.05 (3) did not give the application judge the authority to make
    a declaration that was contrary to the law plainly set out in s. 18(8).    The assessment was deemed valid by s. 18(8)
    of the RSTA.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons I concur with Weiler J.A.’s
    conclusion that this appeal must be allowed and the declaration that Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey is not liable for the tax assessed must be set
    aside.  I agree with Weiler J.A. that the
    declaration that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey was never a
    director of the taxpayer corporation need not be set aside.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I do not acquiesce in the discussion Weiler
    J.A. undertakes after concluding the appeal must be allowed.  I do not see it as my role to seek to assist
    one of the parties before it by, in effect, offering legal advice.  The recourse that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Danso</span>-Coffey
    may yet have and the statutory provisions upon which she might apply are not issues
    pertinent to this appeal.  I would also
    refrain from commenting on the equities of the case.  Time limits and limitation periods serve a
    valuable function in the legal process by promoting finality.  The fact that time limits and limitation
    periods are to the detriment of parties who miss them does not affect the
    equities, in my view. </p>
