    Gonder.  The testatrix left a life estate
    in the Hamilton property to her mother, who is still living but no longer able
    to stay in the house.  The will further
    directed that the residue of the estate was to be divided equally among the testatrix’s
    mother, sister and brother. </span></p>

    responsibilities and financial stress.  Ms.
    Evans is in ill health and Mr. Evans has considerable obligations in caring for

    Ontario indicated, in response to an inquiry from respondents’ counsel, that it
    does not intend to become involved in the Gonder estate.  While respondents’ counsel also asked an
    institutional trustee whether it would be willing to act, the respondents did
    not file an affidavit suggesting a replacement trustee or file a written consent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span style='line-height:200%'>REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge found that continued service as estate
    trustees would work substantial hardship on the respondents, both physically
    and financially, and that through no fault of their own, they now have a conflict
    of interest with the heirs because they have become creditors of the estate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge held that there was nothing preventing him
    from ordering that the respondents be removed as executors of the estate.  He concluded that s. 37 of the <i>Trustee Act</i> does not require a trustee
    to provide a replacement before applying to be removed.  While s. 37(4) “gave [him] pause”, he
    concluded that the provision “is aimed at the situation in which one of several
    trustees is removed.  Such a trustee need
    not be replaced, because the remaining trustees can act.  <i>That is
    not the same thing as saying that the last remaining trustee cannot be removed
    until a replacement is available</i>” (emphasis added). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge also relied on <i>Mitchell v. Richey</i>, [1867] 13 Gr. 445 (U.C. Ch.), for the
    proposition that no person can be compelled to remain a trustee. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>He observed that what is left to be administered is a vacant
    house that is subject to a tax lien and a certificate of pending litigation.  He justified discharging both of the respondents
    on the basis that they are not in a position to do anything meaningful since
    the litigation by the appellant prevents them from selling the house and the
    tax lien prevents them from settling the litigation.  In his view, little was lost by discharging
    them.  The motion judge further noted
    that a litigation administrator could be appointed to deal with the litigation
    over the Hamilton property.  He did not
    explain how it would be possible to find a litigation guardian to act, and not
    a replacement estate trustee.   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Having concluded that in these circumstances the respondents
    had made out a case for removal, the motion judge ordered that the respondents’
    certificate of appointment as executors be revoked under r. 75.04 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194, and that they be removed as trustees pursuant to s. 37 of the <i>Trustee Act</i>.</span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         Governing
    principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law of trusts is a creature of equity and the
    Courts of Chancery.  In exercising its
    equitable jurisdiction, a court must ensure that fairness is done for all
    parties.  Equity is “the soul and spirit
    of all law ... equity is synonymous with justice”: William Blackstone, 2 <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i>, 2d
    ed. (Chicago: Callaghan &amp; Co., 1879), at p. 429.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The role of trustee is a difficult one.  A trustee must act in the best interests of
    the beneficiary, even at personal hardship.  However, if such obligations were unlimited, and if no relief were
    available, “no one would undertake the task of trusteeship”: see Donovan W.M.
    Waters, <i>Waters Law of Trusts in Canada</i> 3d ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2005), at p. 841.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the specific circumstances of this case there were
    three objectives that ought to have been considered and addressed by the motion
    judge: (1) ensuring the orderly administration of the estate in the interests
    of the beneficiaries; (2) recognizing the plight of the respondents; and (3)
    providing for the timely resolution of the disputes concerning the estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the interests of the beneficiaries must be the
    primary concern of both trustees and the courts, as we see it, the courts can
    meet each of these concerns, and do justice to all of the parties without
    requiring that a replacement trustee be immediately appointed, so long as there
    are steps taken to ensure the proper administration of the estate.  We reach this conclusion based on the following:
    First, the courts have historically exercised an inherent equitable
    jurisdiction to remove trustees, even if it would, for a period, leave no
    trustee to administer the estate, so long as provision was made for the
    estate’s orderly administration.  Second,
    no statute has removed this power. Finally, there may be reasonable
    alternatives to the immediate appointment of a new trustee that can ensure the
    proper administration of the estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred not because he removed the
    respondents as trustees without appointing a replacement.  Rather, the error was to remove them without
    making alternate provisions for the proper administration of the estate.  It is for this reason alone that the matter
    must return to the Superior Court to be reconsidered.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        Equitable
    Powers</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The courts have long recognized an inherent power to
    remove a trustee when circumstances require.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Letterstedt</i></span><i> v. Broers</i> (1881), 9 A.C. 371 (P.C.),
    Lord Blackburn stated, at pp. 386-87:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]f it appears clear that the continuance of the
    trustee would be detrimental to the execution of the trusts, even if for no
    other reason than human infirmity would prevent those beneficially interested,
    or those who act for them, from working in harmony with the trustee...it seems
    to their Lordships that the Court might think it proper to remove him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In exercising so delicate a jurisdiction as that of
    removing trustees, their Lordships do not venture to lay down any general rule
    beyond the very broad principle above enunciated, that their main guide must be
    the welfare of the beneficiaries.  Probably
    it is not possible to lay down any more definite rule in a matter so
    essentially dependent on the details often of great nicety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When a sole remaining trustee was removed, the courts
    normally required a replacement trustee to be appointed.  However, this was not intended to impose an
    additional burden to a trustee seeking to retire: see <i>Courtenay v. Courtenay </i>(1846), 3 Jo. &amp; Lat. 519, at p. 533.  Where no replacement could be found by the
    retiring trustee, the court could take it upon itself to ensure a continued
    administration.  In cases from that era,
    the court would attempt to locate new trustees itself: see <i>Gardiner v. Downes</i> (1856), 22 Beav. 395, 52 E.R. 1160.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, the court could take steps to obviate
    the need for a trustee.  In <i>Mitchell v. Richey</i>, Mowat V.C. permitted
    a sole surviving trustee to retire without appointing a replacement.  Rather, he ordered that a receiver previously
    appointed by the court be continued, and that the trust funds be paid into
    court to be administered for the good of the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case of <i>Barker
    v. Peile</i> (1865), 2 Dr. &amp; Sm. 340, 62 E.R. 651 illustrates the court’s
    power to deal with an estate in the best interests of the beneficiaries in
    circumstances similar to the instant appeal.  The case was summarized in the English Reports, at p. 651, in the
    following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It appeared that the Plaintiff was the surviving
    trustee of a voluntary settlement – that the trust fund had always been an
    ascertained fund, but that many questions had arised among the parties claiming
    the fund, and several suits had been instituted with reference to the
    settlement, to all of which the Plaintiff had been made a party.  The Plaintiff, under these circumstances,
    being desirous of avoiding further annoyance with regard to the fund,
    instituted the suit for administration of the fund by the Court, asking to be
    discharged, and, if necessary, that new trustees of the settlement might be
    appointed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that case the court ordered the discharge of the
    trustee in these circumstances, and took on the duty of administering the trust
    itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue in their factum that “[s]ince
    trusts must be continuously administered, there cannot be a suspension of
    trustee administration” and cite Gillese J.A.’s text on trusts as authority.  It is worth setting out the passage that they
    refer to in its entirety:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Trusts must be continuously administered: there can
    be no hiatus in the administration of a trust.  At all times there must be a trustee, <i>or someone that the law designates as standing in his or her stead</i>,
    with responsibility for the administration of a trust. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'>See Eileen E. Gillese, <i>The Law of Trusts</i> (Concord: Irwin Law, 1997), at p. 123.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the appellant’s assertion, this passage
    confirms that there are situations where a trust, while still requiring
    administration, will lack a trustee to fulfill this role. While rare, this
    situation is not the impossibility that the appellant asserts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We recognize that there is good reason to ordinarily
    require a replacement trustee to be located.  The fiduciary nature of the trustee role ensures that they “put the
    beneficiary’s interests first in the performance of any act and the exercise of
    any powers or duties”: see Gillese, at p. 130.  History has proven that trustees are effective actors in ensuring that
    the estates of deceased persons are administered properly.  When a trustee wishes to resign, it will
    ordinarily fall to that person to locate a replacement trustee.  The modern reality is that the court is ill
    suited to locate replacements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as we will discuss below, a trustee is not the
    only entity that can ensure the proper administration of an estate.  In the very rare cases where equity demands
    that a sole trustee be removed, but no replacement is forthcoming, courts
    possess an inherent jurisdiction to order the trustee’s removal and provide for
    the orderly administration of the estate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to these alternatives, we will consider
    the effect that modern legislation has on the inherent jurisdiction that we have
    described above.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      Legislative
    provisions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our system of democracy, Parliament and the
    legislatures, acting within their constitutional limits, are sovereign.  The Legislative Assembly of Ontario is
    entitled, if it so wishes, to override the common law (including principles of
    equity) and replace it with statute.  Alternatively,
    they may pass legislation that complements common law rules and powers without
    overriding them.  In the case of the <i>Trustee Act</i>, the legislature has not
    granted a positive power to remove a sole remaining trustee.  As we will explain below, however, neither
    has the legislature removed the inherent power of the courts to do so in
    limited circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant effectively argues that the legislature
    has in fact overridden this inherent jurisdiction with the <i>Trustee Act</i>.  He says that
    the judicial replacement of estate trustees is now governed entirely by s. 37
    of that Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>37. (1) The Superior Court of Justice may remove a
    personal representative upon any ground upon which the court may remove any
    other trustee, and may appoint some other proper person or persons to act in
    the place of the executor or administrator so removed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The order may be made upon the application of
    any executor or administrator desiring to be relieved from the duties of the
    office, or of any executor or administrator complaining of the conduct of a
    co-executor or co-administrator, or of any person interested in the estate of the
    deceased.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) Where the executor or administrator removed is
    not a sole executor or administrator, the court need not, unless it sees fit,
    appoint any person to act in the place of the person removed, and if no such
    appointment is made the rights and estate of the executor or administrator
    removed passes to the remaining executor or administrator as if the person so
    removed had died.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that s. 37(4) clearly establishes
    that where the court removes a sole executor, a replacement must be appointed.  If this were not the case, then why set out
    in statute that, where an executor is removed and there <span class=GramE>is</span> one or more remaining executors, no replacement is required?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would reject this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor Sullivan notes that there is a strong
    presumption, especially in cases of private law, against statutory provisions
    ousting traditional common law rules:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is also presumed that legislatures do not intend
    to interfere with common law rights, to oust the jurisdiction of common law
    courts, or generally to change the policy of the common law.  As explained in <span class=SpellE><i>Halsbury</i></span>, in a formulation
    adopted by many Canadian courts:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Except in so far as they are clearly and
    unambiguously intended to do so, statutes should not be construed so as to make
    any alteration in the common law or to change any established principle of law.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This assumption is likely to apply to any
    legislation dealing with so-called “private law – the law of contracts, torts
    and private property... Finally, certain matters are subject to the inherent
    jurisdiction of the courts.  It is
    doubtful that legislatures could succeed in fully ousting this jurisdiction.</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'>See <i>Sullivan
    on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2008), at
    pp. 431-32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Trustee Act</i> is not a complete code.  It does not
    provide for a comprehensive system for the administration of trusts.  In 1984, the Ontario Law Reform Commission
    released a seminal report on reforming the law of trusts as part of a
    comprehensive review of the law of property: see Ontario Law Reform Commission, <i>Report on the Law of Trusts</i> (Toronto:
    O.L.R.C. Rep., 1984).  In their report,
    the Commission considered, and rejected the notion of a codification of the law
    of trustees, preferring a statute that supplemented and clarified the
    judge-made law of trusts: see <i>Report on
    the Law of Trusts</i>, at pp. 12-15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More particularly, commentators widely accept that
    superior courts of equitable jurisdiction have an inherent power of appointment
    and removal that exists in parallel with provisions such as s. 37 of the <i>Trustee Act</i>: see Gillese, at p. 125;
    Waters, at p. 818; <i>Report on the Law of
    Trusts</i>, at pp. 86-87; Carmen S. Theriault ed., <i>Widdifield on Executors and Trustees</i>, 6th ed., looseleaf (Toronto:
    Carswell, 2002), at 15.2.2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we read it, s. 37(4) does not constrain the power of
    the court to remove a sole remaining trustee and provide for an alternative mechanism
    for administering the trust in those rare cases where a replacement trustee is
    not available and the exercise of inherent jurisdiction is required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of s. 37(4) is to give the court discretion
    to decide not to replace a removed trustee when one or more trustees remain.  In other words, there is no obligation to
    ensure that the “status quo” is maintained by appointing a replacement.  In the spirit of simplifying the trusteeship
    regime, s. 37(4) also provides for how the powers and rights of the removed
    trustee devolve in the event that he or she is not replaced.  The authority of the removed trustee vests in
    the remaining trustees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such a clarification is understandable.  Older decisions, such as <i>Mitchell</i>, express a judicial preference against moving from
    multiple estate trustees to a single trustee on the premise that a testator’s
    choice to appoint more than one trustee initially represents a desire to avoid
    their estate falling into the control of a single person: see <i>Mitchell</i>, at p. 449.  This may be a relevant consideration in
    appropriate circumstances.  Section 37(4)
    merely provides that such considerations need not predominate in all cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, it appears to me that no single provision
    of the <i>Trustee Act</i>, <span
class=GramE>nor</span> the Act as a whole, ousts the inherent equitable
    jurisdiction of the court to remove a trustee. This is true even if such a
    removal would leave the trust without a trustee, so long as the court ensures p<span
lang=EN-US>roper administration of the <span
class=GramE>estate <span lang=EN-CA> in</span></span></span> the best interests of
    the beneficiaries.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      Administration
    of the Trust</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the record before him, the motion judge found that
    the respondents have made a compelling case to be discharged as trustees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not interfere with the motion judge’s finding
    in this respect.  Given the combination
    of their age, Margaret Evans’ state of health, their residence in British
    Columbia, and the difficulties and expenses involved in dealing with a claim
    being advanced by the appellant, responsibility for the administration of this
    estate appears to have become unduly burdensome.  In our view, the motion judge’s finding on
    this issue is reasonable and ought to be given deference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we agree with the motion judge that, in
    exceptional circumstances, the court has the jurisdiction to remove a sole
    trustee without appointing a replacement, this power may only be exercised
    where an alternative mode of administration can be put in place that secures
    the best interests of the beneficiaries and ensures that the estate’s assets
    are properly maintained.  The motion
    judge, in removing the respondents without providing for proper administration,
    committed an error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of this error, this matter must be remitted to
    the Superior Court to reconsider the removal application.  Any order made then must protect the
    interests of the beneficiaries and take into account and facilitate the timely
    resolution of the underlying litigation over title to the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While not strictly necessary for the disposition of
    this appeal, we will suggest potential options for addressing these issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent that the fundamental issue that divides
    these parties is the ownership of the house, the only asset of the estate.  Is it property of the appellant or is it the
    property of the estate? The house is of modest value and both the cost of
    maintaining it and legal fees are rapidly accumulating to the point that,
    however the dispute as to ownership is resolved, there will be little if
    anything left for the winner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Compounding these problems is the fact that there is no
    one to tend to the upkeep of the house.  Katherine <span class=SpellE>Gonder</span>, the property’s life tenant, is ill and no
    longer able to either occupy or use the home as contemplated by the will.  The appellant lives in the Yukon, and while
    he claims an equitable interest in the home for himself and his children, he
    does not appear to have been paying for its carriage nor tending to its care.
    As discussed above, the respondents are in no position to prevent the asset
    from wasting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant’s counsel
    advised the court that the appellant’s son has, though a form of “self help”
    moved into the house and is conducting some repairs and clean up of the
    property.  The respondents, given their
    location, health issues and financial means do not appear to have taken steps
    to assert the estate’s ownership of the property or prevent the son from acting
    in this manner.  While the son’s conduct
    may involve some maintenance of the property, there is no evidence as to the
    efficacy of these efforts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the estate’s limited value is being
    consumed by both the costs of litigation, waste due to ineffective upkeep of
    the trust property, mounting expenses such as taxes and maintenance, and the
    failure to provide for rental income.  Surely
    this is not in the interests of the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge had before him two motions: one for
    removal, and another for directions.  In
    the latter motion, the respondents sought to have the court order the sale of
    the home.  While the motion judge
    dismissed the motion for directions as moot, having already released the
    respondents from their trusteeship, for the reasons given above, this was not
    the correct approach.  Without commenting
    on the merits of the motion for directions, the difficulties caused by the
    removal of the respondents as estate trustees might have been addressed by an
    order for a sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A practical impediment to the sale of the home is the
    presence of a certificate of pending litigation registered on title.  So long as it remains, no one would
    realistically purchase the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a new motion for removal, the respondents might
    renew the request to sell the property and seek an order discharging the
    certificate.  This should be done on
    notice to all potentially interested parties and may require additions to the
    record.  As an equitable instrument, a
    certificate may be discharged by the court “on any ... ground that is
    considered just”: see <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 103(6<span class=GramE>)(</span>c).  On such a motion, “the Judge must exercise
    his discretion in equity and look at all of the relative matters between the
    parties in determining whether or not the certificate should be vacated”: see <i>Clock Investments v. Hardwood Estates Ltd. <span
class=GramE>et</span>. al.</i> (1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 671 (Div. Ct.), at p. 674.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because no motion was brought under r. 42.02 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, for a
    discharge of the certificate, there is insufficient information before the
    court to speculate on whether the equities would ultimately favour a discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a sale of the property proves to be an available
    option because of a discharge, there are at least two mechanisms by which a
    sale could be realized.  First, the will itself
    provides Katherine Gonder the authority to “at any time direct [the] Estate
    Trustees to sell [the house] and the proceeds of such sale shall revert to and
    form part of the residue of [the] estate.” Katherine Gonder has not been part
    of the proceedings below.  We are simply
    not aware of whether she has been approached to approve a sale or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the respondents could renew the motion for
    directions that the motion judge found moot, in which they sought a judicial
    order for the sale of the property.  The
    respondents had sought such an order from Goudge J.A. on the appellant’s motion
    to extend time to appeal to this court.  <span
class=SpellE>Goudge</span> J.A., while commenting that a sale of the home
    seemed reasonable, felt that the appropriate procedure would be to bring a
    separate motion for directions.  It
    appears that the respondents have brought such a motion before the Superior
    Court, returnable in mid-March.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once sold, the court could ensure the proper administration
    of the estate by ordering the funds to be into court pursuant to s. 36(1) of
    the <i>Trustee Act</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>36. (1) Where any money belonging to a trust is in
    the hands or under the control of or is vested in a sole trustee or several
    trustees and it is the desire of the trustee, or of the majority of the
    trustees, to pay the money into court, the Superior Court of Justice may order
    the payment into court to be made by the sole trustee, or by the majority of
    the trustees, without the concurrence of the other or others if the concurrence
    cannot be obtained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the funds from a sale of the home were paid into
    court, concerns related to physical maintenance and property taxes would be
    resolved, and the beneficiaries would be free to litigate or settle any claims
    they might have. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second potential option would be to address the
    problems that the life <span class=GramE>interest in the house are</span> currently creating by resort to the court’s inherent “salvage and emergency
    jurisdiction”: see Waters, at pp. 1293-96.  The court possesses an inherent jurisdiction to vary the terms of a
    trust in support of the settlor’s intentions when circumstances “might
    ‘reasonably be supposed to be one not foreseen or anticipated’ by the <span
class=GramE>testator,</span> or one where his trustees were ‘embarrassed by the
    emergency’”: see <i>Tornroos v. Crocker</i>,
    [1957] S.C.R. 151, at p. 158.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a proper factual record, various events might be
    shown to have been unforeseen by Pearl <span class=SpellE>Gonder</span>.  Conversely, on further evidence, it may be
    apparent that none of the subsequent events would have been unexpected.  Potentially relevant considerations might
    include litigation over the estate in which one of the beneficiaries contended
    that the sole asset of the estate was not truly part of the estate at all;
    Katherine Gonder’s illness; the presence of a certificate of pending litigation
    that impairs Katherine Gonder’s power of sale under the will; the conflict of
    interest that the trustees created by becoming creditors of the estate; and the
    serious risk of waste of the estate’s sole asset.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exercising this power, the court may be in a position
    to bypass Katherine Gonder’s life interest and allow the estate to vest with
    the three beneficiaries, with title to the home held jointly between them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This solution would avoid the need to address the
    certificate of pending litigation or the tax lien on the home, allow for any
    beneficiary interested in maintaining the property to do so legitimately, and
    to preserve ownership of the property such that, if the appellant’s claim were
    ultimately found meritorious, he could obtain title to the property rather than
    money damages.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The removal of a sole trustee without appointment of a
    replacement is an extreme remedy, and will be inappropriate in most cases.  It will only be available when no other
    option is realistically available.  In our
    view, given the limited value of the estate, the conflict of interest that the
    respondents are now in as creditors of the <span class=GramE>estate,</span> and
    the lack of viable replacement trustees, this is one such exceptional case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> the motion judge
    was wrong to remove the respondents as trustees without also crafting a
    mechanism by which the estate could continue to be administered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a case that cries out for a practical solution.  It is in that spirit that the judge hearing
    this matter should approach the task.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The suggestions for solutions that we have outlined
    above are merely that: suggestions.  Nothing
    in these reasons should be read as preventing the motion judge from finding
    other equitable mechanisms for ensuring the proper administration of the estate
    and the protection of the interests of the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On further evidence, it may be clear that some of these
    options are illusory, while other as of yet not contemplated solutions may
    exist.  What is necessary is that,
    together with any order removing the trustees, there must be an order that
    protects the best interests of the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also note that the true core of the dispute in this
    case is between the appellant and the respondents in their capacity as
    beneficiaries, not as trustees.  The
    dispute should proceed with this reality in mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking all these circumstances into account, in our view,
    the appropriate order is that the appeal be allowed and remitted to the
    Superior Court to consider the application for removal in conjunction with a
    motion for directions assessing how to administer the estate.  Any person having a claim to the property or
    the estate should be served with the motion for directions and this judgment.  We would order that the issue of the costs of
    the motion under appeal be reserved to the judge hearing the motion.  We would make no order as to the costs of the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given our finding on the first issue raised by the
    appellants, it is unnecessary to comment on the passing of accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regrettably, this disposition resolves very little and
    essentially remits the matter to the Superior Court for resolution.  Given the amounts at issue and the cost of
    further litigation, this appears to be a case that cries out for early
    resolution and some form of consensual out-of-court resolution.  If the parties are prepared to consider that
    avenue and require the court’s assistance, we may be approached through the
    Registrar to make appropriate arrangements.</p>

    36(7) of the <i>Trustee Act</i> may also
    have relevance. It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>36. (7) Where a
    trustee desires to be relieved from the trust, the court may order all property
    held for the trust to be transferred to the Public Trustee.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>It appears to allow for the transfer of property such
    as the house to the Public Guardian and Trustee. We do not express a view as to
    whether the section would allow the court to make such an order. In any event,
    it may well be that in the circumstances of this case where the property is the
    subject of a <span class=GramE>claim,</span> this option is not to be preferred
    as it would result in an increase in costs and complexity.</p>
