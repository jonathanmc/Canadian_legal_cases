  <p class=Style1>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake (“NOTL”),
    has been party to a series of agreements with a jet boat tour operator since
    1992.  These agreements permit the tour
    operator to make use of a dock under the control of the town for the purposes
    of operating its tour ride along the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niagara River.  It is a popular tourist attraction and draws
    thousands of visitors every year.  This
    appeal arises from a successful application to quash the by-law authorizing the
    most recent agreement. The application was brought by the respondent to this
    appeal, a special interest group incorporated as the Niagara River Coalition
    (the “Coalition”). </p>

  <p class=Style1>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Niagara Gorge Jet Boating Ltd. (“Jet Boat”) operates a
    popular tourist attraction known as the Whirlpool Jet Boat Tours along the
    Niagara River.  In doing so, Jet Boat
    makes use of the Melville Street Dock (the “Dock”), owned by NOTL.  Since 1992, the Jet Boat operation has used
    the Dock under a series of licence agreements with NOTL.  The first licence agreement (the “1993 Licence
    Agreement”) was for a period of ten years and authorized under a by-law passed
    by NOTL (the “1993 By-law”).  Under the
    1993 Licence Agreement, Jet Boat was granted a licence to use the Dock for the
    purposes of loading and unloading passengers, refuelling and overnight docking.
     In January 2002, a second license
    agreement was entered into for a period of eight years (the “2002 Licence
    Agreement”).  The 2002 Licence Agreement
    added the restriction that Jet Boat <span class=GramE>dock</span> a maximum of
    three boats and was authorized under a by-law (the “2002 By-law”).  On
    <st1:date Year="2008" Day="11" Month="2"
w:st="on">
    February 11, 2008, the by-law at issue in this appeal was
    passed authorizing the third licence agreement.  I will refer to these respectively as the 2008
    By-law and the 2008 Licence Agreement.</p>

    Federal Crown Grant of Letters Patent, and is currently owned by NOTL.  In December 1962, the Dock was leased to the
    Federal government for a period of 99 years, for use as a customs entry
    point.  The Dock was operated by
    personnel of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (“CCRA”) until 1989,
    following which persons who wished to gain entry into
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    via boat
    made use of a telephone at the Dock to report to the CCRA.  These persons were not allowed to tie up at
    the Dock, and instead made docking arrangements elsewhere.  The CCRA telephone was removed from the Dock
    prior to 1992, and persons entering the country by boat made use of a phone at
    the Sailing Club.  From 1989 to 1991 the
    Dock was used by small pleasure boats touring the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niagara
    River, following which the Dock was locked, unused, and in disrepair
    until 1992.</span></p>

    basis, to use the Dock for its tour operation of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niagara
    River.  Soon after, formal
    long-term agreements were entered into between NOTL and Jet Boat licensing the
    use of the Dock.  These agreements were authorized

    the agreement between NOTL and Jet Boat was authorized on February 11, 2008,
    when NOTL passed the 2008 By-law that is the subject of this appeal rescinding

    the Dock to other white-water boating operations.  The 2008 Licence Agreement acknowledged
    NOTL’s intention to develop a Community Plan for the Dock area during its
    term.  In doing so, however, the
    Agreement also provided for a yearly extension of the licence (beyond March 31,
    2013) if the Community Plan was not completed by April 1, 2011.  Any such extensions were to be subject to an
    agreed upon increase in fees.</span></p>

    2008 By-law was contrary to NOTL’s Plan and void on that basis, as it
    contravened s. 24(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  He found that Jet Boat ran an intense,
    private and commercial operation that did not fit within the “Conservation” designation
    under the Plan.</span></p>
  <p class=Style1><span

    use of the Dock was impermissible under the Plan, the application judge concluded
    that the Dock use could not constitute a “park” – a permitted land-use under
    the “Conservation” designation.  In doing
    so, he relied on a passive understanding of the word “park” drawn from the case
    law.  The application judge also relied
    on the evidence of Mr. John Perry, the former town planner and drafter of the Plan,
    who testified that the “Conservation” designation under the Plan was meant to
    recognize passive parks and public open space.  The application judge further held that the Dock’s fence, together with
    the inability of the general public to access the Dock without purchasing a
    ticket, thwarted the public access policies espoused in NOTL’s Plan.  </span></p>
  <p class=Style1><span

    consider whether or not the 2008 By-law authorized a use of the Dock that could
    be permitted to continue as a “non-conforming use” under the Plan.  He defined such a permissible use as an
    existing use, lawfully established in accordance with the zoning by-laws of
    NOTL, as of the date the Plan was adopted.  The application judge concluded that the Jet Boat operation, as licensed
    at the time the Plan was adopted, was not such an existing use as it was not
    permitted under NOTL’s zoning by-law designating the Dock area “Institutional”.  </span></p>

    argument that since the Dock was used as a dock by the CCRA, and is currently
    used as a dock by Jet Boat, the licensed use of the Dock is therefore a permitted
    use or a legal non-conforming use.  He
    found instead that the nature and intensity of Jet Boat’s operation
    significantly exceeded the use of the Dock when it was in the hands of the CCRA
    from 1962-1991.  As a result, he held
    that the nature of the Dock’s use had so dramatically intensified, its
    character was now an “altogether different use” (relying on <i>Saint-Romuald (City) v. Olivier</i>, [2001]
    2 S.C.R. 898) and was incapable of maintaining any possible status of legal
    non-conforming use.</span></p>

    that upon commencement of the 1993 Licence Agreement, the use made of the Dock

    the 2008 By-law, the application judge held that NOTL had unlawfully “disposed”
    of the Dock, contravening s. 270(1) of the <i>Municipal

    Court in <i>2015429 Ontario Ltd. v. Dynasty
    Homes (Wasaga Hills) Ltd.</i> (2006), 270 D.L.R. (4th) 401, he found that the
    word “sale” enjoys a wide ambit, and that the Disposition Policy of NOTL
    applied to the 2008 Licence Agreement.  NOTL
    did not consider the Disposition Policy applicable, and therefore did not apply
    it in respect of the licensing of the Dock. </span></p>

    2008 Licence Agreement remained in force, Jet Boat enjoyed a monopoly. </span></p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'><b><span style='line-height:200%'>Issues</span></b></p>
  <p class=Style1>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises four issues on this appeal:</p>
  <p class=Style1>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, does the 2008 By-law contravene s. 24(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, by licensing a use of the
    Dock not permitted under the “Conservation” designation assigned to the Dock under
    NOTL’s Plan?</p>
  <p class=Style1>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, if the licensed use of the Dock does not conform
    to NOTL’s Plan, may the current use of the Dock continue as an “Existing
    Non-Complying Use” under the Plan?  </p>
  <p class=Style1>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, was the 2008 Licence Agreement an unlawful
    disposition of the Dock, contrary to s. 270(1) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=Style1>d.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, does the 2008 Licence Agreement authorized by
    the 2008 By-law confer on Jet Boat an exclusive right in the nature of a
    monopoly to carry on its business at the Dock, contrary to s. 18 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=Style1>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also raised an argument on appeal that
    the interpretation of the Plan by the application judge offends the doctrine of
    paramountcy:  that the application
    judge’s construction of the Plan created a constitutional conflict between the
    Plan and applicable federal legislation pertaining to navigation and
    shipping.  The respondents were not
    called upon in respect of this issue as, in our view, it lacked merit.  In any event, as this case can be disposed of
    on the municipal law grounds, this argument need not, and should not, be
    considered, as emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of
    Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy)</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97.</p>
  <p class=Style1>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the essence of this appeal lies in the
    second issue. Prior to dealing with that issue, however, it would be useful to
    review the salient facts.</p>
  <p class=Style1>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Dock has been a hub of marine commercial activity
    since the 1830s. There has been no general public access to the Dock since at
    least 1962, commencing with the lease to the Federal government.  In 1992, the Dock lease was re-acquired from
    the Federal government.  At the time, the
    Dock was not accessible to the general public. </p>
  <p class=Style1>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to build the townhouses on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Melville Street, an amendment to the Plan
    was necessary to change the designation from “Marine Commercial” to “Medium
    Density Residential”.  The change was
    opposed by NOTL and a hearing was conducted before the Board.  Central to the issue before the Board was the
    compatibility of the residential townhouse development with the existing
    commercial activity in the Dock area, and in particular with the Jet Boat operation.  </p>
  <p class=Style1>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board ultimately ruled that the amendment should be
    granted. On the issue of compatibility, the Board stated: “Based upon an
    analysis of the detailed evidence by the planners, the architect/urban
    designer, and the operating partner of the jet boat business, <u>the Board
    finds that the proposed dwellings would not cause an unacceptable adverse
    impact upon the existing jet boat business.</u>” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Style1>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The status of Jet Boat as a party to the hearing was
    contested by the applicant developer. The Board determined that Jet Boat was a
    proper party, but there is no reference in the decision to any issue relating
    to the legality of the 2002 By-law under which Jet Boat was operating at the
    time.  </p>

  <p class=Style1>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained in more detail below, the interpretation
    of an official plan is a matter of law; therefore, the applicable standard of

  <p class=Style1>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first question the application judge addressed was
    whether the 2008 By-law contravenes s. 24(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, by licensing a use of the Dock not permitted under
    the “Conservation” designation assigned to the Dock under NOTL’s Plan. Section
    24(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p>24. (1) Despite any other general or special Act,

    the Board on
    <st1:date Year="1998" Day="21" Month="10" w:st="on">
    October 21,
    1998.  The Plan remains in
    effect today.  The Plan designates the
    Dock area for “Conservation” land use, a land use designation that “applies to
    lands considered environmentally significant”.  The goals and objectives of such land use include: to increase public
    access to the Niagara River; to prevent damage to the Niagara River shoreline;
    and, to preserve and enhance the amenities and natural resources offered by the
    waterways.  Among its permitted “Main
    Uses” are “public and private parks”.</span></p>
  <p class=Style1>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his consideration of the proper interpretation of
    the Plan, the application judge admitted and relied upon the evidence of Mr. John
    Perry, the former town planner responsible for drafting the Plan.  </p>
  <p class=Style1>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this was improper, and that
    the application judge ought to have applied the accepted rules of construction
    of legislation when interpreting the text of the Plan. </p>
  <p class=Style1>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the thrust of the appellant’s submission
    that the evidence is inadmissible. However, the appellant approaches the issue
    from the perspective that official plans are akin to legislation. This is not
    the case. As stated by this Court in

    determined on the basis of the documents that comprise such plans.  In this instance, the application judge
    relied on opinion evidence that was inadmissible to determine the scope and
    meaning of the language used in the Plan.  As a result of this error, I am not prepared to accept his finding that
    Jet Boat’s use of the Dock could not shelter under the Plan’s “Conservation”
    designation and would set it aside.  In
    light of the answer I would give to the second issue, it is unnecessary to
    address any further the question of whether or not the licenced use of the Dock

    presently comply with this concept and that this situation is likely to persist
    for a long time. Moreover, many of these uses have been established for a
    considerable number of years and frequently a large measure of stability has
    been obtained between them and their neighbours. While a conscious planning
    program would not seek deliberately to foster a mixture of uses that were
    believed to be detrimental to each other, it must be recognized that there are
    many existing situations that can be tolerated in the interim without serious
    adverse results.</p>
  <p><u>The Plan, therefore, while endeavouring to obtain a high degree of land use
    compatibility for new development, intends that there be a greater degree of

    point:  the expressed intention of the “greater
    degree of leeway” applicable to non-complying land use in areas of existing
    development.  Subsection (1) of the
    Non-Complying Uses provision of the Plan goes on to state that “[w]here a
    property has an existing use of land that does not comply with the land use
    designation shown in this Plan, <u>or to any other applicable policy in this
    Plan</u> it may, notwithstanding the policies of this Plan, be zoned for the

    conclusion that the Jet Boat operation was an existing, non-complying use
    permissible under the Plan.   The
    application judge erred in concluding otherwise. This error was the result of
    his reading into the language of the definition two limiting elements. First,
    he confined the scope of “By-law” to zoning by-laws. Second, as evident from
    paras. 96 and 97 of his reasons, he also determined that a by-law, to be
    lawfully established, had to “conform” to the Plan.  With respect, each of these elements adds a requirement
    that is not expressed in the plain words of the Plan.</span></p>

    by the language used in the Plan. There is no indication of what is, on the
    interpretation of the application judge, essentially a double qualification
    test. The requirement is that the land use be lawfully established pursuant to
    a by-law. There is nothing that indicates that the inquiry should then proceed

    Street townhouse development. That development did
    not exist until 14 years after the CCRA operation had ceased at the Dock. It is
    difficult to see how the CCRA operation could have any relevance to the
    issue.  At the time of the application,
    the compatibility question concerned only the Jet Boat operation, which had
    been in operation at that point for approximately ten years. There is no
    evidence that the operation of Jet Boat had changed, except in volume. Accordingly,
    the application judge’s reliance on the </span>Supreme Court of Canada’s

    municipal land. In January 2008, NOTL adopted a “Disposition Policy” for
    municipal property that stated that prior to selling any land the town council
    would declare it to be surplus. The applicant argued successfully that NOTL
    failed to comply with its Disposition Policy as it did not declare the Dock to

    the use made by Jet Boat.  The 2008
    Licence Agreement contemplates termination through the implementation of a
    Community Plan for the dock area; however, the Agreement also allows for its
    automatic extension on a year to year basis in the event that the Community

     Moreover, a licence is an agreement to

    rights to itself under the 2008 Licence Agreement, and presumably would have

    history of marine and commercial use. That is the heritage of the

    there is no current history of unfettered public access. The Board considered
    all of the relevant factors in allowing the amendment to the Plan that led to
    the construction of residential units proximate to the Dock. It is telling that
    there were no challenges to the legality of Jet Boat’s Dock use at that time,
