  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can the court compel an employer to commence
    proceedings to wind up a pension plan?  This appeal answers that question.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1966, Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> Limited (“Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span>”) established a pension plan for its salaried
    employees (the “Pension Plan”).  Funds
    contributed to the Pension Plan were to be held in trust.  Accordingly, Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> entered into a trust agreement with Montreal Trust Company as trustee (the
    “1966 Trust Agreement”).  The pension
    plan text (the “1966 Plan Agreement”) was attached to the 1966 Trust Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Both the 1966 Trust Agreement and the 1966 Plan
    Agreement provide that no part of the trust fund is to be used for, or diverted
    to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the employee members of
    the Plan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Effective August 1, 1997, the Pension Plan was changed
    from a defined benefit (“DB”) plan to a plan with both a DB and a defined
    contribution (“DC”) portion. Members as of that date were given a one-time
    opportunity to switch from the DB to the DC portion of the Plan.  Members admitted after <span class=GramE>that
    date were</span> eligible only for the DC portion of the Pension Plan.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Alexander E. Lomas (the “applicant”) has retired from
    employment with Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span>.  While employed, he was a salaried employee
    and contributing member of the Pension Plan.  He brought an application in which he seeks $2,000,000.00 in damages, as
    well as other relief, including that which forms the subject of this appeal.  He seeks to represent the members of the DB
    portion of the Pension Plan and others who may benefit from this proceeding as
  a result of their prior membership in the DB portion of the Pension Plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant alleges that Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> has unilaterally and surreptitiously amended the Pension Plan to the detriment
    of plan members. He also claims that at various times before 1999, contrary to
    the original terms of the Pension Plan and in breach of trust, contract and
    fiduciary duty, Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> and its officers and
    directors wrongfully diverted millions of dollars from the Pension Plan.  Specifically, he alleges that Rio <span
class=SpellE>Algom</span>:  failed to
    contribute funds due and payable under the Pension Plan; failed to administer
    or cause the trustee to administer the Pension Plan for the benefit of the
    beneficiaries; managed and administered the funds contrary to the 1966 Trust
    Agreement and the 1966 Plan Agreement; and, failed to make annual payments to
    fund the current service costs of the Pension Plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> brought a motion to
    strike paras. 1(h), 1(i)(i) and (ii), and 2(y) of the Amended Notice of
    Application (the “Amended Application”) as disclosing no reasonable cause of
    action.  For ease of reference, those
    paragraphs of the Amended Application are set out below.  Para. 1(i<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) is
    struck to reflect that part of the motion judge’s order from which no appeal
    has been taken.  For convenience, I will
    refer to the balance of the paragraphs in question as the “impugned
    paragraphs”.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         The
    Applicant makes an application for:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(h)       <span class=GramE>an</span> Order
    determining:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    present value of the assets of the Trust Fund;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>the amount
    actuarially required to provide the pension and other benefits required to be
    paid to the persons named in paragraph 1(a) hereof in accordance with the terms
    of the Pension Plan,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>and directing that the
    Respondents make an application under section 68 of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i> for the partial winding-up of the Pension Plan
    and the distribution of the assets to the persons entitled thereto in
    conformity with the other determinations and declarations sought herein;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        <span
class=GramE>in</span> the alternative to the relief sought in paragraph 1(h),
    above:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an
    Order for the purchase by the Trustee of annuities, policies of insurance or
    other instruments actuarially sufficient to ensure the payment of all pension
    and other entitlements due under the Pension Plan;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><s>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></s><s>an Order
    for the winding up of the Pension Plan and distribution of its remaining or
    residual assets to those entitled thereto in accordance with the Pension Plan;</s></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         The
    grounds for the application are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (y)       The
    value of assets of the defined benefits portion of the Pension Plan is
    substantially in excess of the amount actuarially required to provide pension
    benefits to those entitled <span class=SpellE>thereunder</span>. The class of
    persons who are beneficiaries of the defined benefits portion of the Pension
    Plan is closed and the members of the class are determinable. No good purpose
    will be served by delaying the distribution of the surplus assets of the
    Pension Plan to those entitled to share in the distribution of the residual
    assets of the Trust Fund, after making provision for the payment of the pension
    and other benefits due to the persons entitled thereto. The surplus of the
    Trust Fund should be the subject of a partial wind-up under the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, so that the value
    may be distributed to the persons entitled thereto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the motion was scheduled but before it was heard,
    the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in <i>Buschau v. Rogers Communications Inc.</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 973.  Based on <i>Buschau, </i>the applicant conceded that he could no longer seek the relief set out in
    subparagraph 1(i<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) of the Amended Notice, which
    asked the court to directly order the wind up of the Pension Plan.  However, he maintained that <i>Buschau </i>did not preclude the court from
    ordering the employer to commence wind up proceedings pursuant to s. 68(1) of
    the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.8 (the “<i>PBA</i>”).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The motion judge accepted the applicant’s submission.  By order dated December 22, 2006 (the “Initial
    Order”), he struck the claim for a court ordered wind up of the Pension Plan
    (para. 1(i)(ii)) but dismissed the balance of the motion, thus leaving the
    impugned paragraphs operative.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the motion judge reasoned as follows.  The application calls on the court to
    determine and declare the rights of Pension Plan members.  If the court finds that wrongs have been
    committed, it has the power to fashion an appropriate remedy.  Whether it has the jurisdiction to order Rio <span
class=SpellE>Algom</span> to apply for a wind up is a novel question.  However, the applicant is not asking the
    court to assume the supervisory role of the Superintendent of Financial
    Services (the “Superintendent”) or the Financial Services Tribunal (the
    “Tribunal”).  Rather, the request is for
    an order compelling Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to do something that
    the <i>PBA </i>permits it to do – apply for
    a wind up under s. 68<i>.  </i>If that occurred, “the Superintendent
    would then oversee the subsequent and remaining steps in the winding-up
    process.”  Assuming that a finding is
    made that the rights of the Pension Plan members have been breached, the court
    is the best forum to determine the remedy.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> sought leave to
    appeal to the Divisional Court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated May 8, 2007, <span class=SpellE>Carnwath</span> J. granted leave on the basis that the decision of the motion judge appeared to
    be in conflict with <i>Buschau</i>.  He stated that in <i>Buschau</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the courts have no
    jurisdiction to order the wind up of a pension plan.  The effect of the Initial Order, however, was
    to permit the impugned paragraphs to remain in the pleading and those
    paragraphs ask the court to order Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to wind up
    the Pension Plan by way of application to the Superintendent.  Thus, he said, the effect of the Initial
    Order was to permit the court to do indirectly what it could not do directly.  Resolving this matter is of public importance
    because the Initial Order implies that there could be concurrent schemes for a pension
    plan wind up – the statutory scheme and a court-ordered scheme.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court heard Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom’s</span> appeal on October 18, 2007.  A majority
    of the Divisional Court (Lane and <span class=SpellE>Kitely</span> JJ.) were of
    the view that the motion had been properly decided and the impugned paragraphs
    should be permitted to remain in the Amended Application.  Justice Murray dissented.  By order dated January 24, 2008 (the “Order”),
    Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom’s</span> appeal to the Divisional Court was
    dismissed.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> appeals to this
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, largely for the reasons given
    by Murray J. in dissent.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DIVISIONAL COURT DECISION  </span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US></span><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Majority Decision</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority decision in the Divisional Court (the
    “majority decision” or the “majority”) affirmed the Initial Order.  Like the motion judge, the majority did not
    view <i>Buschau</i> as having addressed
    whether the court can compel an employer who has been found to be in breach of
    its obligations to commence wind up proceedings under the <i>PBA</i>.  In the majority’s view, <i>Buschau</i> focussed on the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i> (1841), Cr. &amp;
    Ph. 240, 41 E.R. 482 (Ch. D.), and not on the general question of the role of
    equity and trust law in relation to the pension benefits legislative scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority viewed the relief sought in the impugned
    paragraphs as compelling a wrongdoer to remedy its wrongdoing by taking a step
    expressly contemplated by the <i>PBA</i>,
    namely, an employer exercising its right to apply for a partial windup.  Remedies for breach of trust are fact
    dependent.  Thus, the majority reasoned, a
    determination of the appropriate remedy requires a fuller record than that
    which is available on a motion such as this.  If restitution – an equitable remedy – can be achieved only by a
    mandatory order requiring the wrong-doer to act as permitted by statute, there
    is no policy reason to prevent that.  The
    victims of the wrongdoing may also have access to a remedy by means of a
    request to the Superintendent but that does not affect their rights in trust
    law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority concluded by stating that the motion judge
    correctly held that it was not plain and obvious that the applicant could not
    succeed on the pleading as written.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US></span><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Dissent</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Murray would have struck the impugned
    paragraphs on the basis that they were prohibited by <i>Buschau</i>.  In his view, <i>Buschau </i>stands for the proposition that pension
    plan members have no right to compel the wind up of a defined benefit pension
    plan and they cannot circumvent the wind up provisions of the pension
    legislation by seeking a court order compelling the employer to wind up the
    pension plan.  Therefore, he stated, it
    is not open to the court to order an employer to wind up a pension plan at the
    request of plan members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Murray J. also concluded that the impugned paragraphs
    could not remain because they contemplate relief that is inconsistent with the
    scheme of the <i>PBA</i>.  There is no provision in the <i>PBA </i>that permits plan members to make an
    application for plan termination or wind up.  As the Supreme Court noted in <i>Buschau</i>,
    if pension plan members have concerns about possible violations of the trust
    and plan, they are to alert the Superintendent.  And, as was also pointed out in <i>Buschau</i>,
    because employees in an organisation come and go, they have only a “passive and
    limited right with regard to employer decisions concerning the future of their
    plan and trust fund”.  Granting an order
    on behalf of plan members to compel the employer to apply for a plan wind up is
    inconsistent with those “passive and limited rights”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, Murray J. reasoned, under the <i>PBA</i> only the employer and the
    Superintendent have the right to terminate a pension plan.  The allegations raised in the Amended
    Application are all matters that the Superintendent is entitled to take into
    account in determining whether to take steps to wind up the pension plan.  The court has no jurisdiction to perform the
    duties imposed on the Superintendent by the legislature.  It ought not to act in a manner that negates
    the expertise of a statutorily appointed regulator.  For the court to order – at the request of
    plan members – Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to terminate the DB Pension
    Plan would be an unauthorised usurpation of the authority delegated by the <i>PBA</i> to the Superintendent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Murray J. found that such an order would also
    interfere with the appeal process under the legislation.  Under the <i>PBA</i>,
    a proposal to wind up made by the Superintendent can be appealed to the
    Tribunal<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  If the court requires an employer to apply
    for a wind up, the statutory appeal process is not available and the employer will
    have been deprived of its appeal rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of these reasons, Murray J. concluded that it
    was plain and obvious that the court did not have the authority to order the
    relief requested in the impugned paragraphs. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE</span></h4>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>AN OVERVIEW OF WHY THIS APPEAL MUST BE ALLOWED  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority decision of the Divisional Court is explicitly
    founded on the premise that <i>Buschau </i>does
    not address the issue in this appeal, namely, whether the court can compel an
    employer who has been found to be in breach of its obligations to commence wind
    up proceedings under the <i>PBA</i>.  The majority views <i>Buschau</i> as having focussed on the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i> and not on the more general question of the
    role equity and trust law in respect of the pension benefits legislation.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I disagree.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rule in <i>Saunders
    v. Vautier </i>enables trust beneficiaries, in certain circumstances, to end
    the trust and force the distribution of the trust property.  It is correct that in <i>Buschau</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that members of a pension
    plan cannot use the rule to terminate a pension trust.  However, I agree with Murray J. that <i>Buschau </i>is not confined to that narrow
    proposition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Buschau</i>,
    the Supreme Court makes it clear that the court does not have the authority to
    compel an employer to wind up a pension plan at the request of members of the
    pension plan because to do so would be contrary to:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.  the societal purposes for which pension plans
    exist;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii. the scheme
    of the legislation that governs pension plans; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii. <span
class=GramE>the</span> language usually found in pension plan documentation
    giving the employer the right to terminate the trust and pension plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering an employer to commence wind up proceedings
    under s. 68 of the <i>PBA </i>is tantamount
    to ordering the wind up of the pension plan.  Because the court cannot do indirectly that which it cannot do directly,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a> <i>Buschau </i>makes it “plain and obvious”
    that the court does not have the authority to order an employer to commence
    wind up proceedings under s. 68 of the <i>PBA</i> at the request of plan members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with Murray J. that such an order runs
    contrary to the legislative provisions governing the wind up of private pension
    plans in Ontario.  If the Superior Court
    of Justice were to order Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to commence wind
    up proceedings, it would violate the scheme of the <i>PBA </i>and the <i>Financial
    Services Commission of Ontario Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c. 28 (the “<i>FSCOA”)</i>, and amount to an unauthorized
    usurpation of the authority delegated to the Superintendent and Tribunal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following examination of <i>Buschau </i>and the relevant legislation will explain the foregoing
    conclusions and why this appeal must be allowed. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>BUSCHAU </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>EXAMINED <i>    </i></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts <i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1974, Premier Communications Ltd. established a
    defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of its employees (the “Plan”).  The Plan provided that in the event of
    termination, surplus was to be distributed among the remaining members.  The Plan funds were held in a trust (the
    “Trust”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan was governed by the <i>Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, </i>R.S.C. 1985 (2d Supp.), c. 32
    (the “<i>PBSA</i>”).  There are no material differences between its
    relevant provisions and the corresponding ones in the <i>PBA</i> in respect of the matters in issue in this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rogers Communication Inc. (“RCI”)<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> acquired Premier Communications Ltd. in 1980.  In 1981, RCI amended the Plan to provide that on its termination,
    surplus would revert to it.  In 1984, RCI
    closed the Plan to new employees.  In
    1992, RCI retroactively merged other of its pension plans with the Plan.  By 2002, the Plan had an actuarial surplus of
    $11 million. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much litigation ensued over the Plan.  The court determined, among other things,
    that although the merger of the pension plans was valid, it did not affect the
    existence of the Trust as a separate trust.  It also held that the members of the Plan retained the right to any surplus
    funds that remained on Plan termination.<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan members wanted the surplus so they applied to
    the court for an order terminating the Plan.  They relied on the rule in <i>Saunders
    v. Vautier</i>, which provides that if all of those persons who are beneficially
    entitled to the trust property are of full legal capacity and agree, they may
    modify or extinguish the trust without reference to the wishes of the settler
    or trustee.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  The Plan members argued that the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier </i>allowed them to
    terminate the Trust even though the Plan documentation provided that only the
    employer had that right.  They argued,
    alternatively, that RCI should be required to wind up the Plan under the <i>PBSA</i>.  They maintained that because the Superintendent’s power to terminate the
    Plan was discretionary, they had no clear recourse under the <i>PBSA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The British Columbia first instance and appeal courts held
    that the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier </i>applied
    and could be used to enable the Plan members to collapse the Trust.  The Supreme Court of Canada reversed that
    decision.         </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Majority Decision in <i>Buschau</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Deschamps wrote for the majority.  She gave a number of reasons for holding that
    the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier </i>does
    not apply to pension trusts, which I would group and summarize as follows.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the rule in <i>Saunders
    v. Vautier </i>is incompatible with the context and purpose of pension plans.  Pension plans serve broad societal
    goals.  Together with government programs
    and individual savings, they provide an aging population with invaluable
    financial support.  Recognizing the
    economic and social importance of pension plans, Parliament and a majority of the
    provincial and territorial legislatures have adopted legislation regulating
    them.  Permitting the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i> to operate would
    defy the application of the <i>PBSA</i>, which
    deals extensively with the wind up of pension plans and the distribution of
    assets.  It is clear that Parliament
    intended the <i>PBSA </i>provisions to
    displace the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i>.  The <i>PBSA</i> provides a means to reach the distribution stage – it prevails over the rule.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gift or legacy trusts are gratuitous – accelerating the
    date of the beneficiaries’ entitlement has no broad social consequences.  However, the capital of the pension trust
    fund cannot be distributed without defeating the social purpose of preserving
    the financial security of employees in their retirement by allowing them to
    receive periodic payments until they die.  Furthermore, before a pension plan is wound up, surplus is only an
    actuarial concept. While the plan is in operation, individuals entitled to the
    surplus assets do not have a specific interest in them.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[11]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A pension plan, if not a permanent instrument, is at
    least a long-term one.  The participation
    of any individual member is ephemeral – members come and go while pension plans
    are expected to survive the flow of employees and corporate
    reorganizations.  In an ongoing pension
    plan, a single group of employees should not be able to deprive future
    employees of the benefit of a pension plan.  Thus, members often have only a passive and limited right with regard to
    employer decisions concerning the future of their plan and trust fund.  They are not left without recourse should the
    employer infringe the <i>PBSA</i> because
    they can alert the Superintendent to their concerns.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[12]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, unlike other trusts, pension trusts are not
    stand-alone instruments.  They serve only
    as the vehicle for holding and managing the funds of the pension plan.  In the present case, the Trust agreement is
    made part of the Plan and is dependent on the Plan for which it was
    created.  The two instruments are
    therefore indissociable.  Pension trusts
    cannot be terminated without taking into account the provisions in the pension
    plan documentation and the legislation that governs the pension plan.  While there are no indirect effects which
    arise on the application of the rule in <i>Saunders
    v. Vautier </i>to other types of trusts, that is not the case with pension
    trusts.  Application of the rule would
    end a pension trust but it would not deal with termination of the pension plan.  However, termination of the pension plan in accordance
    with the <i>PBSA</i> is a condition
    precedent to distribution of the assets held in the pension trust.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, while classic trust law allows no room for the <span class=SpellE>settlor’s</span> intention, treating employers as having no interest
    in the pension trust conflicts with the usual expectations of the parties to the
    pension plan.  Neither the Plan nor the
    Trust agreement gives the members a right to terminate the Plan.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the rights of pension plan members are subject
    to the provisions of the <i>PBSA</i>.  While the <i>PBSA </i>is not a complete code, when recourse to it is available, plan members should
    use it.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>PBSA </i>deals
    explicitly with pension plan wind up.  It
    gives the Superintendent a key role in the termination and distribution stages
    of a pension plan wind up.  For the
    members to get the surplus, the Plan must first be terminated.  Since the Plan does not provide for them to
    terminate it, the members can ask the Superintendent to consider ordering a partial
    Plan wind up.  The Superintendent is in
    the best position to determine whether there is any legitimate purpose to be
    served by permitting a pension plan to continue or whether it should be wound
    up.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class=SpellE>Bastarache</span> wrote the
    minority decision in <i>Buschau</i>.  He concluded that the Plan members could not
    use the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier </i>to
    collapse the Plan or Trust for reasons similar to those given by the
    majority.  Those reasons can be
    summarised as follows.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>PBSA </i>is a
    comprehensive statutory scheme structured to further the public policy
    objective of enhanced financial security for workers on their withdrawal from
    the active workforce.  Within this
    comprehensive scheme, there are detailed provisions for the termination of
    pension plans and the distribution of plan assets.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span

    voluntary nature of the private pension plan system, employers are generally
    entitled to terminate a pension plan, a matter expressed in most plan
    documents, including the Plan.  This
    right is recognized in the <i>PBSA</i>.  The Superintendent is also given the power to
    terminate pension plans in certain specified situations.  There is no provision in the <i>PBSA </i>for plan beneficiaries to terminate
    a pension plan.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"

    of realizing on the actuarial surplus in the fund in violation of the terms of
    the Plan.  In this Plan, absolute
    entitlement to the surplus would only occur once the surplus became real, that
    is, once the Plan and Trust had been terminated.  This is because the members only have a
    contingent interest in the Trust surplus which does not vest until the Plan is
    terminated.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"

    circumstances, there could be no reasonable expectation on the part of the
    employer or Plan members that the Trust could be terminated by the members over
    the objections of the employer.  The
    application of the rule in <i>Saunders v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have set out the reasons in <i>Buschau </i>at some length to demonstrate that it stands for the
    general proposition that, absent language in the pension plan documentation to
    the contrary, pension plan members have no right to compel the wind up of a
    defined benefit pension plan.  The
    reasoning of the Supreme Court in <i>Buschau</i>,
    as summarized above, </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE>shows</span> that the Court was not focussed on the narrow matter of the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i>.  Rather, the Supreme Court provides much
    needed guidance on the rights of plan members generally in relation to the
    termination of a pension fund and the wind up of a pension plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasoning in <i>Buschau</i> makes it clear that the court does not have the authority to compel an employer
    to wind up a pension plan at the request of members of the pension plan because
    to do so would be contrary to:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.  the societal purposes for which pension plans
    exist;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii. the scheme
    of the legislation that governs pension plans; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii. <span
class=GramE>the</span> language usually found in pension plan documentation
    giving the employer the right to terminate the trust and pension plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority decision in the Divisional Court would
    permit the court to order Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to wind up the
    Plan pursuant to s. 68(1) of the <i>PBA</i>.  However, ordering an employer to commence
    wind up proceedings under s. 68(1) of the <i>PBA </i>is tantamount to ordering the wind up of the pension plan.  Because the court cannot do indirectly that
    which it cannot do directly,<a href="#_ftn24"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[24]</span></span></span></a> <i>Buschau </i>makes it “plain and obvious”
    that the court does not have the authority to order an employer to commence
    wind up proceedings under s. 68 of the <i>PBA</i> at the request of plan members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that <i>Buschau </i>stands for the proposition that the rule in <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i> is not available to
    plan members because the rule operates outside the <i>PBA</i>.  On the applicant’s
    view, because the impugned paragraphs ask the court to order Rio <span
class=SpellE>Algom</span> to wind up the Pension Plan by means of s. 68(1) of
    the <i>PBA</i>, the reasoning in <i>Buschau</i> does not apply.  I do not accept this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that <i>Buschau </i>dictates that where a statutory scheme exists for the termination and wind
    up of pension plans, it must be followed.  That statutory process, discussed in detail below, is not to be
    circumvented by the courts.  However,
    that does not mean that the court has the right to require an employer to wind
    up the pension plan by means of compliance with the legislative scheme.  The core reasoning in <i>Buschau</i> is that the members of a pension plan do not have the right
    to compel an employer to wind up the pension plan.  The decision in <i>Buschau </i>is not confined to the method by which wind up is to take
    place.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE SCHEME OF THE <i>PBA</i> PRECLUDES THE COURT FROM ORDERING AN
    EMPLOYER TO COMMENCE WIND UP PROCEEDINGS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before examining the statutory scheme governing the
    wind up of pension plans in Ontario, it is useful to recall certain foundational
    principles underlying the pension legislation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canada has chosen a “voluntary” system of private pension
    plan coverage.  This means that unlike
    some other countries in the world, Canadian employers are not obliged to provide
    pension plans for their employees.  Thus,
    employers have the right to decide both whether to establish pension plans for
    their employees and, subject to anything to the contrary in the pension plan
    documentation, to end any pension plan they might establish.  However, while employers have the right to
    establish and to wind up pension plans, both actions are heavily regulated
    through legislation.  There are many
    reasons for regulating pension plans but one of the most fundamental is the
    need for oversight by an independent regulator to ensure that pension plan
    promises are met and pension funds are not misused.  It is with these principles in mind that I
    turn to a consideration of the statutory framework governing the wind up of
    pension plans.  In this regard, I endorse
    Murray J.’s excellent analysis of the statutory wind up provisions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pension plans provided for people employed in Ontario
    are subject to the provisions of the <i>PBA</i>.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[25]</span></span></span></a>  Together, the <i>PBA </i>and the <i>FSCOA </i>govern
    the wind up of pension plans.  The
    relevant provisions in both pieces of legislation can be found as Schedules “A”
    and “B” to these reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>FSCOA </i>creates
    the administrative structure for certain regulated sectors in Ontario,
    including pension plans.  The three
    principal institutions established by <i>FSCOA </i>are the Financial Services Commission (the “Commission”), the Superintendent
    and the Tribunal.  The role of the
    Superintendent is, among other things, to administer the <i>PBA </i>and supervise generally private pension plans.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[26]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>PBA </i>provides
    only two methods by which a pension plan can be wound up.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the employer’s right to wind up pension plans,
    in whole or in part, is affirmed in s. 68(1) of the <i>PBA</i>.  However, this does not
    mean that the employer’s right to wind up is unfettered.  Wind up of a pension plan can be done only
    through compliance with the <i>PBA</i>.  Section 68(2) makes it mandatory that the
    plan administrator give written notice of the proposal to wind up the pension
    plan to the Superintendent and pension plan members, among others.  Section 70(1) stipulates that the
    administrator of a pension plan that is to be wound up must file a wind up
    report and s. 70(2) provides that no payments can be made out of the pension
    fund after notice of proposal to wind up, until the Superintendent has approved
    the wind up report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the pension fund of a pension plan that is wound up continues
    until all the pension fund assets have been disbursed,<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[27]</span></span></span></a> and as the preceding paragraph makes clear, distribution on wind up is
    dependent on Superintendent approval, the only way the employer can wind up is
    through compliance with the <i>PBA</i>.  The Superintendent’s role in <span
class=GramE>a</span> “s. 68 wind up” is to provide the necessary regulatory oversight
    to ensure that the wind up complies with the requirements of the <i>PBA </i>and regulations and the plan
    documentation.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[28]</span></span></span></a>  The Superintendent cannot force the
    continuation of the pension plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, s. 69(1) gives the Superintendent the discretion
    to order the wind up of a pension plan, in whole or in part, in certain
    specified situations such as the employer’s failure to make required
    contributions to the pension fund, the employer’s bankruptcy, or the cessation
    of employment of a significant number of members of the pension plan as a
    result of the discontinuance of all or part of the employer’s business.  More is said below about the elaborate process
    that must be followed in a Superintendent initiated wind up.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, it is significant to note that the <i>PBA </i>does not give plan members the right
    to compel the wind up of a pension plan.  As the Supreme Court observed in <i>Buschau</i>,
    this does not leave plan members without recourse.  If plan members believe that the employer has
    acted improperly in the administration of the plan, they may turn to the
    Superintendent.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[29]</span></span></span></a>  All of the alleged <span class=GramE>wrongdoing
    set out in the Amended Notice of Application are</span> matters that the Superintendent
    can take into account in determining what steps, if any, should be taken in
    respect of the Pension Plan.  As <i>Buschau </i>directs, when recourse to the
    Superintendent is available to plan members, they should use it.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[30]</span></span></span></a>    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on <i>Buschau</i>,
    the applicant has conceded that the court cannot make an order directly
    compelling Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to wind up the Pension
    Plan.  With respect, there is no
    difference between ordering Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to wind up the
    Pension Plan and the relief contemplated in the impugned paragraphs, namely, ordering
    Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to commence wind up proceedings pursuant to
    s. 68(1) of the <i>PBA</i>.  As will be evident from the foregoing
    explanation of the wind up provisions that apply to employers, there is only
    one way an employer can wind up a pension plan in Ontario and that is pursuant
    to s. 68(1) of the <i>PBA.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the court cannot order Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to wind up the Pension Plan at the request of plan members, it cannot order Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to commence wind up proceedings pursuant to s.
    68(1) at the request of plan members – the two are synonymous.  To suggest that there is a difference between
    the two orders reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the employer
    initiated wind up of a pension plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I return to a consideration of the statutory scheme
    governing the Superintendent’s powers in relation to the wind up of pension
    plans. It offers a separate basis for concluding that the court does not have
    the authority to compel an employer to commence wind up proceedings under the <i>PBA</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When it is the Superintendent (rather than the employer)
    who initiates the wind up of a pension plan, a very different process must be
    followed.  The <i>PBA </i>and the <i>FSCOA</i> create a
    carefully calibrated, multi-layered process for deciding whether a wind up will
    be ordered when the wind up has not been initiated by the employer.  Section 89(5) of the <i>PBA </i>requires the Superintendent to serve notice of the proposal to
    make an order to wind up (the “Notice of Proposal”)<span class=GramE>,</span> together
    with written reasons for why he or she proposes to make the wind up order, on
    the plan administrator and the employer.  The Superintendent is also empowered to require the plan administrator
    to transmit a copy of the Notice of Proposal and reasons to other persons (<span
class=GramE>s.89(</span>5)).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Notice of Proposal must state that the person on
    whom it is served is entitled to a hearing before the Tribunal (s. 89(6)).  If a hearing is not required, the
    Superintendent may carry out the proposal (s. 89(7)).  That is, the Superintendent may wind up the
    pension plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the employer or any other person receiving the
    Notice of Proposal can challenge the proposed wind up order.  This is done by requiring a hearing before
    the Tribunal (ss. 89(6) and (8)).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent, the person requiring the hearing
    and any other persons specified by the Tribunal are the parties to the
    proceeding (s. 89(11)).<a href="#_ftn31"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[31]</span></span></span></a>  The Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to decide
    all questions of fact and law that arise in the proceeding (s. 20 of the <i>FSCOA</i>).  At or after the hearing, the Tribunal has the power to direct the
    Superintendent to carry out or to refrain from carrying out the proposal to
    wind up, and to take such actions as the Tribunal considers the Superintendent
    ought to have taken in the circumstances (s. 89(9)).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever decision the Tribunal makes can be appealed to
    the Divisional Court (s. 91(1)).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the court could simply require the employer to
    commence wind up proceedings under s. 68(1) of the <i>PBA</i> as the Order would permit, the statutory process governing
    Superintendent initiated wind ups would be eliminated.  This appears to me to be an impermissible
    interference with the legislative scheme in two ways.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the court would have to decide the matters of
    fact and law necessary in determining whether a wind up should be ordered.  Those matters involve difficult questions of
    entitlement and calculations of liability for plan members’ pensions, the
    adequacy of the plan assets to satisfy liabilities, prioritization of claims,
    methods of distribution, questions related to grow-in benefits and a host of
    other complex, technical issues.<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[32]</span></span></span></a>  But, the legislature has given the
    Superintendent the power in the first instance to determine whether to initiate
    wind up proceedings and it has given the Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction to
    decide that matter at or after the hearing.<a
href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[33]</span></span></span></a>  If the court were to order Rio <span
class=SpellE>Algom</span> to commence wind up proceedings, it would violate the
    legislative scheme and amount to an unauthorized usurpation of the authority
    delegated to the Superintendent and Tribunal.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the procedural safeguards and appeal rights of all
    affected parties that are established by the statutory process would be
    eliminated.  There would be no
    preliminary determination by the Superintendent that a wind up was necessary
    and appropriate.  There would be no
    hearing by the Tribunal and there would be no appeal to the Divisional
    Court.  Instead, the Ontario Superior Court
    of Justice would make the first instance decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Mahar</i></span><i> v. Rogers <span
class=SpellE>Cablesystems</span> Ltd. </i>(1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 690, at p. 698 (Ont.
    Ct. (Gen. Div.)), Sharpe J. rejected the suggestion that there was overlapping
    jurisdiction between an expert regulatory body and the courts, saying: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]here Parliament has created a statutory regime
    which includes both rights and a procedure for their resolution, there is at
    the very least a strong reluctance to permit jurisdiction to be divided between
    the specialized agency or tribunal and the courts or to permit overlapping or
    concurrent jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those comments apply with force in the pension field,
    where the courts have repeatedly recognized the need for specialised expertise.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[34]</span></span></span></a>  As Robins J.A. said in <span class=SpellE><i>Gencorp</i></span><i> Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Pensions</i>) (1998), 39 O.
    R. (3d) 38 (C.A.), at p. 43, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1998] 2 S.C.R.
    vii, when speaking about the <i>PBA</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The administration and regulation of this
    manifestly complex and specialized field of activity requires specific
    knowledge and expertise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the court would be disadvantaged should
    the statutory process be circumvented because it would be deprived of a cogent
    factual record on which to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the
    arguments for and against termination of the pension plan and distribution of
    the assets.  If the statutory process is
    followed, when the Divisional Court hears an appeal from a decision of the
    Tribunal, it has the benefit of a full record.  The Superintendent and the Tribunal will have fulfilled the different
    roles assigned to them by the legislation in determining whether to order a
    wind up, using their specialised expertise.  If, however, the court could compel the employer to commence wind up
    proceedings without the benefit of the statutory process, the roles of the
    Superintendent and the Tribunal are eliminated and the court is denied the
    benefit of their specialised expertise.  As Murray J. said at para. 52 of his dissenting reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is the departure from the statutory scheme, in
    the manner advanced by the [applicant], that would deprive a reviewing court of
    a cogent record on which to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the
    arguments for and against plan termination or that relate to the distribution
    of plan assets.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The task of deciding when to order an “involuntary”
    wind up<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[36]</span></span></span></a>  If the Order is permitted to stand, the
    courts would become an alternate forum for the determination of that
    matter.  This would disrupt the
    legislative scheme, <span class=SpellE>shortcircuit</span> the statutory
    process and deprive the courts and the litigants of the knowledge and expertise
    brought to the difficult issues that arise when contemplating the involuntary
    wind up of a pension plan.  As Murray J.
    said, at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To deprive a reviewing court of the specialized
    expertise of the regulators on wind up and the subsequent distribution of
    assets reflects neither the intention of the legislature nor the interests of
    the employer, plan members or others with an interest in the pension plan. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impugned paragraphs contemplate the court making an
    order requiring Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to commence wind up
    proceedings pursuant to s. 68 of the <i>PBA</i>.  A majority of the Divisional Court would
    permit the impugned paragraphs to remain because, in their view, it is not
    plain and obvious that such an order is unavailable as a mandatory injunction
    to protect the applicant plan member’s rights or as one of the court’s array of <span class=SpellE>restitutionary</span> remedies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A restorative mandatory injunction requires the
    defendant to repair a situation in a manner consistent with the plaintiff’s rights.  It is available only to protect an existing
    right.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span

'>[37]</span></span></span></a>  Both the reasoning in <i>Buschau </i>and the legislative scheme governing the wind up of pension
    plans lead to the conclusion that the applicant, as a member of the Pension
    Plan, does not have the right to compel its wind up.  As he has no such right, a mandatory
    injunction to that effect is not available.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does the court have the authority to order the
    employer to commence wind up proceedings as part of its powers to effect
    restitution.  Together, the <i>PBA</i> and the <i>FSCOA</i> create a comprehensive statutory regime regarding the wind up
    of pension plans.  Under that scheme, the
    court has no original jurisdiction to order the wind up of a pension plan.  There is no difference between an order
    requiring an employer to wind up a pension plan and an order requiring an
    employer to commence wind up proceedings under the <i>PBA</i>.  As there is no power in
    the court to order the former, there is no power in the court to order the
    latter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it is “plain and obvious” that the court
    does not have the authority to order Rio <span class=SpellE>Algom</span> to
    commence wind up proceedings under the <i>PBA</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foregoing is sufficient to dispose of this
    appeal.  Nonetheless, a brief comment is
    warranted in respect of the suggestion in the reasons of the majority in the
    Divisional Court, that the court has the power to terminate a pension trust
    pursuant to trust law principles.  <span
lang=EN-US>I question that suggestion for two
    reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first relates to the fact that a pension trust is

class=SpellE>Gaydon</span></i>, the plaintiff became the trustee of the Crane
    Trust as a result of a court order removing Ms. Crane as trustee. Following Ms.
    Crane’s mingling of trust accounts and mismanagement of the trust assets, the
    plaintiff had been unable to reconstruct the accounts of the Crane Trust. The trust
    beneficiaries had attained the age of majority and were of sound mind.  The plaintiff sought an order removing himself
    as trustee and dissolving the trust.  The
    court rejected the notion that it could order the trust to be dissolved. </p>

    Court may, by order, dissolve a trust in the same way as it may, for example,
    dissolve a partnership…. Any such assumption is, of course, unwarranted.  <i>It is
    the duty of the Court to uphold and protect trusts, not to destroy them,</i> although where the terms of the trust envisage, in certain circumstances, <span
class=SpellE>realisation</span> of property, winding up of the trust’s affairs
    and final payments to beneficiaries, the Court will, naturally enough, give

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Thinking

    growing assimilation of certain kinds of trusts to companies.  I refer, of course, to trusts governed by the

    schemes.  Part 5C.9 of the Corporations
    Law allows managed investment schemes to be wound up in various circumstances
    and creates certain powers which may be exercised by the Court in relation to
    such a winding up.  But those provisions
    are irrelevant here.  I mention them only
