  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant, </span>C.R., was convicted of two counts of sexual assault against
    his former girlfriend, J.P.  He was
    sentenced to two and one-half years imprisonment on each count, to be served
    concurrently.  He appeals against both
    conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R.’s trial before a judge sitting without a jury was
    a straightforward ‘he said – she said’ case.  C.R. and J.P. were the only witnesses.  Credibility, therefore, was the central issue.  It was the defence position that J.P.
    fabricated her sexual assault allegations to exact revenge against C.R. for his
    alleged ill-treatment of her during their relationship and because, over J.P.’s
    objections, C.R. became intimately involved with J.P.’s younger sister after
    his relationship with J.P. ended.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his conviction appeal, C.R. argues that
    the trial judge erred by misapprehending important aspects of J.P.’s evidence, by
    minimizing significant inconsistencies in her testimony and, generally, by subjecting
    C.R.’s and J.P.’s evidence to an imbalanced level of scrutiny.  On his sentence appeal, C.R. seeks to set
    aside his custodial sentence, on various grounds, and to substitute therefor a conditional
    sentence of nine to twelve months in respect of each offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the
    conviction and the sentence appeals.</p>

    Relationship</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. and J.P. are both cycling enthusiasts.  At the relevant times, they also shared
    interests in photography and music.  They
    met in the spring of 2003 at a cycling shop where C.R. was a regular customer
    and J.P. was a part-time employee.  C.R.
    was then a 37-year old divorced man.  J.P.
    was a 16 or 17-year old high school student.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For several months, C.R. and J.P. engaged in friendly
    and, eventually, mutually flirtatious discussions during their encounters at
    the cycling shop.  In approximately
    August of 2003, J.P. volunteered to assist C.R. at a photo shoot.  They began to date shortly thereafter and
    almost immediately became involved in a sexually intimate relationship.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their relationship lasted for about 18 months.  It ended in April of 2005 when J.P. broke-up
    with C.R. following her 19th birthday.  By that time, J.P. was interested in another
    man.  Nonetheless, at C.R.’s request, J.P.
    agreed to remain friends with C.R. and to go cycling with him on a bi-weekly
    basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While they were dating, C.R. and J.P. engaged
    frequently in consensual sexual activities at C.R.’s home.  However, throughout her relationship with
    C.R., J.P. suffered from irritable bowel syndrome with ulcerative colitis,
    which caused her pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding.  On the trial judge’s findings, J.P. told C.R.
    of her condition and made it clear to him that she could not participate in
    anal intercourse although C.R. was interested in doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. and J.P. also socialized with mutual friends,
    dined at C.R.’s house, attended concerts and cycled together.  J.P. met various members of C.R.’s family.  Over time, she began to spend several nights
    a week at C.R.’s house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.P. claimed, however, that C.R. insisted that the
    intimate nature of their relation-ship remain secret.  She explained that after they had been seeing
    each other for about one month, and after they had already engaged in sexual
    intercourse, she told C.R. that she was 17 years old.  She said that C.R. was upset to learn this
    and made some comment that her age “made him a pedophile”.  After learning her real age, he insisted that
    their relationship be kept secret because he thought that it was illegal for
    him to have sex with J.P. before she was 18 years of age, and “he would go to
    jail” for having done so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, C.R. maintained that when he met J.P., he
    thought she was 19 or 20 years old.  He
    said that she did not tell him of her actual age until the late winter or early
    spring of 2004, several months after their sexual relationship was underway.  He was surprised and upset to learn of her age,
    as he was uncertain of the legality of their sexual relations.  He did not recall saying anything to J.P.
    about this concern or about “being a pedophile”.  Rather, he told her that he would have to
    think about whether their relationship could continue.  After he conducted research on the Internet
    and concluded that the legal age of consent for sexual relations was 14 years,
    he informed J.P. that he wished to carry on with their relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. denied that he tried to hide the intimate nature
    of his relationship with J.P.  He claimed
    that J.P. told him that “it wouldn’t be good for [her father] to know that we
    were together” and that her father, a policeman, was known to have a temper.  C.R. therefore agreed with J.P. that her parents
    should not find out that their relationship was sexual.  C.R. maintained that this agreement was
    unrelated to his concern about the legality of his sexual relations with
    J.P.  He acknowledged that he introduced
    J.P. to his own parents and others as “my friend”, explaining that he avoided
    calling J.P. his “girlfriend” as he disliked the terms “girlfriend, boyfriend”.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       J.P.’s Sexual Assault Allegations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.P. alleged that C.R. sexually assaulted her on two
    occasions.  The first incident took place
    in December of 2003.  According to J.P., while
    she and C.R. were engaged in consensual vaginal intercourse, C.R. suddenly and
    without warning initiated anal intercourse.  Notwithstanding her attempt to move away from him and her repeated protestations
    that she “couldn’t do it”, C.R. persisted and continued to thrust his penis
    into her anus (the “First Assault”).  Although
    her testimony as to timing varied, J.P. ultimately testified at trial that C.R.
    stopped what he was doing within “a couple of seconds” of her request that he
    do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.P. further alleged that in August of 2005, about four
    months after she had broken up with him, C.R. again sexually assaulted her by
    engaging in forced vaginal intercourse with her at his house after the couple
    had finished a lengthy bike ride (the “Second Assault”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On J.P.’s account, this particular bike ride started
    and ended later than usual.  When it
    became apparent that J.P. would not be able to bike home before dark, C.R.
    offered to drive her home.  They went to
    C.R.’s nearby house to retrieve his car.  However, on arrival, C.R. delayed the ride by having a shower and
    something to eat.  J.P. also decided to
    shower in a separate bathroom near a spare bedroom.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.P. maintained that while she was in the bathroom, C.R.
    positioned himself outside the door and attempted to engage her in
    conversation.  J.P. asked C.R. to leave
    so that she could exit the bathroom and obtain her clothes.  C.R. refused and impeded her exit.  J.P. eventually pushed past C.R. and went
    into the bedroom, wearing only a towel.  C.R. followed her and pushed her onto the bed from behind, using his
    body weight.  Despite resistance and
    objections from J.P., C.R. then lifted her towel and forced his penis into her
    vagina.  The penetration was brief,
    lasting only a few seconds.  It ended
    when J.P. became upset and started to cry.  C.R. told J.P. that she really wanted to have sex with him.  Shortly thereafter, J.P. telephoned her
    father to come and pick her up.  When her
    father arrived, J.P. left with him, having little or no further discussion with
    C.R.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       C.R.’s Response</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. denied any sexually assaultive conduct against J.P.
    and asserted that she had fabricated her sexual assault allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the First Assault, C.R. testified that
    he was inexperienced with anal intercourse.  He said that he and J.P. discussed “trying anal intercourse”, that J.P.
    wished to try it as “it was something new for both of us” and, notwithstanding
    her medical condition, J.P. felt that she could try to participate in anal
    intercourse with the use of lubricants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. claimed that he and J.P. engaged in anal
    intercourse only once, on a consensual basis and using lubricants, after they
    had been dating for almost one year.  He
    said that the activity lasted about five minutes and ended prior to ejaculation.  According to C.R., the couple later discussed
    having anal intercourse again and, as “it wasn’t anything fabulous”, they “just
    never did it again”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. also denied the Second Assault.  He acknowledged that he had gone for a bike
    ride with J.P. on the day in question and that they had returned to his house
    so that he could drive her home.  He also
    confirmed that they took separate showers at his house and that he stood
    outside the bathroom door where J.P. was showering, attempting to engage her in
    conversation.  However, he adamantly
    denied that any sexual activity – consensual or otherwise – took place.  He said that when J.P. asked him to leave so
    that she could dress, he did so.  He
    professed to not understand why J.P. was curt with him thereafter, or why she
    called her father for a ride home.  On
    C.R.’s version of events, J.P. simply became annoyed and frustrated with his
    delay in driving her home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The day of the Second Assault marked the end of any
    type of relationship between C.R. and J.P.  Apart from brief arrangements for J.P.’s return to C.R. of certain of
    his property and some angry calls from J.P. to C.R. when she learned of his
    interactions with her sister, C.R. and J.P. had no further contact.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       The Trial Judge’s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, J.P. and C.R. provided differing descriptions
    of many aspects of their relationship, of the First and Second Assaults, and of
    the events following their last bike ride together.  In these circumstances, the trial judge
    recognized that she was required to approach this case in accordance with the
    principles outlined in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  She properly directed
    herself as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, if I believe the evidence of the accused I
    must acquit.  Second, if I do not believe
    the testimony of the accused but I am left in reasonable doubt by it, I must
    acquit.  Third, even if I am not left in
    doubt by the evidence of the accused, I must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt on the basis of the evidence which I do accept, of the guilt of the
    accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her analysis of the evidence, the trial judge dealt
    first with C.R.’s testimony.  She
    concluded, in effect, that his testimony was internally inconsistent, and that it
    “defie[d] common sense” and “[made] no sense” in several respects.  Citing particular examples, the trial judge
    further observed that C.R. was “reluctant to concede even the smallest point”
    on cross-examination.  Based on these
    considerations, she concluded as follows with respect to the first and second
    steps of the <i>W.(D.)</i> test:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Taking all of these factors into account, I do not
    believe [C.R.’s] evidence with respect to the incident of anal intercourse [the
    First Assault] and I do not believe his account of the events at his house
    following the last bike ride [the Second Assault].  I have further considered his evidence as it
    pertains to reasonable doubt and I conclude that his evidence does not leave me
    with a reasonable doubt with respect to either of those events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the third step of <i>W.(D.)</i>, the trial judge then turned to
    J.P.’s evidence to determine whether the Crown had proved its case beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  She reviewed J.P.’s
    testimony about the First and Second Assaults, the defence attacks on her
    credibility, and what the trial judge called incidents of admitted “dishonest
    behaviour” by J.P.  In the end, she found
    J.P.’s version of the First and Second Assaults credible and reliable,
    reasoning in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the whole, I found J.P.’s accounts of the two
    events to be internally plausible.  Her
    description of the events was such that it gave credit to [C.R.] for
    withdrawing soon after he appeared to recognize how much he was hurting
    her.  She did not appear to exaggerate
    her evidence to portray [C.R.] in a bad light nor did she appear to minimize
    her own dishonest behaviour.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two issues on the conviction appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in her assessment of J.P.’s
    credibility by misapprehending certain aspects of her evidence and by
    minimizing significant inconsistencies in her testimony?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by subjecting C.R.’s evidence
    to a stricter standard of scrutiny than that applied to J.P.’s testimony?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three issues on the sentence appeal: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by characterizing the Second
    Assault as a breach of trust?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by treating the First and
    Second Assaults as equally serious in nature, leading to the imposition of
    equivalent sentences of imprisonment? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by imposing sentences that are
    excessive in the circumstances?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.      Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>            (1)       Assessment of J.P.’s Credibility</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is no suggestion that the trial
    judge failed to understand the multi-faceted defence challenge to J.P.’s
    credibility.  Such a complaint would
    founder in the face of the trial judge’s relatively detailed reasons and
    numerous references to the specifics of C.R.’s attack on J.P.’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, C.R. argues that the trial judge erred in her
    assessment of J.P.’s credibility by misapprehending, and discounting the
    inconsistencies in, J.P.’s testimony of: (i) whether she and C.R. participated
    in anal intercourse after the First Assault; (ii) her discussions with C.R.
    about anal intercourse; and (iii) her disclosure of the Second Assault to her
    mother.  C.R. submits that these errors were
    central to the trial judge’s determination whether she believed J.P. under the
    third step of the <i>W. (D.)</i> analysis.  I would reject this argument for the
    following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, I observe that an appellant faces an
    up-hill battle to succeed on appeal with a misapprehension of evidence
    argument.  A material misapprehension of
    the evidence by a trial judge compromises trial fairness, thereby justifying appellate
    inter-vention.  However, a stringent standard
    applies to appellate reversal on this basis.  In <i>R. v. C.L.Y.</i>, [2008] 1
    S.C.R. 5, at para. 19, and in <i>R. v.
    Lohrer</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at para. 1, the Supreme Court cited with
    approval the applicable test formulated by Doherty J.A. of this court in <i>R. v. Morrissey </i>(1995), 22 O.R. (3d)
    514, at p. 541: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Where a trial
    judge is mistaken as to the substance of material parts of the evidence and
    those errors play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a
    conviction, then, in my view, the accused’s conviction is not based exclusively
    on the evidence and is not a “true” verdict</i>. … If an appellant can
    demonstrate that the conviction depends on a misapprehension of the evidence
    then, in my view, it must follow that the appellant has not received a fair
    trial, and was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.  This is so even if the evidence, as actually
    adduced at trial, was capable of supporting a conviction.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>See also <i>R. v. H.C.</i>,
    2009 ONCA 56, at para. 51 and <i>R. v. T.T.</i>,
    2009 ONCA 613, at para. 33.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, to warrant appellate interference, the
    misapprehension at issue “must be material rather than peripheral to the
    reasoning of the trial judge”.  In
    addition, the error identified “must play an essential part not just in the
    narrative of the judgment but ‘in the reasoning process resulting in a
    conviction’”: <i>Lohrer</i>, at para. 2; <i>C.L.Y.</i>, at para. 19.  A mere misstatement or inaccuracy in the
    trial judge’s treatment of the evidence does not constitute a reversible error: <i>T.T.</i>, at para. 33. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, credibility is a question of fact.  On factual matters, it is a reviewing court’s
    responsibility to afford due deference to the advantageous position of the
    trial judge who actually saw and heard the witnesses: <i>R. v. Cresswell</i>, 2009 ONCA 95, at para. 14; <i>R. v. J.H.</i> (2005), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 46. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The analysis of the trial judge’s decision in this case
    must be guided by these two controlling principles.  Against this backdrop, I will deal with each
    of the errors alleged by C.R.</p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)
           Evidence of Instances   </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>                                    of
    Anal Intercourse</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no error in the trial judge’s appreciation of J.P.’s
    trial testimony concerning whether she and C.R. attempted or engaged in anal
    intercourse after the First Assault.  When
    this question was posed to her at C.R.’s preliminary inquiry, J.P. replied: “I
    don’t recall.”  On cross-examination at
    trial, she acknowledged her preliminary inquiry testimony but said that she used
    the wrong word when she said “recall”.  She stated that a second incident of anal intercourse with C.R. is
    something that she would remember and that it did not occur.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. submits that this was a significant inconsistency
    in J.P.’s testimony on an essential issue.  He argues that, apart from simply reciting J.P.’s relevant evidence, the
    trial judge failed to come to grips with the inconsistency or to provide a
    reasoned explanation for its lack of import.  He characterizes this as a “misapprehension” of the evidence by the
    trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  It
    was open to the trial judge to accept J.P.’s explanation that she misspoke at
    the preliminary inquiry when she said that she did not “recall” whether another
    incident of anal intercourse occurred.  The
    trial judge’s reasons are open to the conclusion that by identifying the
    inconsistency between J.P.’s preliminary inquiry testimony and her evidence at
    trial on this issue, and by recounting J.P.’s explanation for it, the trial
    judge was satisfied with J.P.’s explanation.  Once J.P.’s explanation for the inconsistency was accepted by the trial
    judge, it lost its power to raise a reasonable doubt regarding C.R.’s guilt:
    see <i>R. v. François</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R.
    827, at p. 839.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that C.R. and J.P. both testified that only one
    incident of anal intercourse occurred.  They simply disputed the nature of that sexual encounter and the events
    surrounding it.  The essential issue at
    trial was not whether the couple experimented with anal intercourse on more
    than one occasion (a proposition that even C.R. did not advance).  Rather, the core issue was whether events of forced
    intercourse occurred in the manner and at the times alleged by J.P. </p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       Evidence of Discussion </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>                                    Regarding
    the First Assault</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also reject C.R.’s challenge to the trial
    judge’s treatment of J.P.’s evidence on the issue whether C.R. and J.P. discussed
    the First Assault after it occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. stresses that during her examination-in-chief at
    trial, J.P. said that no such discussion took place.  He maintains that this assertion was
    inconsistent with J.P.’s depiction of him as someone who was preoccupied,
    indeed “fixated”, on anal intercourse.  It also conflicted, he says, with J.P.’s preliminary inquiry evidence
    that the couple had “definitely talked about anal sex quite a bit”, on
    “multiple” occasions and, finally, with a notation contained in a police
    officer’s notes, which apparently attributed to J.P. the following statement: “He
    made it out to be an accident.”  C.R.
    argues that the trial judge erred by misapprehending, and minimizing the
    inconsistency in, this “fluctuating” evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument rests on the premise that J.P.’s evidence
    about an after-the-fact discussion with C.R. regarding the First Assault was in
    fact inconsistent and that the trial judge failed to appreciate or reconcile
    this inconsistency.  In my view, this contention
    ignores the distinction in J.P.’s evidence between general discussions about
    anal sex and an incident-specific conversation with C.R. concerning the First
    Assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that, at trial, J.P. testified during her
    examination-in-chief that she did not discuss the First Assault with C.R. on
    the night that it occurred or thereafter.  Later in her evidence, she said that she had no recall of such a
    discussion.  However, she also indicated
    that she and C.R. had many discussions about anal intercourse.  During cross-examination, J.P. provided the
    following evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        You
    don’t recall ever after [the First Assault], ever talking to [C.R.] about it?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        There
    are lots of things that I tried to forget, actually, because it is a very
    painful subject matter for me.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay,
    and that’s not my question.  My question
    is is it your evidence that you don’t recall ever speaking to [C.R.] about this
    incident after it happened?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>He tried to convince me to have anal
    intercourse again so we did talk about anal intercourse I guess again.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Sorry,
    are you saying you talked about having anal intercourse after this incident?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        He
    wanted to.  He, it was something that he
    was very fixated on.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        If
    that is true I assume if he wanted to try it again that there would have been
    discussion about the fact that according to you it did not go very well the
    first time?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        It
    did not go well the first time, no.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        But
    if what you are saying is true that after this incident there was talk about
    trying to have anal intercourse again I am going to suggest it would be natural
    for the two of you to talk about the first time and how it didn’t go well for
    you, does that make sense?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I
    remember it, I, when I talk about, when I try to remember, I remember being in
    pain for a good week after that incident and trying not to let him know that I
    was in so much pain because it was embarrassing to me.  <i>I don’t
    recall any exact conversations or comments that were made</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>After this incident did you or did you not

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, J.P. acknowledged having discussions with C.R. regarding
    anal intercourse, after the First Assault.  Her testimony remained consistent, however, that she did not remember
    discussing the First Assault itself with him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.P.’s evidence at the preliminary inquiry was to the
    same effect.  Although C.R. relies on
    several passages from J.P.’s preliminary inquiry testimony in which she said
    that she and C.R. discussed anal sex “quite a bit” and “multiple times”, this
    evidence again concerned general discussions with C.R. about anal sex.  C.R. failed to point to any excerpt from
    J.P.’s preliminary inquiry testimony in which she stated that she and C.R.
    discussed the First Assault after-the-fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reach a similar conclusion concerning the suggested
    inconsistency between J.P.’s trial testimony on this issue and the statement
    attributed to her to the effect that, “He made it out to be an accident.”  This statement is recorded in notes prepared by
    a police officer – Sergeant Verrier – at a meeting held with J.P. in
    preparation for the preliminary inquiry. The notes were in point – rather than
    verbatim – form.  At trial, the defence
    relied on this statement to argue that it was inconsistent with J.P.’s claim
    that she did not discuss the First Assault with C.R. after-the-fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sergeant Verrier’s meeting notes were not shown to J.P.
    prior to trial.  Moreover, J.P. did not
    adopt the contents of the meeting notes at any time, although she also did not dispute
    their accuracy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Sergeant Verrier’s meeting notes were put to her
    on cross-examination at trial, J.P. indicated, on three separate occasions,
    that she did not remember making the statement at issue.  She then reiterated her earlier testimony that
    “I really don’t remember talking about it [the First Assault] afterwards.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following exchange with defence counsel then
    occurred:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay,
    but apart from what you remember or don’t remember saying to Sergeant Verrier,
    going back to this incident you are saying took place, was there anything said
    or done by [C.R.] wherein he made it out to be an accident?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I do
    not remember that happening.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>So in your evidence you can’t help us at all
    understand the comment – if you made it – “He made it out to be an accident</i>”?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>I may have been referring to what he said
    after, like maybe a day or two days after, but I don’t remember talking about
    it afterwards since it has been so long</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In answering these questions, J.P. did not resile from her
    earlier testimony that she did not remember making the statement in
    question.  In the exchange quoted above, the
    last question put to J.P. assumed that she had made the statement.  In her response to this question, J.P.
    reiterated that she did not remember any after-the-fact discussion with C.R.
    concerning the First Assault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, and contrary to C.R.’s submission, the
    trial judge was mindful of the defence claim that J.P.’s evidence, generally,
    and her testimony regarding the First Assault, in particular, were replete with
    inconsistencies.  When reviewing J.P.’s evidence,
    the trial judge cited many of these alleged evidential deficiencies in a
    section of her reasons entitled “Inconsistencies”.  While she did not explicitly refer to each of
    the inconsistencies asserted by the defence, she was not obliged to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, there is nothing in the trial judge’s
    reasons indicating that she erred in her appreciation of J.P.’s evidence
    regarding the First Assault, including her evidence about an after-the-fact
    discussion with C.R. about this incident, in a manner that could have affected
    the outcome.  For example, the trial
    judge tackled ‘head-on’ the defence claim that J.P.’s testimony was at odds
    with the contents of Sergeant Verrier’s meeting notes, stating: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[81]     It
    was put to J.P. that in the notes in respect to the incident involving anal
    intercourse, Sgt. Verrier noted that J.P. had said “I wasn’t yelling out no,
    stop.”  J.P. responded “I’m a quiet
    person.  I did not yell”.  This is not inconsistent with J.P.’s
    testimony on the incident, wherein she said that she had told [C.R.] that she
    could not do it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[82]     It
    was put to J.P. that in the notes, following a description of the anal
    intercourse incident, it was noted by Sgt. Verrier “nothing said by either of
    us”.  J.P. responded that she had not
    seen the notes.  She maintained that the
    incident had occurred as she had described it at trial, with her telling [C.R.]
    “I can’t do this” and he replying with something like “Oh, come on”.  A plain reading of the note as it was put to
    the witness in cross-examination leaves open the possibility that the note
    referred to the fact that J.P. and [C.R.] did not discuss the anal intercourse
    incident afterwards.  This is consistent
    with J.P.’s evidence that she was too embarrassed to speak to him about it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[83]     It
    was put to J.P. that Sgt. Verrier noted “he made it out to be an accident, it
    was a sneaky, selfish thing to do.”  J.P.
    testified that she did not recall saying those things but that she “trusted”
    Sgt. Verrier’s notes.  She agreed that
    there was nothing said or done by [C.R.] after the incident which would support
    the statement that he made it out to be an accident.  [C.R.] argues that J.P.’s attempt to resile
    from the statement is evidence of a calculated attempt to deprive [C.R.] of a
    potential defence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[84]     While
    it is troubling that J.P. did not recall saying those things to Sgt. Verrier,
    J.P.’s testimony about the anal intercourse incident did not at any time appear
    to be exaggerated or coloured in order to paint [C.R.] in a bad light.  Although it is difficult to precisely
    characterize it when she testified that she had no memory of saying it, her
    comment to Sgt. Verrier that “he made it out to be an accident” may well have
    been a description of the act itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge thus clearly understood the alleged
    inconsistencies between J.P.’s trial testimony and the contents of Sergeant
    Verrier’s meeting notes and explained her assessment of them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. attacks, especially, the trial judge’s indication that
    the statement “He made it out to be an accident”, “may well have been a
    description of the act itself”.  In my
    view, this was not an unreasonable observation.  The statement apparently attributed to J.P. in Sergeant Verrier’s meeting
    notes is ambiguous.  It is capable of
    being understood as J.P.’s own after-the-fact view of C.R.’s conduct in
    relation to the First Assault, as distinct from a description by J.P. of C.R.’s
    response in a specific discussion about the First Assault.  I note that Sergeant Verrier’s meeting notes
    do not appear to tie the suggested conduct by C.R. to a specific time period.  As a result, it is unclear whether the
    statement reflected J.P.’s own interpretation of C.R.’s conduct at the time of
    the First Assault, whether it referenced actual conduct by C.R. when the First
    Assault occurred or, whether it dealt with an attempt by C.R. to explain away
    the First Assault in a subsequent discussion with J.P.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the exact meaning of the statement recorded
    in Sergeant Verrier’s meeting notes is of little moment.  What is important is that the statement,
    which was never adopted by J.P., is reasonably capable of several
    interpretations – only one of which could be viewed as contradicting the
    suggestion that J.P. and C.R. had no post-event discussion about the First
    Assault.  The trial judge grasped the
    significance of the alleged inconsistency.  Moreover, as she observed, a second notation in Sergeant Verrier’s meeting
    notes read: “nothing said by either of us”.  This appeared to corroborate J.P.’s claim that she and C.R. did not
    discuss the First Assault after-the-fact.  </p>

    J.P.’s Mother</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, </span>C.R. also contends that the trial judge erred by failing to consider
    alleged inconsistencies in J.P.’s evidence of whether she disclosed the Second
    Assault to her mother.  Again, I
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During her examinations-in-chief at C.R.’s preliminary
    inquiry and at trial, J.P. testified that she first disclosed C.R.’s assaultive
    conduct, in general terms, to her father sometime prior to April 2006.  She also testified that she thereafter disclosed
    the <i>details</i> of C.R.’s conduct in a
    videotaped statement that she provided to Sergeant Verrier.  Under cross-examination at the preliminary
    inquiry, J.P. also said that she told her mother during an “awkward car ride
    conversation” that C.R. had “raped” her.  However, J.P. did not refer to this disclosure to her mother in her
    videotaped police statement.  Further,
    the claim of this disclosure only emerged at trial, as it did during the
    preliminary inquiry, on cross-examination.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. argues that J.P.’s failure to remember, during her
    examination-in-chief at trial, that she had testified at the preliminary
    inquiry about such disclosure to her mother was a significant factor to be
    taken into account when assessing her credibility.  He complains that the trial judge
    misapprehended, and failed to consider the inconsistency in, J.P.’s evidence on
    this issue, thereby leading to a flawed assessment of J.P.’s credibility.  He further complains that the trial judge
    misapprehended and failed to consider two other material aspects of J.P.’s
    testimony about the disclosure to her mother, namely: (i) J.P.’s evidence about
    the timing of that disclosure; and (ii) her claim at trial that she did not
    recall the nature of her mother’s response to the disclosure.  In my opinion, each of these complaints is belied
    by the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to C.R.’s submission that the trial judge
    failed to consider the defence attack on J.P.’s evidence about the disclosure to
    her mother, the trial judge’s reasons reveal that she was alive to the defence
    position that J.P. fabricated this disclosure claim in order to bolster her
    credibility.  The trial judge put it this
    way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[91]     [C.R.]
    argues that J.P.’s account of telling her mother that [C.R.] had raped her
    makes no sense and was a deliberate fabrication at the preliminary hearing in
    response to the suggestion that she had told no one of being sexually assaulted
    before Sgt. Verrier.  [C.R.] argues that
    J.P.’s defence of this account is patently absurd and should cause the court
    great concern as to J.P.’s veracity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her reasons, the trial judge specifically noted that,
    in her initial statement to Sergeant Verrier, J.P. did not mention this disclosure.  The trial judge also noted that J.P.’s
    account of this disclosure emerged only on cross-examination at the preliminary
    inquiry and at trial.  She commented: “In
    examination-in-chief at trial, J.P. described the conversation with her mother
    in response to being asked about when she had learned of her sister’s
    relationship with [C.R.].  She did not
    mention telling her mother that [C.R.] had raped her.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the reasons indicate that the trial judge
    understood the timing of J.P.’s evidence of her disclosure to her mother,
    including the sequence in which J.P. testified as to that disclosure, both at
    the preliminary inquiry and at trial.  Moreover, in an exchange with Crown counsel during closing submissions,
    the trial judge focused in part on this precise issue by requesting Crown
    counsel for her submissions on the fact that in “a detailed description of
    [her] conversation [with her mother] to Sergeant Verrier”, J.P. failed to
    mention that she had disclosed the “rape” to her mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons also reveal that the trial judge was alive
    to J.P.’s evidence that she could not recall her mother’s response to this disclosure.  After noting this evidence, the trial judge
    went on to observe: “J.P. testified that her mother just dropped the
    subject.  J.P. explained that her mother
    is uncomfortable talking about anything like that and further J.P. was not at
    that point ready to talk about it.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in my view, there can be no doubt that the
    trial judge appreciated the nature and implications of the inconsistencies
    alleged by the defence concerning J.P.’s account of her disclosure to her
    mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also inaccurate to contend, as C.R. does, that
    the trial judge failed “to come to grips” with this issue in her evaluation of
    J.P.’s credibility.  As she did with many
    other aspects of the defence attack on J.P.’s credibility, the trial judge
    expressly addressed the matter, including the defence assertion that Crown
    counsel specifically asked J.P. about this disclosure at trial.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[92]     I note
    that J.P.’s description of the conversation to Sgt. Verrier was directed at
    explaining how she found out that her sister was involved with [C.R.].  <i>Similarly
    in examination-in-chief at trial, J.P. described the conversation with her
    mother in response to being asked about when she had learned of her sister’s
    relationship with [C.R.].</i>  I do not
    find it sinister that J.P. did not mention telling her mother she had been
    raped until defence counsel specifically asked her at the preliminary hearing
    “did you disclose to anyone else that [C.R.] had, according to you, sexually
    assaulted you?” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that neither in her interview
    with Sergeant Verrier, nor in her examinations-in-chief at the preliminary
    inquiry and at trial, was J.P. specifically asked whether she had disclosed the
    Second Assault to her mother.  The trial
    judge accepted, as Crown counsel at trial urged her to do, that when confronted
    with a direct question, J.P. testified that she did make this disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This interpretation of J.P.’s testimony is consistent
    with the record.  It was therefore open
    to the trial judge to conclude, as she did, that there was nothing “sinister”,
    that is, untoward or suspect, in J.P.’s failure to mention, at an earlier point
    in her testimony, an event about which she had not been directly asked.</p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iv)
         Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, I do not accept C.R.’s argument that the
    trial judge erred by misapprehending key aspects of J.P.’s evidence or by
    minimizing significant inconsistencies in her testimony.  The trial judge reviewed J.P.’s evidence in
    detail.  She did not overlook but,
    rather, went to considerable lengths to identify and address the frailties in her
    evidence, including the defence claims of inconsistencies and contra-dictions
    in her testimony.  She also considered
    J.P.’s demeanour and candour when testifying, an advantage that is unavailable
    to this court.  In effect, C.R. asks this
    court to re-try this case.  That is not
    the function of an appellate court.  I would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Uneven Scrutiny of the Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R.’s second ground of appeal is related to his first
    ground.  He argues that the trial judge
    treated his evidence “differently, and less favourably, than [J.P.’s] evidence
    on similar points”.  He submits that the
    trial judge was overly critical of his evidence, while failing to appreciate or
    take proper account of significant difficulties with J.P.’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Crown
    accepts that it is an error of law for a trial judge to apply a stricter
    standard of scrutiny to the evidence of an accused than that used to assess the
    evidence of Crown witnesses: see <i>R. v.
    T.T.,</i> at paras. 28 and 31; <i>R. v. Owen </i>(2001), 150 O.A.C. 378, at para. 3; and <i>R.
    v. Gostick</i> (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 13-14.  Further, both parties agree that an onerous
    standard must be met by an appellant when advancing this ground of appeal.  In <i>R.
    v. J.H.</i>, at para. 59, Doherty J.A. of this court described this standard in
    this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is a difficult argument to make successfully.
    … To succeed in this kind of argument, the appellant must point to something in
    the reasons of the trial judge or perhaps elsewhere in the record <i>that make it clear</i> that the trial judge
    had applied different standards in assessing the evidence of the appellant and
    the complainant.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After earnest consideration and careful review of the
    record, I have concluded that this ground of appeal cannot succeed in this
    case.  To begin, I am unable to accede to
    C.R.’s claim that the trial judge “paid short shrift to the [defence] arguments
    related to [J.P.’s] inconsistencies and reviewed the evidence fairly
    summarily”.  Nor do I agree with his submission
    that the trial judge failed to rigorously examine numerous inconsistencies and
    “shifting answers” in J.P.’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons are 37 pages in length.  After reviewing some of the background to
    C.R. and J.P.’s relationship and the legal principles governing her assessment
    of their credibility, the trial judge turned to C.R.’s evidence.  Her review of his testimony comprises 11 and
    one-half pages of her reasons.  It
    focuses on the salient features of C.R.’s evidence about the nature of his
    relationship with J.P., the First and Second Assaults and the events that
    followed the cessation of any contact between C.R. and J.P.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge devoted similar attention to J.P.’s
    testimony.  Seventeen pages of her
    reasons concern her evaluation of J.P.’s evidence.  In 12 pages, the trial judge details her
    consideration of several factors that bore directly on J.P.’s credibility, as
    advanced by the defence.  These included:
    (i) the timing of J.P.’s disclosure of C.R.’s assaultive conduct to the police;
    (ii) J.P.’s alleged motive for fabricating her allegations; (iii) the evidence
    of dishonest conduct by J.P.; (iv) numerous inconsistencies in J.P.’s evidence
    that the defence alleged undermined her credibility; and (v) the lack of confirmatory
    evidence supporting J.P.’s version of events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course, I do not suggest that the length of the
    trial judge’s reasons assures the even-handedness of the judicial analysis that
    underlies them.  But in this case, given
    the length and content of her reasons, it can scarcely be said that the trial
    judge’s review of the evidence was inadequate or that she failed to grasp and
    deal with the defence challenge to J.P.’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At its core, C.R.’s complaint is that the trial judge
    disbelieved him and rejected his testimony on many issues that C.R. views as
    minor or peripheral to the central issue in the case, namely, whether he
    sexually assaulted J.P. in the manner and at the times alleged.  In contrast, C.R. argues, the trial judge too
    readily cast aside or discounted the difficulties in J.P.’s evidence.  I do not accept this characterization of the
    trial judge’s reasons.  I turn first to
    her consideration of C.R.’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that several of the inconsistencies in
    C.R.’s evidence cited by the trial judge appear to be minor in nature or
    related to peripheral matters.  But the
    assessment of credibility is not issue-specific.  It is a cumulative process.  Only when all the strengths and weaknesses of
    a witness’ testimony have been evaluated can a final credibility determination
    be made, based on all the witness’ evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, when the trial judge’s reasons are read
    in their entirety, I am satisfied that she considered C.R.’s evidence as a
    whole and concluded that many factors justified its rejection.  In addition to citing several inconsequential
    defects in C.R.’s evidence, the trial judge also rejected significant parts of
    his testimony on the basis that they were improbable or internally
    inconsistent.  Of the many illustrations
    relied on by Crown counsel before this court, two examples suffice to make this
    point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as I have said, C.R. denied that the First
    Assault ever occurred.  Instead, on his
    account, he and J.P. engaged in anal intercourse only once – on a consensual
    basis and with the assistance of lubricants – at a time when C.R. knew that
    anal intercourse posed a risk of aggravating J.P.’s ulcerative colitis.  The trial judge rejected C.R.’s claim of
    consensual anal intercourse, essentially on the basis that it was
    improbable.  In particular, she pointed
    out that although C.R. maintained that he knew of the risk of injury to J.P.
    from anal intercourse, he testified that he never asked J.P. “at any point
    during or after the event if it caused her pain or any complications”.  Moreover, in the trial judge’s view, C.R.’s
    assertion that J.P. “seemed to be enjoying” the alleged consensual anal
    intercourse did not conform to C.R.’s description of a joint decision by the
    couple not to try it again although their relationship continued thereafter for
    about 16 months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These were cogent reasons to reject C.R.’s version of the
    anal intercourse engaged in by him with J.P.  His claim that J.P. “seemed to be enjoying” herself during consensual
    anal intercourse is inconsistent with J.P.’s admitted rectal medical condition
    and, as noted by the trial judge, with the fact that C.R. and J.P. never again
    engaged in anal intercourse over a lengthy and sexually active
    relationship.  The rejection of C.R.’s
    account of this key interaction with J.P. significantly undercut C.R.’s overall
    credibility including, especially, his denial of the First Assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, C.R. described his own behaviour and
    interactions with J.P. on the night of the Second Assault as essentially
    jocular and lighthearted, characterized by innocuous conversation.  Yet, he also admitted that J.P. eventually
    called her father for a ride home although C.R. had promised to drive her; that
    J.P. became increasingly annoyed, irritated and frustrated with him as he
    delayed taking her home; that J.P. left the house and sat on the outside steps
    to wait for her father; that C.R. remained in the house; that when he said goodbye
    to J.P., she made no reply; that he never saw J.P. socially again and their
    bi-weekly bike trips came to an abrupt end; that he sought no explanation from
    J.P. as to why this occurred or as to why J.P. was upset; and that he made no
    effort to revive their friendship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Crown counsel’s submission that this evidence
    was especially telling.  In particular, C.R.
    testified that, as J.P. left his house with her father, he said “I’ll see you”.  On C.R.’s evidence, he expected their
    friendship, including their cycling arrange-ments, to continue.  But, when he did not see J.P. thereafter, he did
    nothing to seek out an explanation from her as to why their friendship and
    their bike rides were over.  This occurred
    although C.R. testified that he continued to care about J.P. and to be
    concerned about her future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, as the Crown submits, C.R. provided no rational
    explanation for the sudden collapse of his relationship with J.P.  Moreover, his version of events regarding the
    Second Assault – namely, that nothing untoward had occurred – stood in stark
    contrast to his own description of J.P.’s conduct during and after her shower
    that night.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This evidence provided a solid foundation for the trial
    judge’s rejection of C.R.’s account of events surrounding the alleged Second
    Assault.  What, then, of the trial
    judge’s treatment of J.P.’s testimony?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although C.R. argues that the trial judge overlooked or
    minimized many inconsistencies in J.P.’s testimony, he points to only one
    specific example of what he terms imbalanced treatment of the evidence by the
    trial judge.  C.R. submits that when
    examining J.P.’s and C.R.’s explanations as to how the First and Second
    Assaults affected their relationship, the trial judge discounted J.P.’s alleged
    failure to account for how the First Assault was later dealt with in her
    relationship with C.R., while also disregarding the fact that the couple’s
    sexual relationship continued for almost a year and a half thereafter.  In contrast, C.R. says, the trial judge
    underscored and rejected his evidence of what occurred after the Second Assault
    on the basis that it contradicted his prior testimony and did not “hold water”.  I would not give effect to this argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not a case where the trial judge was entirely
    uncritical of J.P. or blind to the weaknesses in her testimony advanced by the
    defence.  On the contrary, as I have said,
    the trial judge was cognizant of the inconsistencies in J.P.’s evidence.  She did not gloss over them but, rather, specifically
    addressed them, in detail.  She also
    considered, and rejected, the defence theory that J.P. fabricated her
    allegations of sexual assault.  She
    regarded J.P.’s accounts of the First and Second Assaults as internally
    plausible and not overstated.  Moreover,
    in her view, J.P. did not attempt to minimize her own admitted dishonest
    behaviour.  These factors provided ample
    support for the trial judge’s acceptance of J.P.’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, as I have outlined, the trial judge
    regarded C.R.’s evidence of the First and Second Assaults as internally
    inconsistent and implausible in several respects.  She also found that he was not forthcoming or
    candid in his testimony.  These
    conclusions are supported by the transcript of his evidence.  The trial judge examined closely, as she did
    J.P.’s version of events, C.R.’s description of what occurred during and after
    the assaultive incidents.  She gave clear
    reasons for disbelieving his evidence and for holding that it did not give rise
    to a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all these circumstances, I conclude that C.R. has
    failed to meet his obligation to clearly demonstrate that the trial judge
    applied different standards of scrutiny in assessing his evidence and that of
    J.P.  The trial judge’s reasons show that,
    on the central issue at trial, she accepted J.P.’s evidence and explained why
    she did so.  In so doing, she attached
    lesser weight to the weaknesses in J.P.’s evidence than the defence urged upon
    her.  She was entitled to do so.  Accordingly, I would reject this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. challenges the trial judge’s sentencing
    disposition on three grounds.  First, in his
    factum, he argued that the trial judge erred by characterizing the Second
    Assault as a violation of trust, an aggravating factor on sentence.  In oral argument, however, counsel for C.R.
    did not pursue this argument.  In my
    view, he was right not to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge recognized that C.R. did not occupy a
    traditional position of trust in relation to J.P.  However, this court held in <i>R. v. McGregor</i> (2008), 94 O.R. (3d) 500,
    at paras. 30-31, that any sexually intimate relationship between adults of the
    type entered into by J.P. with C.R. is founded on a certain amount of trust and
    confidence, at least to the extent that each participant may reasonably expect
    that he or she will not knowingly be exposed by the other to serious and
    obvious perils.  Responsibly, in my view,
    C.R.’s counsel did not argue to the contrary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as the trial judge noted, J.P. was with
    C.R. and accompanied him to his home on the day of the Second Assault only
    because of their prior sexual relationship and the trust that anchored it.  In this context, forced sexual intercourse by
    C.R. with J.P. violated that element of trust that informed their earlier
    relationship and grounded their continuing friendship.  This was a proper consideration on
    sentencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.R. next submits that the trial judge erred by
    concluding that the First and Second Assaults were equally serious, leading to
    the imposition of equivalent sentences.  He argues, on various grounds, that the First Assault was less serious
    than the Second Assault and that the trial judge wrongly equated the First
    Assault with a “full rape”.  In particular,
    he stresses that the First Assault lasted only seconds and that C.R. stopped
    what he was doing on J.P.’s request.  In
    these circumstances, he submits, the trial judge erred by failing to impose a
    shorter, conditional sentence in respect of the First Assault.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that, unlike the Second Assault, the First
    Assault occurred in circumstances where C.R. and J.P. were initially involved
    in consensual sexual vaginal intercourse.  This is an important contextual distinction between the two assaultive
    incidents.  Nonetheless, on the trial
    judge’s findings, the First Assault involved anal penetration, over J.P.’s objections,
    in circumstances where C.R. knew that anal intercourse could cause J.P. pain
    and discomfort due to her medical condition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the short duration of the First Assault does
    not render it less than a full sexual assault.  As a matter of law, the brevity of the incident does not detract from
    its character as sexual intercourse: <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 4(5).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with the Crown’s submission that
    characterizing the First Assault, as C.R. does, as merely a difficulty
    encountered in “negotiating sexual boundaries in an intimate relationship”, or
    to argue that its brevity reflects a lack of intention to cause harm or
    discomfort, is misconceived.  On C.R.’s
    own evidence, J.P. was not prepared to consent to anal intercourse unassisted
    by lubricants.  Nonetheless, C.R. engaged
    in anal intercourse with J.P., without lubricants, notwithstanding her protestations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, while the First Assault might be viewed as
    less serious than the Second Assault, it makes little practical difference
    since the trial judge imposed concurrent, rather than consecutive, sentences
    for the two offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I do not accept that the sentences imposed
    were excessive and unfit.  The trial
    judge recognized, correctly, that while neither assault involved gratuitous
    violence, both were inherently violent.  She considered the defence request for a conditional sentence, the
    principles that governed the fashioning of an appropriate sentence for these
    two separate offences and for this offender, and the applicable aggravating and
    mitigating factors.  I am unable to say
    that she erred in rejecting a conditional sentence in the present case or that
    the sentences imposed constitute a marked departure from those imposed for
    similar offenders convicted of similar crimes.  While a different trial judge might have imposed lesser sentences for
    one or both of these offences, or a non-custodial sentence of imprisonment for
    the First Assault, that does not render the sentences imposed unfit.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.      Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal
    against conviction.  I would grant leave to
    appeal sentence and dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
