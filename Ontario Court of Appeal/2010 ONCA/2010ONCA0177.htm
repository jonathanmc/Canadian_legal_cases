  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted
    murder and was sentenced to fourteen years’ incarceration.  The sentence imposed took into account pre-trial
    custody of fourteen months for which credit was given on a 2:1 basis.  In addition, the appellant was sentenced to
    nine months’ consecutive for one count of threatening the death of the victim’s
    family. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence for
    attempted murder and, if leave is granted, requests that it be reduced to 9
    years and 3 months, less credit for pre-trial custody.  He alleges that the trial judge made three
    errors in principle:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant
    knew that the victim was dragged under the car;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in categorizing the offence as
    one of “stark horror”; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge misapprehended the burden of proof
    relating to aggravating sentencing factors and overemphasized the seriousness
    of the offence. She admitted prejudicial and manifestly inadmissible portions
    of the victim impact statements, which affected the fairness of the
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is appropriate at this stage to include a brief
    summary of the facts to place the appellant’s arguments in context. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the victim were married for eight years.
     They have two children, ages seven (the
    daughter) and four (the son) at the time of the incident.  The couple had been separated for three months
    when the appellant tried to kill her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After separating, the appellant came to believe that
    his wife was seeing someone else.  This
    infuriated him and he talked openly about how he would “show her”.  Shortly before the incident, he told his
    roommate that he was going to kill his wife and said he would rather die than
    go to jail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 28, 2005, the victim and the children picked
    up the appellant to go grocery shopping.  While on route to the store, the appellant
    told the victim to pull the car over.  Upon stopping in an industrial area parking lot, the couple began to
    argue.  The appellant struck the victim
    across the face.  The impact was so
    severe, blood splattered onto the clothing and shoes of their children, who
    were sitting in the back seat.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The son got out of his car seat, crawled between his
    parents and took his mother’s cell phone from her purse.  He gave it to his sister, who called their
    mother’s sister.  The aunt could hear the
    children crying and the victim screaming hysterically.  The appellant told his daughter to turn off
    the phone or else he would kill her.  She
    dropped the phone, but did not end the call.  As a result, the aunt and her family began
    searching for the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the victim got out of the car and
    continued the argument.  The victim
    started to walk away.  The appellant got
    into the driver’s seat and drove the car into and over the victim accelerating
    as he did so.  She fell to the ground and
    was caught in the undercarriage of the car.   The appellant kept driving.  The
    victim was dragged by the hair under the car for 82 feet before finally being
    thrown free.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant proceeded to drive to the grocery store,
    some 8.5 km away.  He put his two
    children in a taxi and had them taken to this mother-in-law’s home.  The appellant abandoned the car and fled the
    scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two people who were leaving work discovered the victim
    that evening and called 911.  The victim
    was bleeding from the head and pieces of her scalp and hair were located near
    her body.  Her right ear had been severed
    and was found on the ground near her.  She
    was in critical condition and was rushed to the hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim’s injuries were extensive and required
    numerous surgeries.  She continues to
    require medical care and therapy.  In
    addition to the severed right ear, her injuries included: severe facial
    injuries, broken ribs, a severed right ear, severe abrasive burning to both
    legs, tendon damage to her right arm, burns to the left side of her body, a
    broken neck and pelvis, a lacerated liver and spleen, a collapsed lung and a
    broken nose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The day after the incident, the appellant called 911
    and asked if the victim was alive.  He
    told the operator that he knew who the perpetrator was.  On October 31, 3 days after the incident, he
    called 911 again and told the operator that he had a machine gun, which he
    intended to use to kill the victim’s family which led to the threatening death
    charge.  The police located the appellant
    through the cell phone call and he was arrested. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant plead guilty before Kiteley J. on
    December 14, 2006.  At his sentencing
    hearing, the appellant accepted responsibility for his conduct and read a note
    apologizing to his wife and children.  The
    sentencing proceeded on the basis of an agreed statement of facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has a criminal record from the U.S.A,
    which includes: attempted robbery in 1991, a burglary in 1992, possession of
    marijuana in 2002, and possession of property obtained by crime and possession
    of marijuana in 2003.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn now to the appellant’s arguments.  In the agreed statement of facts, the
    appellant did not specifically admit that he knew he dragged the victim some 80
    feet while she was trapped in the undercarriage of the car.  Accordingly, he submits that it was not open
    to the trial judge to draw this inference and that there was but a single act
    of attempted murder, driving over her, which was of brief duration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even accepting the appellant’s argument, he had to be
    aware of the risk he created that the victim would be trapped under the car
    while he continued to drive and he was indifferent to that risk.  On this basis, the sentencing judge was
    entitled to infer that the appellant’s conduct in continuing to drive was an
    aggravating feature because it exposed the victim to greater risk of injury and
    death.  As the trial judge stated, “Even
    if he didn’t know he had dragged her for such a distance, he <i>did </i>know that he had deliberately struck
    her with the vehicle and yet he drove without stopping to determine her
    condition”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second argument, that the offence is
    not one of stark horror, is related to his first.  Stark horror cases involve unusual features of
    brutality over and above the intent to kill.  The trial judge did not err in her
    categorization.  In continuing to drive,
    the appellant exhibited brutality and callous indifference to the victim’s
    plight.  The trial judge used the phrase
    “stark horror” when describing the impact of the extensive and serious physical
    and emotional injuries the victim suffered.  She did not exaggerate the appellant’s moral
    blameworthiness or overemphasize the seriousness of the offence.  Nor did she misapprehend the burden of proof
    relating to aggravating sentencing factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in relation to the victim impact statements
    the Crown concedes that certain impugned passages ought to have been deemed
    inadmissible or redacted.  However,
    defence counsel did not object to their admission although having ample time to
    do so.  They were tendered at sentencing
    on December 14, 2006 and submissions were not made until January 2, 2007.  In all of the circumstances, the sentencing
    proceedings were not unfair. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the global sentence, we see no basis
    to interfere. While the sentence may have been at the high end of the range it
    reflects the moral culpability of the appellant.  As the trial judge noted there are numerous
    aggravating features in this case.  They
    include the following:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the domestic context of the offence; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>after the appellant deliberately drove over the victim
    with his car he continued to drive knowing he had created the risk that she was
    trapped underneath thereby exposing her to the risk of greater injury and death;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the violence took place in front of the children; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant beat the victim inside his car prior to
    attempting to kill her;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant’s treatment of the children in the car;
    and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>the</span> physical injuries and
    emotional trauma suffered by the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentence was not unfit.  Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, the appeal as to sentence is dismissed. </p>
