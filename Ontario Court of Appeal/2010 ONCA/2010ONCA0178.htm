    attack on the complainant.  They argued
    self-defence.  The appellant testified
    while the co-accused did not; rather, the Crown tendered the co-accused’s
    statement to the police as evidence for the truth of its content.  The trial judge </span><span lang=EN-GB
style='line-height:200%;'>held
    that the cuts and damage to the complainant constituted wounding; she </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>categorically rejected the
    claim of self-defence and found both the appellant and co-accused guilty of
    aggravated assault.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:200%;'>The trial judge imposed a sentence of
    12 months in jail for the aggravated assault, followed by 12 months probation,
    a DNA order and <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 109 order for 10 years.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'>He appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal his

  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>BACKGROUND FACTS </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On March 16, 2007, the appellant and several
    friends, including his co-accused at trial, went to a local bar.  It is agreed that shortly after midnight the
    appellant threw a beer bottle at the complainant and that the co-accused threw
    a beer mug.  Both struck the complainant
    in the face.  The beer bottle knocked him
    unconscious and he suffered lacerations and an injury to his jaw.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> At trial, the Crown claimed the assault was
    retaliation for the complainant’s earlier accusation that the appellant and his
    friends had stolen his bag.  The defence
    claimed that the co-accused had made a comment about the complainant’s pool
    playing abilities to which the complainant responded by pulling a knife.  The co-accused then went to the appellant and
    told him about the knife.  The appellant
    approached the complainant to try to calm things down, and the complainant
    charged at him while reaching into his pocket.  In self defence, the appellant and co-accused threw their drinks at the complainant
    and were then asked to leave.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> At trial, the Crown called the complainant, a
    cleaner at the bar, and the bar’s owner to testify.  The latter two Crown witnesses saw a bottle
    and mug thrown at the complainant.  Neither saw an earlier altercation and neither saw a knife.  No knife was found on the complainant,
    although police admit he was never searched.  The Crown also submitted notes of a statement made by the co-accused to
    police after the incident in which no knife was mentioned.  The Crown also submitted a statement made by
    the co-accused to the police after his arrest in which he did not mention the complainant
    having a knife.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The defence called the appellant and two of the
    friends who were with him that night.  Both friends agreed with the basic narrative of an earlier altercation,
    a knife, and the complainant reaching into his pocket when the appellant and
    co-accused threw their beverages.  However, one described the complainant as walking, while the other
    described him as charging.<span style='line-height:
200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The trial judge found that the complainant never
    pulled a knife, and that while he may have approached the appellant, he was not
    aggressive in doing so. She found the defence evidence unbelievable and the
    product of collusion, and rejected the claims of self-defence. She found that
    the appellant and his co-accused engaged in an unprovoked attack. <span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>APPEAL ON THE MERITS </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The appellant’s main ground of appeal is his
    assertion that the trial judge erred in using the out of court statement of the
    co-accused as evidence against him.  Before addressing this issue, however, I will briefly comment on the
    other grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant, which I reject.</p>
  <h4><i><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(i)        Common Enterprise </span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Here the appellant argues that the trial judge
    treated the appellant and the co-accused as acting in a joint enterprise, and
    therefore failed to evaluate the actions of each accused separately.  I disagree.  <span style='line-height:200%;'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;'>The trial judge considered the
    actions of the appellant and the co-accused as principals.  She found that each of them made a
    significant contribution to the assault and in our view there was no need for
    her to determine the exact factual extent of the harm occasioned by each.   Both are legally responsible for the full
    extent of the harm.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;'>In this case there was no question
    that the appellant hit the complainant squarely in the face with a beer bottle,
    which shattered on impact and caused the complainant to fall to the floor.  The appellant, therefore, materially
    contributed to the wounds suffered by the complainant.  </span></p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>            (ii)       Self-Defence<span style='color:black'> </span></span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The appellant submits that the trial judge
    failed to consider the question of whether the Crown had negated
    self-defence.  He says that she failed to
    consider whether the appellant reasonably believed himself to be subject to an
    unlawful assault and whether he used reasonable force to repel the
    assault.    <span style='line-height:200%;'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;'>While the appellant’s statement of
    the law is correct, I disagree that the trial judge failed to consider it.  Indeed, she considered every issue the
    appellant relied upon to ground his subjective belief in the need to resort to
    self-defence.  She rejected the
    self-defence claim in its entirety.  In
    doing so she found that there was no knife, and that the defence witnesses
    colluded in giving their confirmatory evidence.  In my view, she properly concluded that there was no evidentiary basis
    for a self-defence claim. </span></p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>            (iii)     Ignoring Relevant Evidence </span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The trial judge found that the bar owner
    observed no aggressive conduct by the complainant, and that an employee
    observed no aggressive conduct by the appellant.  The appellant argues that the trial judge
    failed to properly understand their evidence; if she had, he says, she may have
    found support for the appellant’s self-defence claim.  That is to say, the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence.  <span
style='line-height:200%;'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;'>Contrary to the appellant’s
    arguments, the evidence of the two Crown witnesses was not in conflict with the
    findings made by the trial judge.  The
    owner only testified that he saw the two men close together and that he saw the
    complainant say “one word”, without hearing what it was.  He did not see any aggressive conduct.  The employee testified to “bickering” not
    aggressiveness.  Thus, the findings by
    the trial judge do not arise out of any misapprehension of the evidence on her
    part.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The appellant also argues that the Crown led
    statements made by the appellant in chief that contained both inculpitory and
    exculpatory aspects. He says that the trial judge erred by considering only the
    inculpitory portions.  Again, I
    disagree.  <span style='"Times New Roman";'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The agreed statement of fact filed at trial
    stipulated that the appellant informed police that the co-accused told the
    appellant that the complainant pulled a knife on the co-accused, but explained
    that the throwing of the bottle was in response to the complainant throwing a
    pool cue.  This conflicted with the
    appellant’s trial evidence.  The trial
    judge was entitled to consider the inconsistency between the version of the
    story told by the appellant in the agreed statement of fact and the story he
    told on the stand.  There is no error.</p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>            (<span
class=GramE>iv</span>)      Out of Court
    Statements </span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> No one takes issue with the fundamental
    principle of law that in a trial an out of court statement made by one accused
    is not admissible as evidence against a co-accused for any purpose: see <i><span lang=EN-GB>R. v. Parberry </span></i><span lang=EN-GB>(2005) 202 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (Ont. C.A.)</span>.  It is presumed that the trial judge knew this
    law. <span style='line-height:200%;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>I do, however, acknowledge that the reasons of
    the trial judge are lacking in clarity in respect of her treatment of this
    fundamental legal principle.  Indeed, if
    she was alive to this issue she has failed to demonstrate it. </span><span
style='line-height:200%'> <span style='color:black'>I accept that a
    reasonable reading of the trial judge’s reasons for decision gives rise to the regrettable
    conclusion that she improperly considered the statement of the co-accused in
    deciding the guilt or innocence of the appellant.</span></span> <span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>Given that the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate
    the error of law alleged, I turn to consider the curative proviso<i> </i>s.&nbsp;686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span><i>b</i>)(iii)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In doing so I find that the error caused
    no harm and had no effect on the verdict, as I explain below. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>An appellate court is justified in refusing to
    allow an appeal against a conviction if the Crown satisfies it that the error
    of law falls into one of two categories: (i) minor errors that could not
    possibly have affected the verdict; and (ii) more serious errors that were
    committed in the face of an overwhelming case against the accused.  The underlying question is always whether the
    verdict would have been the same if the error had not been committed: <i>R. v. </i><i>Van</i>, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716,
    para. 36.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>I consider the error by the trial judge to be serious because
    it appears to have been used by her in assessing the appellant’s
    credibility.  That of course was
    essential to the appellant’s claim of self-defence and to reasonable
    doubt.  Nevertheless, and as I said, I do
    not believe the result of his trial would have been any different had the
    alleged error not occurred.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>The co-accused did not advance a cutthroat defence; rather,
    the appellant relied on virtually the same account as the co-accused to advance
    the same defence.  Second, and
    importantly, where the appellant’s evidence was inconsistent with co-accused’s
    statement, it was similarly inconsistent with other admissible evidence.  </span></p>

    argument depended on the co-accused telling him that the complainant had pulled
    a knife on the co-accused.  In this way,
    the appellant’s account was corroborated by the co-accused’s account of
    events.  Although a co-accused’s
    statement could not be used either for or against the appellant, the
    co-accused’s statement was far less prejudicial insofar as there are no
    incriminating allegations.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge did not need the co-accused’s statement to
    find that that the story about the knife had been fabricated or to reject the
    claim of self-defence.  In every instance
    where the trial judge noted an inconsistency between the appellant’s evidence
    and the co-accused’s statement, she cited further substantial evidence - other
    than the co-accused’s statement - to support her finding that the appellant was
    not credible.  This included blood
    evidence that the trial judge found demonstrated that there was a pool table
    between the complainant and the appellant at the time the complainant was
    struck.  From this, she concluded that
    the complainant had not charged toward the appellant.  </span></p>

'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>Additionally, the trial judge found that the evidence of the
    appellant and the two witnesses he called was contradictory in several
    respects, including the colour of the alleged knife, whether the blade was extended,
    and whether the complainant walked or charged toward the appellant.  The trial judge therefore found the evidence
    of these witnesses not to be credible and relied instead on the evidence of the
    complainant and the two other Crown witnesses. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%;'>In sum, the trial judge did not
    believe the appellant, she did not believe the co-accused’s account in his
    statement, and she found that the other defence witnesses colluded in giving
    their confirmatory evidence. I am confident, on this record, that the verdict would
    have been the same had the error noted above not been made.  This is an appropriate case, in my view, to
    apply the curative proviso. </span></p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>SENTENCE </span></h4>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Recent events resulted in the revocation of the
    appellant’s bail pending appeal and the appellant abandons his request for a
    conditional sentence.  Nevertheless, he
    continues to maintain that his sentence was too harsh for a first time
    offender.  I disagree.  <span style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge considered relevant aggravating
    circumstances, mitigating factors, and that the appellant was considered a
    first offender for purposes of sentencing and had not served a custodial
    sentence before.  She held that even
    though the appellant was technically a youthful first offender, the degree of
    violence in this case required that denunciation and general deterrence
    operated as the paramount sentencing objectives in this case.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber> <span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>I can find no error on the part of the trial judge and her
    conclusions are entitled to a high degree of deference from this court.  In view of the circumstances of this offence
    and this offender, the one-year custodial term imposed in this case cannot be
    said to fall outside the appropriate range of sentence. Accordingly, I would
    grant leave to appeal the sentence imposed, but dismiss the appeal. </span></p>

    but I would dismiss it. </span></p>
