style='font-weight:normal'>:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>This
    is an application by an individual, John <span class=SpellE>Magno</span>, for
    leave to intervene on a constitutional question raised in two forthcoming
    criminal appeals, <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Roks</span> </i>and <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Shand</span></i>.  The
    applicant submits that he has a direct interest in the constitutional question,
    and that he will make a useful contribution to this court’s consideration of
    the issue.  The appellants <span
class=SpellE>Roks</span> and <span class=SpellE>Shand</span> consent to the
    proposed intervention.  The Crown opposes
    it.  For the following reasons, I
    conclude that the application should be granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>THE FACTS</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>On
    December 24, 2001, Woodbine Building Supplies, located at 2055 <span
class=SpellE>Danforth</span> Avenue in Toronto, was destroyed by arson.  The applicant and his two brothers owned the
    business.  The arsonist, Tony <span
class=SpellE>Jarcevic</span>, died in the fire.  Another person, John <span class=SpellE>Paskalis</span>, was also
    present and was severely burned.  It was
    the Crown’s theory that the arson was orchestrated by <span class=SpellE>Paskalis</span> and the appellant, <span class=SpellE>Roks</span>, and was committed with the
    knowledge of and on the instruction of the applicant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Both <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> and the applicant were charged with second
    degree murder in <span class=SpellE>Jarcevic’s</span> death pursuant to s.
    229(c) of the Criminal Code.  That
    section provides that culpable homicide is murder:</p>
  <p class=doubleindent-quote1 style='line-height:normal;'><span
class=GramE>where</span> a person, for an unlawful object, does anything that
    he knows or ought to know is likely to cause death, and thereby causes death to
    a human being, notwithstanding that he desires to effect his object without
    causing death or bodily harm to any human being.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> was tried first and was convicted in
    June 2007 by Epstein J. sitting without a jury.  He appeals to this court on a number of grounds, including the
    constitutionality of s. 229(c).  He
    submits that that section violates s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and cannot be saved by s. 1 because it allows for a murder
    conviction in the absence of <span class=GramE>an intent</span> to cause death
    or grievous bodily harm.  The appellant <span
class=SpellE>Shand’s</span> appeal arises out of a wholly unrelated incident
    but raises the same constitutional issue as in <span class=SpellE>Roks</span>’
    appeal.  For this reason, the <span
class=SpellE>Roks</span> and <span class=SpellE>Shand</span> appeals will be
    heard together.  The applicant’s trial
    has been adjourned pending this court’s determination of the constitutionality
    of s. 229(c).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>THE LAW</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision to grant leave to intervene is highly
    discretionary. In <i>Bedford v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</i>, 2009 ONCA 669, this court explained that where an
    applicant seeks to intervene in a <i>Charter </i>case, at least one of three criteria is usually met: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>)
    the applicant has as real, substantial and identifiable interest in the subject
    matter of the proceedings; (ii) the applicant has an important perspective
    distinct from the immediate parties; or (iii) the applicant is a
    well-recognized group with a special expertise and a broadly identifiable
    membership base: <i>Bedford </i>at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 2.  The court
    in <i>Bedford</i> also reiterated the
    “over-arching” principle laid down by <span class=SpellE>Dubin</span> C.J.O. in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great
    Atlantic and Pacific Co. of Canada</i> (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 164 at p. 167:</p>
  <p class=doubleindent-quote1>Although much has been written as to the proper
    matters to be considered in determining whether an application for intervention
    should be granted, in the end, in my opinion, the matters to be considered are
    the nature of the case, the issues which arise and the likelihood of the
    applicant being able to make a useful contribution to the resolution of the
    appeal without causing injustice to the immediate parties.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph style='line-height:200%;'>THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that his interest in the
    forthcoming appeals could not be more direct or immediate: he faces a murder
    charge on the same challenged provision arising out of the same incident as the
    appellant <span class=SpellE>Roks</span>.  If this court upholds s. 229(c), the applicant will face a trial for
    second degree murder.  If s. 229(c) is
    declared invalid, the greatest jeopardy he faces is a trial for manslaughter.  The applicant describes himself as “virtually
    a co-accused” of <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> and argues that he should not
    be deprived of the opportunity to make submissions on the constitutional issue
    simply by virtue of the timing of the various trials arising from the Woodbine
    arson.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant also argues that he could assist the
    court in its deliberations by making submissions supplementary to, but distinct
    from, those of <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> and <span class=SpellE>Shand</span> in three important areas.  First, he
    proposes to review the jurisprudence of other comparable jurisdictions on the
    constitutional requirements of fault in criminal law.  Second, the applicant proposes to make
    submissions on possible remedies if this court finds s. 229(c) constitutionally
    infirm.  Third, the applicant submits
    that he is uniquely positioned to offer the court a different perspective on
    the potential scope of s. 229(c).  This
    is because, while the applicant was alleged to have been the instigator of the
    arson conspiracy, his distance from the people who carried out the arson was greater
    than that of the appellant <span class=SpellE>Roks</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned above, the appellants <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> and <span class=SpellE>Shand</span> both consent to the application to
    intervene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown opposes the application.  It submits that to allow an untried defendant
    to intervene in a pending appeal would damage the integrity of the ordinary
    criminal process and should not be permitted under any circumstances.  In the alternative, the Crown submits that if
    the type of intervention sought here is not prohibited outright, it should only
    be granted in very exceptional circumstances, which are not present here.  The Crown rejects the proposition that the
    applicant faces any “meaningful” unfairness if leave to intervene is refused,
    beyond the obvious consequence that this court’s decision on the validity of s.
    229(c) will be binding in his subsequent trial.  This, the Crown says, is the foundation of the principle of <i>stare <span class=SpellE>decisis</span></i> and is simply how the criminal law operates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown further submits that the applicant has not
    established that he can make a meaningful contribution to the proposed appeal,
    and that the “mere assertion” that new arguments will be advanced is not a
    sufficient basis for this court to exercise its discretion in favour of
    granting leave to intervene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a general proposition, leave to intervene in a
    criminal proceeding where the liberty of the subject is involved should be
    granted sparingly: <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Seaboyer</span> </i>(1986), 50 C.R. (3d) 395 (Ont. C.A.).  In the unusual circumstances of this
    application, I am persuaded that this is one of those rare cases where
    intervention is warranted.  I arrive at
    this result for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I accept the applicant’s argument that he should
    not be prejudiced in making submissions on the validity of s. 229(c) simply
    because <span class=SpellE>Roks’s</span> trial arising out of the same set of
    facts proceeded through the Superior Court first.  In my view, the applicant stands to be
    directly and meaningfully affected by the outcome of the forthcoming appeals,
    not simply because he, like <span class=SpellE>Roks</span>, is charged under s.
    229(c), but because of the factual nexus that ties their cases together.  There is no doubt that, had the applicant
    been tried and convicted already, his subsequent appeal would have been heard
    at the same time as the <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> appeal.  As it happens, the applicant’s trial was
    originally scheduled to commence in February 2008.  It was adjourned in January 2008 when his
    then-counsel was appointed to the bench.  A new trial date of April 2009 was adjourned due to new or outstanding
    disclosure.  Both of these delays were
    beyond the applicant’s control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, questions of constitutional validity are often
    litigated using reasonable <span class=SpellE>hypotheticals</span> which permit
    the court to consider the effect of an impugned law as it applies in different
    fact situations.  In this case, although the
    applicant does not propose to add to the existing record, the fact that he is
    alleged to have been a step farther removed from the actual execution of the
    arson than the appellant <span class=SpellE>Roks</span> would provide the court
    with a helpful perspective on how liability under s. 229(c) may play out under
    various scenarios.  In my view, judicial
    economy would be served by allowing the applicant to offer that different
    perspective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, in my view, the equities of the case favour the
    applicant’s intervention.  Courts are
    very reluctant to allow <span class=SpellE>intervenors</span> in criminal cases
    where the proposed <span class=SpellE>intervenor</span> supports the Crown’s
    position.  A criminal proceeding in which
    the accused person is obliged to respond to the submissions of more than one
    prosecutor lacks the appearance of fairness: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Finta</span></i> (1990), [1991] 1 O.R. (3d)
    183 at p. 186.  Such a concern is not
    present here, where the applicant’s interests align with the appellants’, and
    the appellants have consented to the intervention.  Further, as the applicant has noted, the
    Attorney General of Canada has a statutory right to be heard in the upcoming
    appeals by virtue of s. 109(5) of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  <i> </i>If the Attorney General of Canada chooses
    to exercise that right, the court will hear two responding parties’
    perspectives on the validity of s. 229(c).  In these circumstances, the addition of an <span class=SpellE>intervenor</span> supportive of the appellants’ position would not create an appearance of
    imbalance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, John <span class=SpellE>Magno</span> is
    granted leave to intervene.  His
    participation is governed by the following conditions:</p>
  <p class=doubleindent-quote1 style='line-height:
normal;'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intervention is limited to the direct questions of
    law surrounding the constitutionality of s. 229(c) of the Criminal Code;</p>
  <p class=doubleindent-quote1 style='line-height:normal;
'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant is not permitted to add to the record;</p>
  <p class=doubleindent-quote1 style='line-height:normal;
'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intervenor may file a
    factum not exceeding 20 pages; and</p>
  <p class=doubleindent-quote1 style='line-height:normal;
'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intervenor may have 30
    minutes for oral argument.</p>
