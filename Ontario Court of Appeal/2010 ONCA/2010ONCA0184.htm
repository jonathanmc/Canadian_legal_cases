  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 13, 2006, there was a municipal election in
    the city of Sault Ste. Marie, in which Lorena Tridico was elected as a city
    councillor in Ward 4.  Based on his
    actions in that election, her father, Orlando Tridico, was charged and
    convicted by a Justice of the Peace of voting in a voting place in which he was
    not entitled to vote, contrary to s. 89(c) of the <i>Municipal Elections Act</i>, <i>1996</i>,
    S.O. 1996, c. 32 (<i>“MEA</i>”).  He was also charged and convicted of furnishing
    false information to a person authorized to receive it, contrary to s. 89(h) of
    the <i>MEA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also arising out of actions in this election, Lorena
    Tridico’s sister, Grace Tridico, was charged with the same two offences and was
    convicted by a Justice of the Peace as a party to these offences, as a result
    of assistance she gave to Vito and Natalina Muzzi on election day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orlando Tridico and Grace Tridico were convicted in
    separate trials.  Their appeals were
    heard together and, on July 20, 2009, Justice Michel of the Ontario Court of
    Justice allowed both appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Michel found that the convictions under s.
    89(c) must be quashed because the Crown did not establish that the voting
    subdivisions in the election were properly constituted under s. 18 of the <i>MEA</i>.  Without this, he found that he could not
    conclude that the voting places in question had been properly established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Michel found that the convictions under s.
    89(h) must be set aside because the Crown did not prove that the officials to
    whom false or misleading information was given had been appointed in compliance
    with s. 15 of the <i>MEA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 18, 2009, Weiler J.A. granted the Crown leave
    to appeal and ordered the two appeals to be heard together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Justice Michel
    erred in law, and that both appeals must be allowed and the convictions
    restored.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Orlando Tridico
    Trial</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At Mr. Tridico’s trial, Malcolm White, the Deputy City
    Clerk, testified that Sault Ste. Marie is divided into six wards, and that two
    members of City Council are elected from each ward by those entitled to vote in
    that ward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Tridico testified that he lived in Ward 5, but
    owned property in Ward 4, and thought that this entitled him to vote in Ward 4,
    the same ward where his daughter was running for council.  He had never previously voted in Ward 4.  On election day, Mr. Tridico attended at Holy
    Angels School and presented an application to be added to the voters’ list for
    Ward 4, voting subdivision 433.  His
    application, which showed his qualifying address to have changed from his home
    address in Ward 5 to the address of the property he owned in Ward 4, was
    accepted.  As a result, Mr. Tridico voted
    in Ward 4 at Holy Angels School.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Catherine Taddo, an employee of the city, testified
    that she was trained and appointed as an election assistant at Holy Angels
    School.  It was a voting place
    established for this election in Ward 4.  Her assigned tasks as an election assistant included accepting
    applications like that of Mr. Tridico.  She was authorized to do so pursuant to a written delegation of
    authority signed by the City Clerk, which delegated to her any or all of the
    Clerk’s powers and duties that the Clerk deemed necessary to conduct the
    election.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Justice of the Peace first concluded that the
    offences with which Mr. Tridico was charged were absolute liability
    offences.  He went on to find that: (i) under
    the <i>MEA</i>, one’s residence dictates
    where one is entitled to vote; (ii) Mr. Tridico presented false information regarding
    his residential address to Catherine Taddo; and (iii) as a result, Mr. Tridico
    voted at a voting place in which he was not entitled to vote.  Accordingly, he convicted Mr. Tridico of both
    charges.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Grace Tridico
    Trial</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence at Ms. Tridico’s trial was very
    similar.  Vito and Natalina Muzzi have
    lived at 151 Wallace Terrace for 45 years.  It is located in Ward 5.  Ms.
    Tridico assisted them in presenting their applications to be added to the
    voters’ list for Ward 4, subdivision 426.  The applications asserted that their qualifying address had changed to
    402 Albert Street East, Apartment 1, a residence located in Ward 4 where the
    Muzzis did not live, from their previous qualifying address in Ward 5.  The applications were presented at St. Andrew’s
    Church, a voting place established for Wards 2 and 4, but not for Ward 5.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Norman Fera, a city employee, was authorized to work at
    St. Andrew’s Church as an election assistant, whose assigned tasks included
    accepting applications like those of the Muzzis.  He accepted their application pursuant to a
    written delegation of authority in the same terms as that given to Ms. Taddo,
    and signed by the City Clerk.  As a
    result, the Muzzis were added to the Ward 4 voters’ list and were found to have
    voted in Ward 4 at St. Andrew’s Church.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Justice of the Peace concluded that Grace Tridico
    acted as agent for the Muzzis in presenting false information to Mr. Fera and,
    as a consequence, the Muzzis voted at a voting place in which they were not
    entitled to vote.  He therefore convicted
    Ms. Tridico of both charges.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal before Justice Michel</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Justice Michel agreed that both offences
    were absolute liability offences.  However, he quashed the convictions because he found that the legal
    requirements of the <i>MEA</i> had not been
    proven by the Crown.  He set out those
    requirements in the Orlando Tridico appeal at paragraph 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before an offence can be committed under section 89
    of this <i>Act</i>, the prosecution must
    establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the election by voting subdivision is
    properly constituted, and that delegations to each election official for each
    specific voting place are clear and completely in writing by reference to the <i>Act</i> or in complete language.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He repeated this in the Grace Tridico appeal at paragraph
    2:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I have found in the matter of Orlando Tridico,
    proof that sections 18 and 15 of the <i>Elections
    Act</i> have been complied with is necessary before the court can conclude that
    there were voting subdivisions and voting places, and that officials had been
    clearly appointed in writing setting out their scope of authority including
    voting places at which such authority could be exercised.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Analysis</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the Crown’s primary argument was that
    Justice Michel erred in concluding that compliance with requirements of ss. 18
    and 15 of the <i>MEA</i> was a constituent
    element of these offences and had not been proven by the Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To assess this argument, an outline of the legislative
    context is necessary.  The ward system
    under which this election was conducted is authorized by ss. 217 and 222 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, 2001 S.O. 2001, c.
    25.  It permits a municipality to divide
    itself into wards and have the members of its city council elected by those
    wards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>MEA</i> provides that an elector is entitled to vote once for each councillor position
    to be filled, but is entitled to do so in “only one of the voting places
    established for the area of jurisdiction of the municipality” … (see s. 51(2)).  In the election at issue, two councillors are
    elected by each ward.  Thus, an elector
    is entitled to vote for two candidates for council in his ward, but not to vote
    in any other ward.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of the <i>MEA</i> defines a person’s residence as his or her permanent lodging place and provides
    that a person may have only one residence at a time.  The respondents do not contest that a
    person’s ward is the one in which he or she resides.  This is consistent with the underlying policy
    of s. 51(2) of the <i>MEA</i> namely, that
    councillors from a ward represent the interests of those who live in the ward
    and are therefore elected by them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 45(1) requires the clerk of the municipality to
    establish the number and location of voting places for an election.  Section 28(1) requires the clerk to prepare
    the voters list for use in each voting place. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents were charged under ss. 89(c) and (h) of
    the <i>MEA</i>.  Those sections read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>89. A person is guilty of an offence and liable, on
    conviction, to a fine of not more than $5,000, if he or she,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            .
    . .</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) votes in a voting place in which he or she
    is not entitled to vote;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>. . .</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(h) furnishes false or misleading information
    to a person whom this Act authorizes to obtain information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central to this appeal are ss. 18 and 15 of the <i>MEA</i>.  Justice Michel concluded that the Crown must prove proper compliance
    with section 18 to obtain a conviction under section 89(c) and failed to do so
    in both these cases.  Section 18 reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a
name="P573_40101"></a><a name=s18s1></a><a name=BK28></a><span>            </span>18.      (1)<b> </b>On or
    before each date fixed by the Minister of Finance under section 15 of the <i>Assessment
    Act</i>, the clerk of each local municipality may divide the local municipality
    into voting subdivisions. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) If the clerk acts under subsection (1) he or
    she shall, before the fixed date, inform the assessment commissioner of the
    boundaries of the voting subdivisions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Justice Michel concluded that the Crown must
    prove compliance with s. 15 to secure a conviction under s. 89(h) and failed to
    do so in both cases.  Section 15 reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P536_36746"></a><a
name=s15s1></a><a name=BK23></a><span>             </span>15.      (1)<b> </b>When it is necessary to conduct an election,
    the clerk shall appoint a deputy returning officer for each voting place
    established under section 45 and may appoint any other election officials for
    the election and for any recount that the clerk considers are required. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P538_37064"></a><a name=s15s2></a>(2) The
    clerk may delegate to a deputy returning officer or other election official any
    of the clerk’s powers and duties in relation to an election, as he or she
    considers necessary. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P540_37313"></a><a name=s15s3></a>(3) The
    clerk may continue to exercise the delegated powers and duties, despite the
    delegation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) The delegation shall be in writing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, Justice Michel erred in both respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The simple answer to the first of these two conclusions
    is that both respondents were charged under s. 89(h), which defines the offence
    as voting in a <i>voting place</i> in which an
    individual is not entitled to vote.  The
    respondents were not charged with voting in a <i>voting subdivision</i> in which they were not entitled to vote.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In both cases, the Crown proved that the voting place in
    which each respondent voted (or, in Ms. Tridico’s case, the voting place in
    which she facilitated voting by the Muzzis) was for voters in Ward 4 and not Ward
    5.  In each case, the voters concerned
    lived in Ward 5 not Ward 4.  Neither Ms.
    Tridico nor the Muzzis were entitled to vote in a voting place for Ward 4
    electors.  In these circumstances, no
    question of voting subdivisions needed to be addressed by the Crown’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The answer to Justice Michel’s second conclusion is
    that in both these cases the written delegations to the election assistants
    were for those powers and duties considered necessary by the City Clerk to
    conduct the election.  That is precisely
    what is required by s. 15(2).  In
    addition, there was ample evidence in each case allowing the Justice of the
    Peace to conclude that the duties of these elections assistants included
    accepting the applications tendered by Mr. Tridico, and by Ms. Tridico on
    behalf of the Muzzis.  It cannot be
    contested that these applications contained false or misleading
    information.  Thus, the offence under s.
    89(h) were made out in both cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, therefore, I conclude that the Crown
    established what was necessary to convict both respondents of both charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each respondent advanced a separate argument that the
    convictions must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Tridico says that Justice Michel erred in finding
    these offences to be ones of absolute liability and not strict liability.  I do not agree.  Given the very moderate maximum fine
    available, the absence of any possibility of imprisonment, the precise language
    used, the regulatory pattern of the <i>MEA</i> and the importance of preserving the integrity of elections in Ontario
    regardless of the mental element of those engaging in the proscribed conduct,
    Justice Michel properly characterized these offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Tridico argues that the Justice of the Peace gave
    insufficient reasons to convict her.  However, this is an appeal not from the trial court but from Justice
    Michel.  More importantly, it is clear
    that the reasons at first instance presented no difficulty to Justice Michel in
    exercising his appellate responsibilities.  Had the appeal come directly to this court, I
    would have reached the same conclusion.  This argument fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the Crown appeals are allowed and the
    convictions are restored.</p>
