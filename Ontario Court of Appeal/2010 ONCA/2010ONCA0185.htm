  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the application judge’s decision
    rejecting the appellants’ request for a declaration that West Eels Lake Road
    (the “Road”) is a public highway and that North Kawartha Township is
    responsible for its maintenance and repair.  (North Kawartha Township and its predecessors
    are referred to as the “Township”.) </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Road is an access road constructed in 1978 by the
    Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (“MNR”) for the forest industry.  The appellants use the Road to access their
    cottages.  They recognize they must
    establish both the dedication of the Road as a public highway by Ontario and
    its assumption by the Township.  In this
    court they conceded there was no formal act of dedication by Ontario and no
    bylaw or other instrument of the Township formally assuming the Road.  They argued both the Road’s dedication and
    assumption are apparent on the evidence of the surrounding circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellants submitted that the evidence
    establishes that Ontario had, through its actions in pursuing negotiations, indicated
    its intention to dedicate the Road as a public highway.  Next, they submit that Ontario carried out
    that intention and dedicated the Road in fact by expending funds.  Finally, they submit that the Township
    assumed responsibility for the Road by making regular and substantial
    expenditures on its maintenance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the first two points, the appellants rely on the
    evidence of Robert Millar, a former employee of the MNR.  His evidence was that in 1997-1998 Ontario
    had reached an agreement with the Township for the dedication and assumption of
    the Road.  Ontario had spent over
    $200,000 to upgrade the Road to prepare it for assumption by the Township.  After the work was completed in the fall of
    1998, Mr. Millar expected that the Township would pass a bylaw to assume the
    obligation of maintaining and repairing the Road.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the third point, the appellants rely on the
    evidence that the Township has budgeted for and expended funds on the
    maintenance of the Road in every year since 1998 when it was upgraded by Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge did not accept these
    submissions.  He found as a fact that
    though Mr. Millar felt an agreement had been reached with the Township, at
    best, there was an agreement to agree.  The negotiations did not culminate in an actual agreement.  Therefore, there was no dedication.  The application judge also found that the
    Township had regularly sought work permits from Ontario for the work it
    undertook and had been compensated by Ontario for most of that work.  Therefore the Township’s maintenance of the
    Road did not establish its assumption of responsibility for it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We have not been persuaded by the appellants’
    earnest argument that the application judge lacked an evidentiary basis for
    these findings of fact.  In our view, the
    affidavits of Shannon Hunter filed by the Township and Robert Walroth filed by
    Ontario provide support for the application judge’s findings there was no
    actual dedication of the Road by Ontario and no clear and unequivocal
    assumption of the Road by the Township.  We do not agree that Ms. Hunter’s evidence was completely undermined on
    cross examination.  Mr. Walroth was not
    cross examined.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appellants have not demonstrated that the
    application judge committed any overriding and palpable errors in arriving at
    his conclusions, the appeal is dismissed.  The costs of each respondent are fixed, as agreed by counsel, in the
    amount of $5,900 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
