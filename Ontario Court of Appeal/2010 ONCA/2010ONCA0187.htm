style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s main complaint on this appeal is
    that the motion judge erred in dismissing its counterclaim, in which it alleged
    that the respondent was professionally negligent and breached its contractual obligations
    to the appellant in respect of services provided by the respondent to the
    appellant.  The motion judge ruled that
    the appellant provided no persuasive evidence in support of these allegations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see no basis on which to interfere with the
    motion judge’s assessment of this issue.  The appellant failed to file the best available or, indeed, <i>any</i> direct evidence on the summary
    judgment motion to support the claims it sought to advance in its counterclaim.  The only evidence filed by the appellant was
    an affidavit sworn by a representative of a subsequent purchaser of the
    appellant, based on information and belief.  The deponent of that affidavit had no personal knowledge of or
    involvement in any of the matters at issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In these circumstances, it was entirely open to
    the motion judge to conclude that there was no genuine issue for trial
    concerning the appellant’s counterclaim.  He, therefore, did not err in dismissing it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the respondent’s cross-appeal,
    the motion judge found, in effect, that the agreement between the parties was
    ambiguous as to when any fees owing to the respondent were payable.  Accordingly, he ruled that the proper
    interpretation of the agreement concerning the timing of payment to the
    respondent was a genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before this court, however, the appellant
    acknowledges that on any interpretation of the agreement, if the appellant’s
    counterclaim was properly dismissed, the respondent is entitled to partial
    summary judgment in the amounts of $220,295.83 and $30,984.45.  The appellant acknowledges that these funds
    are fees earned by the respondent in respect of tax cash refunds or tax credits
    actually received by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, this acknowledgement was
    proper.  In light of the terms of the
    agreement between the parties, there is no genuine issue for trial regarding
    the timing of payment of these amounts.  The respondent, therefore, was entitled to summary judgment regarding
    these fees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the remaining fees claimed, on
    the contract interpretation theory most favourable to the appellant, the
    appellant had already received funds sufficient to trigger a payment obligation
    to the respondent in excess of what the respondent is claiming.  By the conclusion of oral argument in this
    court, we did not understand the appellant to argue otherwise.  The possibility of a voluntary reimbursement
    by the appellant to the Canada Revenue Agency, as occurred in this case, was
    not contemplated under the agreement between the parties.  The fact of that reimbursement does not
    affect the obligations <i>inter se</i> of
    the parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent has voluntarily agreed to
    restrict its claim to an amount based on what it expects that it will be
    entitled to under an anticipated notice of reassessment to be issued to the
    appellant by the Canada Revenue Agency.  The respondent also recognizes its continuing contractual obligation to
    readjust the quantum of the fees owed to it, and to reimburse the appellant
    accordingly, as may be necessary, on the appellant’s receipt of an actual
    notice of reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In these circumstances, there is no genuine
    issue for trial regarding the timing of payment of the remaining fees to which
    the respondent is entitled.  Summary
    judgment in the full adjusted amount claimed by the respondent in respect of
    these remaining fees therefore should be granted and we so order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We reject the respondent’s claim for
    pre-judgment interest at the rate of 18 per cent <i>per annum</i> on its outstanding invoices.  This rate was never agreed on by the
    parties.  The respondent, however, is
    entitled to pre- and post-judgment interest in accordance with the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is dismissed and the cross-appeal is
    allowed in accordance with these reasons.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal and cross appeal on
    a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the sum of $10,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.  The respondent
    is also entitled to its costs of the proceedings below on a partial indemnity
    scale, fixed in the amount of $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
