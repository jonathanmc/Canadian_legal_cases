  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In February 1997, the
    appellant, Doreen <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>, underwent a <span
class=SpellE>laparoscopically</span> assisted vaginal hysterectomy (L.A.V.H.).  Her gynecologist, Ronald Dowd, performed the
    hysterectomy.  Eight days after her
    surgery, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> became severely ill: her symptoms
    included pain, a fever, chills and rectal bleeding.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent, Peter Willard,
    a general surgeon, performed an exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> on Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>.  He found that she had a badly infected pelvic hematoma.  He also suspected that she had a hidden
    rectal injury so he performed a colostomy to divert Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> fecal stream.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two weeks after her surgery,
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> began to pass feces through her
    vagina.  A barium enema showed that a
    part of her small bowel had adhered to her vaginal vault, and that she had
    developed an <span class=SpellE>ileovaginal</span> fistula – that is, a
    connecting tunnel between her small bowel and her vagina.  Later, the fistula was surgically
    repaired.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> sued Dr. Dowd and Dr. Willard for malpractice.  She alleged that Dr. Dowd breached the standard of care required of him
    because he unnecessarily used a laparoscope.  She claimed that when he used the laparoscope he burned her small bowel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She alleged that Dr. Willard
    breached the standard of care when he performed the exploratory <span
class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> because he failed to examine the small bowel and,
    as a result, did not detect the burn injury.  She claimed that the burn injury eventually caused her fistula to form.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In lengthy and detailed
    reasons, the trial judge, Carpenter-Gunn J., dismissed the action.  In finding that neither Dr. Dowd nor Dr.
    Willard was negligent, she largely preferred the expert evidence called by the
    doctors to that called by Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>.  Importantly, the trial judge concluded that
    the cause of the fistula was an infection, not a burn injury.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> appeals on three grounds.  First, she
    makes a wide ranging attack on the trial judge’s findings of fact and
    credibility, contending that the trial judge either failed to consider or
    misapprehended important evidence.  Second, she contends that by finding that Dr. Willard examined her small
    bowel, the trial judge erred in law in admitting and relying on a report Dr.
    Willard had sent to his insurer six weeks after he performed the <span
class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>.   Third,
    she contends that in finding that an infection, and not a burn injury, caused
    the fistula, the trial judge erred in law by applying the “but for” test for
    causation instead of the “material contribution” test.  </span></p>

    hysterectomy.  She ended up with a
    serious rectal injury.  At trial, the
    plaintiffs and the defence debated how and why this injury occurred.  </span></p>

    Dowd burned Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel during the
    laparoscopic part of the hysterectomy.  They faulted Dr. Dowd not for the burn itself, but for using a laparoscope.  They claimed that the laparoscope served no
    useful purpose, and instead introduced a foreseeable risk of a burn injury not
    otherwise present.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the plaintiffs,
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> burn injury caused the symptoms she
    experienced two weeks after her hysterectomy.  Dr. Willard, however, did not detect the burn injury when he did an
    exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>.  The plaintiffs claimed that he “did not run
    the small bowel” – in other words, he did not examine Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel thoroughly or at all.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>,
    the burned section of Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence contended that the
    use of a laparoscope to assist in the vaginal hysterectomy performed on Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> was appropriate.  It made the procedure easier and safer.  Moreover, Dr. Dowd did not burn Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel during the procedure.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During the exploratory <span
class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>, Dr. Willard properly examined Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel.  He did not find a burn injury because there was none.  After the <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>,
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel moved back into position in
    her abdomen.  When that happened, part of
    her small bowel rested against her vaginal vault.  An infection and inflammation caused a fistula
    to form where the small bowel and vaginal vault touched.</span></p>

    he burned her small bowel, and when Dr. Willard did an exploratory <span

    of fact and credibility adverse to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> on each
    of these four planks.  Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> main argument on appeal challenges these
    findings.  She submits that the trial
    judge failed to consider important evidence bearing on her case, and that in
    some areas the trial judge misapprehended the evidence.  An attack on a trial judge’s findings of fact
    and credibility is usually a difficult argument to maintain in an appellate
    court.  In my opinion, it does not
    succeed on this appeal.</span></p>

    albeit briefly, the trial judge’s findings are well supported in the evidence.  They reflect not a disregard or
    misapprehension of important testimony, but rather an acceptance of the
    evidence given by the respondent doctors and their experts and a rejection of
    the evidence given by key experts called on behalf of Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>.  Nor can it be said that the trial judge’s
    findings of fact and credibility are conclusory.  In every case, she gave reasons for her
    findings of fact and for preferring the evidence of one expert to that of
    another.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Dowd testified that Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> had insufficient <span class=SpellE>prolapse</span> – that is, descent of her uterus into her vaginal canal – to feel comfortable
    performing the hysterectomy without a laparoscope.  His testimony was supported by the opinion
    evidence of the defence expert, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span>, who said
    that Dr. Dowd met the standard of care in doing a <span class=SpellE>laparoscopically</span> assisted vaginal hysterectomy.  In Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Vilos</span>’ view, the risk of a burn injury to the small bowel
    was miniscule.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge accepted the
    evidence of Dr. Dowd and Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> and she rejected
    the contrary opinion evidence of the plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Leyland, who
    maintained that the laparoscope added risks without clear benefits.  The trial judge described Dr. Leyland as
    “dogmatic” based on his refusal to recognize widely published medical
    literature, and found that hindsight reasoning permeated much of his
    evidence.  She held, at para. 252:
    “Rather, I agree with Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> that the benefits of
    the L.A.V.H. outweighed any potential risks connected with the procedure.”  Ultimately, the trial judge concluded, at
    para. 259, “…that it was not below the standard of care to offer an L.A.V.H. to
    [Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>] given the specifics of her uterus.”  I see no reviewable error in these findings.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge mainly
    addressed whether Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> had suffered a burn
    injury in her analysis of factual causation – what caused the fistula – which I
    will come to.  However, the trial judge’s
    reasons also show that she thought it highly unlikely Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel had been burned by the laparoscope.  Again, as she was entitled to do, the trial judge accepted and relied on
    the evidence of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span>.  At para. 255 of her reasons, she noted:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span>’ views
    with respect to the standard of care.  When Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> was given Dr. Gentle’s theory
    that a burn injury occurred during the L.A.V.H., Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> indicated that the “geography does not match.”  He felt that it did not make sense that there was any inadvertent
    touching during the procedure which may have given rise to any injury to the
    bowel.</p>

    contentious issue at trial.  The defence
    accepted that if Dr. Willard did not examine Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> small bowel during the exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> then he
    would have been negligent.  The trial
    judge, however, concluded that Dr. Willard’s examination of Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> met the standard of care.  She accepted Dr. Willard’s evidence that he
    examined Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> entire bowel, including her
    small bowel, and that he found no abnormalities or perforations on the small

    Dr. Willard’s testimony.  The exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> took close to two hours.  The experts called on this issue, including
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> expert, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Colapinto</span>,
    testified that examining the small bowel is part of an exploratory <span
class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>, and in an exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> of that duration it would be inconceivable not to check the small bowel.  Moreover, if Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> had suffered a burn injury during the hysterectomy procedure, that burn would
    have been obvious when Dr. Willard performed the exploratory <span

    small bowel, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> submits that the finding is

    inadmissible evidence: Dr. Willard’s April 24, 1997 note to his counsel.  I do not accept this submission.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The facts that give rise to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> submissions are as follows.  Immediately after performing the exploratory <span
class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> (on March 8, 1997), Dr. Willard dictated a brief
    post-operative note.  In this note, he
    said in part that he “carefully examined the bowel for signs of perforation but
    could find none.”  Although he did not specify
    in his note that he had examined the small bowel, in his evidence at trial Dr.
    Willard maintained that the reference in his note to “bowel” included both the
    large and the small bowel.  The trial
    judge accepted Dr. Willard’s testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Several days after performing
    the exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> on Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>,
    Dr. Willard went on holidays.  When he
    returned, he learned that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> was unhappy and
    had transferred to another hospital.  Dr.
    Willard called his insurer, the Canadian Medical Protective Association, who
    appointed legal counsel.  On the advice
    of that counsel, Dr. Willard prepared his April 24, 1997 note, outlining what
    he had done during the exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>.  This note was far more detailed than the
    post-operative March 8, 1997 note.  In
    it, unlike the March 8 note, Dr. Willard said specifically that he had examined
    the small bowel:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We therefore next proceeded to insert a rigid <span
class=SpellE>sigmoidoscope</span> and insufflate the rectum after filling the
    pelvis with fluid.  There was no evidence
    of leakage of air.  The fluid was
    therefore suctioned and we then went onto a full <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> examining the small bowel from the ligament of <span class=SpellE>Treitz</span> to the <span class=SpellE>ileocecal</span> valve and the colon from the <span
class=SpellE>cecum</span> to the rectum.  No obvious injuries to the small bowel or colon could be seen and there
    was no evidence of bowel content leakage.</p>

    the trial judge found that the two notes did not differ significantly.  And she accepted Dr. Willard’s explanation for
    why he wrote the April 24, 1997 note:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was also much discussion as to why Dr.
    Willard dictated a further note dated April 24, 1997 concerning the <span
class=SpellE>laparotomy</span> performed on March 8, 1997.  In my view, Dr. Willard provided a plausible
    explanation as to why the second note was done.  I find it is quite a normal procedure that when a professional
    negligence insurer asks for such information that a doctor would provide
    same.  I do not find that the original
    operative note of March 8<sup>th</sup>, 1997 is significantly different for the
    second note done on April 24<sup>th</sup>, 1997.  The April 24<sup>th</sup>, 1997 document
    simply provides more detailed information and I do not see it as
    self-serving.  The March 8<sup>th</sup> O.R. note is much shorter given that it was dictated immediately after the
    surgery and before the surgeon sees the family.  He confirmed, in his examination-in-chief that he did all that was
    described in the more detailed note of April 24<sup>th</sup>, 1997 and that he
    cited the direction that he examined the bowel in that order as that is the way
    he thinks of it even though he works in a different order.  I accept this explanation. </p>

    was both self-serving and unreliable as Dr. Willard wrote it only after he knew
    a problem had arisen concerning his exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> submits
    that the trial judge ought not to have admitted the note, or at least ought not
    to have used it to confirm the reliability of Dr. Willard’s trial
    testimony.  In making this submission,
    she relies on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Stirling</span></i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 272, which stands for the proposition that prior consistent
    statements ordinarily are inadmissible because they are viewed as self-serving
    and lacking probative value.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, Dr. Willard’s April
    24, 1997 note figured only marginally, if at all, in the trial judge’s finding
    that he examined the small bowel.  Indeed,
    her findings on this issue were based on her interpretation of the March 8,
    1997 post-operative note, Dr. Willard’s testimony and the expert evidence.  As I read her reasons, the trial judge
    referred to the April 24, 1997 note to address Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> argument that it differed markedly from the post-operative note and thus
    undermined Dr. Willard’s trial testimony.  I would not give effect to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> submission on the note or to her challenge to the trial judge’s finding that Dr.
    Willard was not negligent.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>As I have said, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> maintained that
    the fistula resulted from a burn injury to her small bowel; the defence
    maintained that it resulted from inflammation and an infection.  The trial judge resolved this issue in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of the defence (at para. 291): “Based on all of the
    evidence that was before the court, I find that the fistula was caused by
    inflammation and infection.  It had
    nothing to do with a thermal injury of the small bowel.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In making this finding, the
    trial judge once again relied principally on the evidence of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Vilos</span>.  She
    summarized his opinion at para. 285 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> said that
    fistulas can occur either because of trauma to an area or infection.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> stated
    that infection is the most common cause of fistula.  It was his view that because the vagina vault
    was not closed until March 20<sup>th</sup>, 1997, it made it easier for the
    bacteria to travel as they only had to go through one wall.  I note from Dr. <span class=SpellE>Gagic’s</span> evidence that as of March 20<sup>th</sup>, 1997 the pelvis continued to be
    infected.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Vilos</span> said that this infection likely caused the fistula.  I accept this evidence.  He said that the plaintiff’s theory of the
    thermal injury causing the fistula was extremely unlikely.  In order for the plaintiff’s theory to hold
    up, it would require that the exact portion of the injured bowel namely about
    one centimetre out of 600 centimetres to have directly attached and adhered to
    the small vaginal stump after the necessary exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>.  It was his view that the rectal bleeding that
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> had could have been a result of taking two
    Advil every four hours at the time which she presented at the hospital on March
    8, 1997.  I accept his theory in this
    regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Conversely, the trial judge did
    not accept the evidence of Dr. Wilson and Dr. Gentles, two experts for Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro</span>, who gave the opinion that a burn injury had caused
    the fistula to form.  She gave cogent
    reasons for rejecting their evidence.  Dr. Wilson “made a number of erroneous assumptions and factual errors in
    forming his opinion.”  Indeed, Dr. Wilson
    conceded that parts of his expert reports were wrong and misleading and that he
    had made mistakes.  The trial judge
    rightly concluded that his evidence was to be given little weight.  Dr. Gentles was inconsistent in his report
    and in his evidence on the mechanism by which the laparoscope could have burned
    the small bowel.  The trial judge concluded
    that his evidence was not helpful.  </span></p>

    evidence that grounded her finding.  However, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> puts forward a legal

    the “material contribution” test.  </span></p>

    sent for laboratory examination.  Unfortunately, the sample was lost, thus preventing a pathological determination
    of the cause of the fistula.  In the
    light of the lost sample, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> argues that the
    trial judge placed too heavy a burden on her to prove causation.  The parties had put forward two competing causes
    of the fistula: burn and infection.  Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> maintains that the trial judge should have determined
    causation by the approach taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Snell v. Farrell</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
    311.  In that case, <span class=SpellE>Sopinka</span> J. cautioned that in many instances the burden on a plaintiff to prove
    causation is too rigidly applied.  Thus,
    he wrote at para. 29 that “causation need not be determined by scientific
    precision.”  At pp. 328-29, <span
class=SpellE>Sopinka</span> J. explained:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In many malpractice cases, the facts lie particularly
    within the knowledge of the defendant. In these circumstances, very little
    affirmative evidence on the part of the plaintiff will justify the drawing of
    an inference of causation in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> submits that had the trial judge applied the approach to causation taken in <i>Snell</i>, she should have inferred that a
    burn injury caused the fistula.  I do not
    accept Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> submission for three reasons.  First, because the trial judge found that
    neither doctor was negligent, the issue of causation became immaterial.  The trial judge recognized this to be so.  Although she did begin her reasons by saying
    that she would apply the “but for” test for causation, by the end of her
    reasons she correctly noted that the question of causation had become academic
    as she found that neither doctor had breached the standard of care.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro’s</span> submission wrongly conflates the issues of standard of care and causation, or
    at least asks the court to determine factual causation before determining
    whether the standard of care was breached.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Bafaro</span> seeks to use the <i>Snell</i> approach to causation to find that
    a burn injury caused the fistula, and then to use this finding to demonstrate
    that Dr. Willard breached the standard of care because he did not detect the
    burn during the exploratory <span class=SpellE>laparotomy</span>.  This submission <span class=GramE>intermingles</span> standard of care and causation.  Yet, the
    two issues are quite separate.  Moreover,
    the question whether the standard of care was breached should be decided before
    the question of factual causation.  In
    other words, the issue of factual causation arises after the trier of fact has
    found that the defendant breached the standard of care.  That is evident from <i>Snell</i> itself, where <span class=SpellE>Sopinka</span> J.’s entire
    discussion of causation was predicated on an uncontested finding of negligence
    against the doctor.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The distinction between
    standard of care and causation, and the necessity to determine the former

    [2007] 1 S.C.R. 333.  There, McLachlin
    C.J. held, at para. 25, that the “material contribution” test is an exception
    that may only replace the standard “but for” test if two requirements are met.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, it must be impossible for the plaintiff to
    prove that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiff’s injury using the
    “but for” test.  The impossibility must
    be due to factors that are outside of the plaintiff’s control; for example,
    current limits of scientific knowledge.  Second, it must be clear that the defendant breached a duty of care owed
    to the plaintiff, thereby exposing the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of
    injury, and the plaintiff must have suffered that form of injury.  In other words, the plaintiff’s injury must
    fall within the ambit of the risk created by the defendant’s breach.  In those exceptional cases where these two
    requirements are satisfied, liability may be imposed, even though the “but for”
    test is not satisfied, because it would offend basic notions of fairness and
    justice to deny liability by applying a “but for” approach.</p>

    satisfies the first requirement, the second requirement – that the defendant
    breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff – has not been met.  On the trial judge’s findings, which I would
