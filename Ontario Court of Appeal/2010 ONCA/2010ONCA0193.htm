  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is yet another case in which the adequacy
    of the reasons provided by the tribunal of first instance is the focus of the appeal.&nbsp; The appellant claims that the reasons given
    by the Law Society of Upper Canada Hearing Panel (the &#8220;Hearing
    Panel&#8221;) for finding that he sexually harassed the two complainants, and thereby
    engaged in professional misconduct, were devoid of any meaningful explanation
    for those findings and have effectively foreclosed meaningful appellate review
    of those findings.&nbsp; Counsel for the appellant
    submits that the Divisional Court erred in holding that the reasons of the Hearing
    Panel, while deficient, were not so inadequate as to amount to an error in law entitling
    the appellant to a new hearing.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent, the Law Society of Upper Canada
    (the &#8220;Law Society&#8221;), defends the reasons as adequate in the
    circumstances and sufficient for the purposes of appellate review.&nbsp; Mr. Curry, counsel for the Law Society, describes
    this case as a simple, straightforward factual dispute: &nbsp;the complainants alleged that the
    appellant engaged in a variety of improper and demeaning sexual activities
    towards them; the appellant denied these allegations.&nbsp; On Mr. Curry&#8217;s analysis, if the
    allegations were true, the appellant was clearly guilty of professional
    misconduct; if they were not, he was equally clearly not guilty of any
    misconduct.&nbsp; Mr. Curry submits that
    the outcome turned on the Hearing Panel&#8217;s assessment of the respective
    credibility of the complainants and the appellant.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel ultimately preferred
    the reasons of the complainants and gave reasons for that determination.&nbsp; Mr. Curry submits that in doing so, the
    Hearing Panel gave reasons that explained why they reached the conclusions they
    did and offered ample scope for meaningful appellate review.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant&#8217;s attack on the sufficiency
    of the reasons succeeded at the first level of appeal before the Law Society
    Appeal Panel, failed at the second level of appeal in the Divisional Court and
    has been revisited for a third time in this court.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am dubious about the merits of arguments
    claiming that reasons for judgment are inadequate.&nbsp; Experience teaches that many of those
    arguments are, in reality, arguments about the merits of the fact finding made
    in those reasons.&nbsp; By framing the
    argument in terms of the adequacy of the reasons, rather than the correctness
    of the fact finding, an appellant presumably hopes to avoid the stringent
    standard of review applicable to findings of fact.&nbsp; Despite my scepticism about arguments
    that allege that reasons are inadequate, I am satisfied that the appellant has
    demonstrated that the reasons given by the Hearing Panel are so inadequate as
    to foreclose meaningful appellate review.&nbsp; The inadequacy of the reasons constitutes an error in law requiring an
    order directing a new hearing.</p>

  <h2>HISTORY OF THE MATTER</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Gary Neinstein, is a barrister
    and solicitor, and a member of the Law Society.&nbsp; The Law Society brought forward three
    complaints against the appellant, alleging that he sexually harassed three
    women.&nbsp; The allegations related to
    events that occurred between 1988 and 1998.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The discipline hearing proceeded before the
    Hearing Panel in October and November of 2002.&nbsp; That Panel released its reasons a year
    later, in November 2003, finding against the appellant on two of the three
    allegations.&nbsp; In June 2004, the
    Hearing Panel ordered the appellant disbarred. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant to ss. 49.32, 49.33 and 49.35 of the <i>Law Society Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8, <span
class=GramE>the</span> appellant appealed the findings of professional
    misconduct and the disbarment penalty to a Law Society Appeal Panel (the
    &#8220;Appeal Panel&#8221;). In February 2005, the Appeal Panel allowed the
    appellant&#8217;s appeal, set aside the findings of professional misconduct and
    ordered a new hearing.&nbsp; The Appeal
    Panel also indicated that, had it been required to address the fitness of the
    penalty, it would have set aside the disbarment order and directed that the
    appellant be suspended from practice for 12 months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Law Society appealed to the Divisional
    Court. &nbsp;In reasons released in March
    2007, the majority allowed the appeal and restored the findings of professional
    misconduct.&nbsp; In September 2008, in a
    subsequent appeal that addressed the penalty imposed, the majority reduced the
    12-month suspension to one of three months.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In April 2009, this court granted the appellant
    leave to appeal from the Divisional Court&#8217;s order restoring the findings
    of professional misconduct.&nbsp; The Law
    Society subsequently cross-appealed from the Divisional Court&#8217;s order
    reducing the penalty to a three-month suspension.&nbsp; The Law Society sought a 12-month
    suspension.&nbsp; As I would allow the
    appellant&#8217;s appeal, it is not necessary to consider the question of
    penalty raised in the Law Society&#8217;s cross-appeal.&nbsp; For the sake of completeness, however, I
    do indicate that had I reached the cross-appeal I would have dismissed it and
    adopted the reasons of the Divisional Court on the question of penalty.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant renews the arguments
    advanced in the Divisional Court, although subsequent case law, in particular <i>F.H. v. McDougall</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41,
    has caused him to reorder those arguments.&nbsp; In addition, counsel proffers &#8220;fresh&#8221; evidence on appeal
    that he contends established a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of
    the chairman of the Hearing Panel.&nbsp; I will address the fresh evidence before turning to the other grounds of
    appeal.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h2>THE FRESH EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The substance of the proffered evidence is not in
    dispute.&nbsp; While the proceedings were
    before the Hearing Panel in 2002 and 2003, Mr. George Hunter, the chairman of
    that Panel, was carrying on a sexual affair with a client.&nbsp; In March 2007, about three-and-a-half
    years after the decision of the Hearing Panel, Mr. Hunter was found guilty of
    professional misconduct in respect of that affair and was suspended for 60
    days.&nbsp; The finding was based on
    admissions he made.&nbsp; The misconduct,
    as particularized, alleged a conflict of interest created by Mr. Hunter&#8217;s
    sexual relationship with his client.&nbsp; Mr. Hunter also faced a second charge of professional misconduct.&nbsp; However, that allegation related to
    events that occurred years after the completion of Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s
    hearing.&nbsp; That second allegation has
    no relevance to the appellant&#8217;s &#8220;fresh&#8221; evidence argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hunter&#8217;s conduct came to light long
    after Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s proceedings before the Hearing Panel were
    complete.&nbsp; Neither Mr. Neinstein nor
    those involved in his prosecution at the Law Society were aware of Mr.
    Hunter&#8217;s ongoing sexual relationship with a client at the time of the
    hearing.&nbsp; There is no suggestion
    that Mr. Neinstein could have brought these matters forward sooner than he
    did.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Greenspan, for the appellant, acknowledges
    that the evidence concerning Mr. Hunter is only relevant and, therefore, only
    admissible on this appeal if it demonstrates a reasonable apprehension of bias
    on the part of Mr. Hunter.&nbsp; A
    reasonable apprehension of bias exists where an informed reasonable person
    viewing the matter realistically and practically would conclude that the
    individual charged with the responsibility of deciding a matter would be
    consciously or unconsciously influenced in an improper manner:&nbsp; see <i>Wewaykum
    Indian Band v. Canada</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 259, at para. 74.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In argument, Mr. Greenspan submitted that one
    could test the bias argument by asking what Mr. Hunter would have done had the
    matter been raised at the outset of the hearing.&nbsp; Mr. Greenspan submits that Mr. Hunter
    would no doubt have disqualified himself.&nbsp; While this may be true, it is not determinative of the reasonable
    apprehension of bias analysis.&nbsp; As
    indicated by the unanimous court in <i>Wewaykum
    Indian Band v. Canada</i>, at para. 78:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]here the issue of disqualification arises after
    judgment has been rendered, rather than at an earlier time in the proceedings,
    it is neither helpful nor necessary to determine whether the judge would have
    recused himself or herself if the matter had come to light earlier.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the standard
    remains the same, whenever the issue of disqualification is raised.&nbsp; <i>But
    hypotheses about how judges react where the issue of recusal is raised early
    cannot be severed from the abundance of caution that guides many, if not most,
    judges at this early stage.&nbsp; This
    caution yields results that may or may not be dictated by the detached
    application of the standard of reasonable apprehension of bias.</i>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When asked how Mr. Hunter&#8217;s circumstances
    could give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in this matter, Mr.
    Greenspan offered the following scenario:&nbsp; a reasonable person, informed of Mr. Hunter&#8217;s misconduct, could
    conclude that Mr. Hunter could be disposed to deal harshly with Mr. Neinstein
    because he knew at the time he was presiding over Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s hearing
    that his own sexual misconduct might come to light and become the subject
    matter of a professional discipline inquiry at some future point.&nbsp; In treating Mr. Neinstein harshly, Mr.
    Hunter would hope to create an image of himself at the Law Society as someone
    who would not tolerate sexual misconduct in a professional context.&nbsp; That image, so goes the scenario painted
    by Mr. Greenspan, could potentially be seen by Mr. Hunter as helping him if his
    conduct ever became the subject matter of an investigation or a disciplinary
    proceeding.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The scenario painted by Mr. Greenspan cannot be
    dismissed as an outright impossibility.&nbsp; It is, however, based on speculation that goes well beyond the kinds of
    reasonable inferences that can be made in assessing a reasonable apprehension
    of bias claim.&nbsp; Individuals who sit
    in courts or tribunals and are required to make independent and impartial
    decisions have private lives. Some may do things in those private lives that
    may be improper or illegal.&nbsp; Those
    misdeeds may subsequently come to light and become the subject matter of some
    form of inquiry.&nbsp; To suggest that decision-makers
    could reasonably be viewed as being influenced by considerations of what might
    best serve their interests at some unknown future date if some past impropriety
    should come to light and become the subject of some form of inquiry is
    farfetched, and stretches the concept of a reasonable apprehension of bias
    beyond all practical limits.&nbsp; In so
    holding, I do not exclude the possibility that in a given case there may be
    evidence that elevates the speculation underlying Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s
    submissions to the level of legitimate inference.&nbsp; I do, however, reject the submission
    that the necessary link between Mr. Hunter&#8217;s personal misconduct and the
    appearance of partiality can be made on the abstract level presented on this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The proffered evidence is not capable of
    supporting a finding of a reasonable apprehension of bias as regards to Mr.
    Hunter.&nbsp; It is, therefore,
    irrelevant to these proceedings and should not be received on appeal.&nbsp; </p>

  <h2>THE ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL</h2>

    applicability of <i>R. v. W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has argued throughout these
    proceedings that the Hearing Panel should have applied the three-step
    credibility assessment outlined in<span style='display:none;'>earin</span> <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742,
    albeit in a modified version, given the applicable standard of proof.&nbsp; Counsel submits that the <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> formulation avoids treating cases like this one, which pit the evidence of the
    complainants against the denial of the defendant, as strict credibility
    contests whose outcome depends on whose evidence is preferred by the
    tribunal.&nbsp; Counsel for the appellant

    findings of credibility, the Law Society had met its burden to prove the
    allegations on the entirety of the evidence.&nbsp; The appellant draws support for this
    position from the analysis of the Appeal Panel (paras. 33-57).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    three-step approach in <i>W.(D.)</i>, or its
    purposive equivalent, must be used in assessing conflicting evidence in
    non-criminal cases was put to rest in <i>McDougall</i>,
    a decision rendered after the Divisional Court released its reasons in this
    case.&nbsp; <i>McDougall</i> involved allegations of sexual assault made in a civil
    proceeding.&nbsp; Southin J.A., one
    member of the two-judge majority in the British Columbia Court of Appeal ((2007),
    68 B.C.L.R. (4th) 203 (C.A.) (<i>sub nom. C.
    (R.) v. McDougall</i>)) had indicated that a <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis of the conflicting evidence of the complainant and
    the defendant as it related to the allegations of sexual assault was required.&nbsp; In the Supreme Court of Canada, the
    court unanimously concluded that a <i>W<span
class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i>-type analysis was inappropriate in a civil
    case.&nbsp; Rothstein J. said at para.
    86:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, in civil case in which there is conflicting
    testimony, the trial judge is deciding whether a fact occurred on a balance of
    probabilities.&nbsp; In such cases,
    provided the judge has not ignored evidence, finding the evidence of one party
    credible may well be conclusive of the result because that evidence is
    inconsistent with that of the other party.&nbsp; In such cases, believing one party will mean explicitly or implicitly
    that the other party was not believed on the important issue in the case.&nbsp; That may be especially true where a
    plaintiff makes allegations that are altogether denied by the defendant as in
    this case.&nbsp; <span class=GramE>W.(</span>D.)<i> is not an appropriate tool for evaluating
    evidence on the balance of probabilities in civil cases</i>. [Emphasis added].&nbsp; </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>McDougall</i> has direct application to this case.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel was required to determine whether the allegations were
    made out on the balance of probabilities.&nbsp; In doing so, the Hearing Panel was required to consider the totality of
    the evidence and to make credibility assessments in the context of the totality
    of the evidence.&nbsp; As in <i>McDougall</i>, a finding by the Hearing
    Panel that the complainants were credible could be determinative of the
    outcome.&nbsp; In light of <i>McDougall</i>, the Hearing Panel&#8217;s
    application of a modified <i>W<span

    people working there, including eight lawyers.&nbsp; It was very busy and somewhat
    chaotic.&nbsp; Mr. Neinstein had a corner
    office.&nbsp; Mr. Neinstein testified

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Panel has carefully weighed the law relating to

    credibility.&nbsp; The Panel is satisfied
    that C.T.&#8217;s evidence was clear and convincing proof and cogent.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Accordingly, the Panel finds that in the period from
    1988 to 1993, inclusive, the Member sexually harassed in a professional
    context, C.T. by engaging in a series of incidents involving unwelcome sexual
    advances and verbal or physical conduct of a sexual and non-sexual nature

    suggestive comments and engaging in unwanted contact or attention after the end

    unremarkable.&nbsp; Paragraph 132
    identifies the assessment of the respective credibility of S.G. and Mr.

    para. 133, the Panel describes S.G. as testifying &#8220;in a forthright and
    honest manner&#8221;.&nbsp; In para. 134
    the Hearing Panel states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Accordingly, the Panel must turn to the evidence of

    Panel made several errors including a failure to give adequate reasons.&nbsp; The Appeal Panel stressed the conclusory
    nature of the credibility findings and the absence of any explanation for the
    outright rejection of the appellant&#8217;s evidence.&nbsp; The Appeal Panel held at para. 111:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We wish to make it clear that our finding in this
    regard does not oblige every Hearing Panel to provide an exhaustive analysis of
    all of the evidence in each decision, regardless of the circumstances.&nbsp; In this case, the reasons given by the
    Hearing Panel did not need to be exhaustive.&nbsp; They ought, however, to have addressed
    the contradictory evidence related to the material <span class=GramE>issues,</span> and provided some reason for disbelieving the member.&nbsp; In particular, because the eight day
    hearing took place over a period of four and a half months, the Hearing
    Panel&#8217;s path through the conflicting evidence should have been made
    clear.&nbsp; </p>

    considered.&nbsp; Most importantly, it
    applied the correct standard of proof.&nbsp; While it did not say why it disbelieved the <span class=GramE>respondent,

    reasons for its decision.&nbsp; Reasons
    will be required where the decision in issue has &#8220;important significance
    for the individual&#8221;.&nbsp; A
    finding of professional misconduct against a lawyer obviously has important significance
    for that lawyer.&nbsp; In addition, as a self-governing
    profession, it is important that the Law Society explain its discipline
    decisions to complainants and members of the public at large in a way which
    renders those decisions comprehensible and transparent.&nbsp; A Hearing Panel can achieve those ends
    only through the reasons it gives.&nbsp; Mr.

    explaining the Hearing Panel&#8217;s decision.</p>

    purposes.&nbsp; Where there is a right of
    appeal from that decision, reasons must provide a sufficient window into the
    decision to allow meaningful appellate review to the extent contemplated by the
    permitted scope of the appeal.&nbsp; Reasons
    for <span class=GramE>a decision that describe</span> both <i>what</i> is decided and <i>why</i> that decision was made are susceptible to effective appellate review.&nbsp; Whatever other shortcomings may exist in
    reasons that adequately explain the &#8220;what&#8221; and the
    &#8220;why&#8221;, those shortcomings will not render the reasons so inadequate
    as to justify appellate intervention on that basis:&nbsp; <i>R.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A determination of whether reasons fulfill their
    purpose and admit of effective appellate review can only be made by examining
    those reasons in the context of the proceedings that gave rise to the
    reasons.&nbsp; Context includes the
    nature of the issues raised before the tribunal, the evidence adduced and the
    submissions made.&nbsp; For example, in a
    one-issue case the adequacy of the reasons given will turn on the treatment of
    that issue in the reasons and not on the treatment of matters that were peripheral
    or unchallenged at trial but have been made the focus of the appeal:&nbsp; <i>Sheppard</i>,

    exclusively on the Hearing Panel&#8217;s assessment of the credibility of the appellant
    and the complainants.&nbsp; Where a
    decision depends on credibility assessments, an appellate court, in reviewing
    the sufficiency of the reasons, must be sensitive to both the advantage the tribunal
    has over the appellate court when it comes to assessing credibility and the
    difficulties inherent in articulating reasons for credibility findings:&nbsp; <i>R.E.M.</i>,

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the majority of the Divisional Court observed
    at para. 92, the Hearing Panel made clear findings of credibility &#8211; it
    believed C.T. and S.G. at least to the extent of preferring their evidence to
    the contradictory evidence give by Mr. Neinstein.&nbsp; The reasons of the Hearing Panel,
    however, offer little by way of explanation for those assessments.&nbsp; I will address the Hearing Panel&#8217;s
    reasons as they apply to each of the complainants separately, beginning with C.T.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I can find four reasons that the Hearing Panel
    gave for preferring C.T.&#8217;s evidence over that given by Mr. Neinstein:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She &#8220;gave her evidence in a forthright
    manner&#8221; (para. 91);</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She &#8220;withstood cross-examination
    well&#8221; (para. 94);</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was &#8220;independent evidence, as noted,
    which corroborated her version of relevant events&#8221; (para. 94); and</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although there was contradictory evidence as to
    the layout of Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s office and related matters, that evidence &#8220;was
    not material to a finding of whether sexual harassment took place&#8221; (para.
    94).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first two reasons speak to C.T.&#8217;s demeanour
    and may be considered together.&nbsp; Both addressed demeanour in a generic and conclusory manner.&nbsp; There is no insight provided as to why
    the Hearing Panel found C.T. to be &#8220;forthright&#8221; and no indication
    of why it concluded <span class=GramE>she</span> &#8220;withstood&#8221;
    cross-examination.&nbsp; Bald generalized
    assertions defy appellate review.&nbsp; Furthermore, while demeanour is a relevant factor in a credibility
    assessment, demeanour alone is a notoriously unreliable predictor of the
    accuracy of evidence given by a witness:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. G. (G.)</i> (1997), 115
    C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 6-8; <i>R.
    v. P-P. (S.H.) </i>(2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 281 (N.S.C.A.), at paras. 28-30. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The third reason articulated by the Hearing
    Panel for believing C.T. is, I think, the most significant.&nbsp; It is worth repeating: &#8220;There was
    also independent evidence, as noted, which corroborated her version of relevant
    events.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first problem with this part of the reasons
    is the Hearing Panel&#8217;s failure to specifically identify the evidence it
    is referring to in this passage.&nbsp; The majority of the Divisional Court (paras. 71-73) assumed that the
    reference to corroborative evidence was a reference to the Park Plaza bill,
    notes on Park Plaza stationery indicating calls to and from Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s
    office, and the note to a Yorkville shop owner.&nbsp; The Divisional Court may be correct in
    its identification of the evidence that the Hearing Panel treated as
    corroborative.&nbsp; The point is,
    however, the Divisional Court is clearly making an assumption.&nbsp; There is nothing in the reasons of the Hearing
    Panel that expressly or by implication identifies the evidence that it was
    referring to as &#8220;independent evidence&#8221; in the passage quoted above.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming the Hearing Panel was referring to the
    evidence identified by the Divisional Court, its finding that the evidence
    corroborated C.T.&#8217;s version of events is perplexing.&nbsp; Earlier, the Hearing Panel had accepted
    the definition of corroboration put forward by counsel for Mr. Neinstein
    (paras. 11-13).&nbsp; The Hearing Panel
    accepted that corroboration meant &#8220;evidence <i>which directly supports allegations of fact</i>.&#8230; <i>Confirmation of neutral facts is neither
    useful nor corroborative</i>&#8221; (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The hotel bill, the notes on the hotel stationery
    and the note to the Yorkville shopkeeper could not possibly constitute
    corroboration of C.T.&#8217;s allegations of sexual misconduct using the
    definition specifically adopted by the Hearing Panel earlier in its reasons.&nbsp; That evidence does not directly support
    any of C.T.&#8217;s allegations.&nbsp; It
    is, at best, supportive of her version of events on peripheral matters and is
    arguably &#8220;confirmation of neutral facts&#8221;, a category of evidence
    specifically excluded as potentially corroborative by the Hearing Panel in its
    definition of corroboration.&nbsp; If the
    Hearing Panel did indeed apply the definition of corroboration it had
    specifically adopted earlier in its reasons, it erred in law in finding that
    there was any evidence capable of corroborating C.T.&#8217;s version of the
    relevant events.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The majority of the Divisional Court recognized
    that the evidence of the hotel bill and the notes could not corroborate
    C.T.&#8217;s version of the alleged acts of sexual misconduct using the
    approach to corroboration articulated by the Hearing Panel.&nbsp; However, the Divisional Court went on to
    say at para. 73: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal;'>However,
    it appears that the Hearing Panel is actually treating this evidence as
    confirmatory of C.T.&#8217;s evidence of the events of August 20, 1990.&nbsp; In order to be confirmatory, evidence
    must strengthen the trier of fact&#8217;s belief that the witness is telling the
    truth [citation omitted].&nbsp; In this
    case, this evidence, while not particularly strong, can be taken as supporting
    C.T.&#8217;s recollections of what occurred on the day in question. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The distinction drawn by the majority of the
    Divisional Court between strict notions of corroboration and the broader, more contemporary
    concept of confirmatory evidence is well established in the modern
    authorities.&nbsp; Evidence that strengthens
    the belief in the veracity of a witness can be confirmatory even though it may
    not provide direct support for the allegation of misconduct:&nbsp; <i>R.
    v. Khela</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at paras. 40-43, 52.&nbsp; There is, however, nothing to support
    the Divisional Court&#8217;s assertion that the Hearing Panel was using the
    modern concept of confirmatory evidence in its reasons.&nbsp; Moreover, even on the modern approach,
    confirmatory evidence must be directed to an important aspect of the
    witnesses&#8217; testimony and not to a peripheral or minor component of that
    evidence.&nbsp; It is arguable that the
    hotel bill, stationery and note to the Yorkville store owner were not important
    aspects of C.T.&#8217;s evidence relating to the allegations of sexual
    harassment.&nbsp; There is nothing in the
    reasons to suggest that the Hearing Panel grappled with the potential
    significance of that evidence to C.T.&#8217;s allegations and came to the
    conclusion that the evidence was sufficiently important to be confirmatory of
    her evidence.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is impossible to know from the Hearing
    Panel&#8217;s reasons what it meant by &#8220;independent evidence&#8221; corroborating
    C.T.&#8217;s testimony.&nbsp; As set out
    above, it is possible that the Hearing Panel misapplied the definition of
    corroboration it had expressly adopted earlier in its reasons.&nbsp; It is also possible that the Hearing
    Panel used a different, unarticulated definition of corroboration in arriving
    at its conclusion that C.T.&#8217;s evidence was corroborated.&nbsp; It is even possible that the Hearing
    Panel used the concept of confirmatory evidence as described by the majority in
    the Divisional Court.&nbsp; With respect
    to the reasons of the majority in the Divisional Court, the uncertainty created
    by the Hearing Panel&#8217;s reasons is not resolved by simply declaring that
    the Hearing Panel, in referring to corroboration, meant to use the modern concept
    of confirmatory evidence. That concept was never mentioned in the Hearing
    Panel&#8217;s reasons and flies in the face of the much stricter notion of
    corroboration specifically adopted by the Hearing Panel in its reasons.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have emphasized what I see as the problems associated
    with the Hearing Panel&#8217;s reference to corroboration in its reasons
    because that passage strikes me as crucial to the Hearing Panel&#8217;s
    decision with respect to C.T.&#8217;s allegations.&nbsp; The appellate court&#8217;s ability to
    effectively understand and review that component of the decision is central, in
    my view, to the adequacy of the reasons as they relate to C.T.&#8217;s
    allegations.&nbsp; I repeat, either the Hearing
    Panel misapplied its own definition of corroboration, used some unarticulated broader
    concept of corroboration without identifying the evidence that fell within that
    concept, or used the modern concept of confirmatory evidence, again without
    identifying the relevant evidence or explaining why it was confirmatory of
    C.T.&#8217;s allegations.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fourth reason given by the Hearing Panel for
    accepting C.T.&#8217;s evidence was its finding that none of the
    inconsistencies between her evidence and the evidence of other witnesses concerning
    the setup of Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s office were &#8220;material&#8221; to the
    truth of the allegations of sexual harassment.&nbsp; I accept that the Hearing Panel, having
    set out much of the contradictory evidence, was not obliged to go through the
    various inconsistencies <i>seriatim</i> and
    explain why those inconsistencies were not material.&nbsp; For example, it was open to the Hearing
    Panel to decide that while the defence evidence contradicted C.T.&#8217;s
    evidence about the existence of a couch in Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s office, that
    defence evidence also allowed for the possibility that chairs could be put
    together to form a couch like setup.&nbsp; On either the defence version or C.T.&#8217;s version of the office setup,
    the sexual contact described by C.T. could well have occurred.&nbsp; The substance of this inconsistency is
    immaterial to the ultimate question in issue.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel was not required to
    elaborate on it further.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The conclusory assertion that none of the
    inconsistencies were &#8220;material&#8221; does, however, make appellate
    review difficult.&nbsp; There was
    strongly conflicting evidence about the existence of pictures of Mr.
    Neinstein&#8217;s wife in his office.&nbsp; C.T. denied that there were any pictures of Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s wife
    in his office and testified that she did not know he was married.&nbsp; She presented herself as a person who had
    become ashamed and humiliated by the sexual relationship that had developed
    between her and Mr. Neinstein in part because she was unaware that he was
    married.&nbsp; If, in fact, pictures of
    Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s wife were in his office as the witnesses testified, it
    would be difficult to believe that C.T., who was in that office on many
    occasions, did not see those pictures.&nbsp; If she was disbelieved on this point, that disbelief could well be
    material to her credibility on the sexual harassment allegations.&nbsp; Without any explanation of why the
    inconsistencies concerning the photographs were immaterial, it is difficult to
    know whether the Hearing Panel appreciated the potential significance of the conflicting
    evidence concerning the photographs and the potential importance to
    C.T.&#8217;s credibility should she be disbelieved on this point.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of C.T.&#8217;s allegations, C.T. was
    not the only person whose credibility was in issue.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel also had to address
    the credibility of Mr. Neinstein and his witnesses.&nbsp; I agree with the majority of the
    Divisional Court (para. 92) that it is not necessarily reversible error to fail
    to give reasons for rejecting the credibility of a witness.&nbsp; Particularly, in light of <i>McDougall</i>, a finding that one party is

    with the evidence of the party found to be credible:&nbsp; see <i>R.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, I do not accept that a review of the
    adequacy of the reasons should not include a consideration of how the Hearing
    Panel addressed Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s evidence.&nbsp; The adequacy of the reasons can only be assessed
    by considering those reasons as a whole.&nbsp; In some cases, what might appear to be insufficient reasons for a
    favourable finding of credibility may be buttressed by additional reasons given
    for rejecting the evidence of a witness who gave contradictory <span
class=GramE>evidence.</span>&nbsp; Similarly,
    the absence of reasons addressing the credibility of one side of a &#8220;he
    said she said&#8221; case may impact on the adequacy of the reasons as a
    whole.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is exactly one sentence about Mr.
    Neinstein&#8217;s evidence in the part of the Hearing Panel&#8217;s reasons
    where it purports to make and explain its credibility findings (at paras.
    90-99).&nbsp; That sentence, at para. 92,
    reads as follows: &#8220;Without reservation the member denied all of the
    allegations of misconduct.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no analysis of his evidence or the
    evidence of his witnesses.&nbsp; There is
    nothing in the content of that evidence or the character of those witnesses
    that would make the evidence inherently unreliable and justify an outright, unexplained
    rejection of that evidence without any comment.&nbsp; It can be fairly said that Mr. Neinstein,
    on a reading of the Hearing Panel&#8217;s reasons, would have absolutely no
    idea what, if anything, the Hearing Panel made of his evidence, and that of his
    supporting witnesses.&nbsp; Nor can a
    reviewing appellate court know what the Hearing Panel made of that
    evidence.&nbsp; Indeed, the reasons
    suggest that the Hearing Panel, having found C.T. credible, never engaged in
    any analysis of Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s evidence.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel&#8217;s silence in
    respect of the evidence led on behalf of Mr. Neinstein renders meaningful appellate
    review of the Panel&#8217;s credibility assessments very difficult.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The observations I have made in the preceding
    paragraph have equal application in a case where a Hearing Panel finds in
    favour of the lawyer.&nbsp; Surely, if
    this Hearing Panel had found that the allegations were not made out because it
    preferred Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s <span class=GramE>evidence,</span> there would
    have been an obligation to explain to the complainants why their evidence was not
    accepted.&nbsp; Indeed, the Hearing Panel
    did give specific and relatively detailed reasons for rejecting the evidence of
    L.D., the third complainant (paras. 203-211).&nbsp; Had the Hearing Panel afforded the same
    treatment to Mr. Neinstein and his witnesses, an appellate court would have been
    in a much better position to conduct a meaningful review of the Hearing
    Panel&#8217;s decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The paragraphs in the Hearing Panel&#8217;s
    reasons following para. 94, which address C.T.&#8217;s allegations (paras.
    94-99), contain a series of generic, conclusory findings with respect to the
    individual allegations of harassment made by C.T.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel does not engage in any
    analysis of the specific evidence as it relates to those events.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The reasons relating to C.T.&#8217;s complaints
    compel the conclusion that those reasons do not address the &#8220;why&#8221;
    component required in reasons for judgment.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel&#8217;s reasons are a
    combination of generic generalities (e.g. &#8220;gave her evidence in a
    forthright manner&#8221;), unexplained conclusory observations (e.g. &#8220;withstood
    cross-examination well&#8221;), material omissions (e.g. the failure to
    articulate any analysis of Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s evidence) and uncertainty as
    to the legal principles applied to the credibility analysis (e.g. the
    corroboration finding).&nbsp; Taken
    together, these inadequacies render the reasons in respect of C.T.&#8217;s
    allegations so inadequate as to prevent meaningful appellate review.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hearing Panel&rsquo;s reasons for accepting S.G.&rsquo;s allegations offer even less insight into its decision than do its reasons concerning C.T.&rsquo;s allegations.  Examined from a functional perspective, the Hearing Panel&rsquo;s reasons relating to S.G.&rsquo;s allegations come perilously close to constituting no reasons at all.  After summarizing the relevant evidence, the Hearing Panel sets out its findings of fact, all in favour of S.G., in a series of conclusory statements, none of which offer any explanation for the findings or an analysis of the evidence relevant to those findings (paras. 136-148).&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hearing Panel does conclude at para. 133
    that S.G. &#8220;gave her evidence in a forthright and honest manner&#8221; and
    that she was not effectively challenged on cross-examination.&nbsp; I would make the same comments
    concerning these observations as I did in respect of some of the observations
    relating to C.T.&#8217;s demeanour (see above, at paras. 66-67).&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only specific observation made by the Panel
    concerning S.G.&#8217;s credibility that might assist in understanding why the
    Panel believed her is found in paras. 133 and 134:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While there were contradictions in the evidence about
    the hours she and the Member worked, <i>no
    other witness, other than S.G. and the member, were able to testify precisely
    about the specific incidents alleged to have occurred.</i>&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Member&#8217;s spouse testified that there were
    no times between 1988 and 1992 when he would be home very late at night.&nbsp; Mr. Ellis testified that while it was
    not in the normal practice for S.G. to stay late, it may have happened.&nbsp; <i>Accordingly,
    the Panel must turn to the evidence of S.G. and the Member to determine what
    specifically happened in the office and at what times.</i>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am not sure what to make of this part of the
    Hearing Panel&#8217;s reasons.&nbsp; It would
    appear that the Hearing Panel decided that, because the contradictions in the
    evidence did not relate specifically to the alleged incidents involving S.G.
    and Mr. Neinstein, those potential inconsistencies could not assist in
    assessing whether S.G. or Mr. Neinstein was telling the truth about those
    incidents.&nbsp; If that is what the Panel
    meant by this passage, it clearly misdirected itself.&nbsp; Evidence relating to matters other than
    the actual incidents could certainly shed light on the credibility of the
    evidence of S.G. and Mr. Neinstein concerning those incidents.&nbsp; For example, there were potentially
    significant inconsistencies between S.G.&#8217;s testimony about conversations she
    had with Mr. Ellis concerning Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s conduct and Mr.
    Ellis&#8217;s recollection of any such conversations.&nbsp; Those inconsistencies were potentially
    significant in assessing the truthfulness of S.G.&#8217;s evidence that the incidents
    had in fact occurred.&nbsp; If the
    Hearing Panel did not address conflicting evidence relating to matters other
    than the actual incidents in assessing S.G.&#8217;s credibility, the Hearing Panel
    effectively excluded a large body of evidence from its credibility analysis.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I cannot go so far as to say that the Hearing
    Panel improperly excluded parts of the evidence from its credibility
    analysis.&nbsp; I can say, however, that
    to the very limited extent that the Hearing Panel offers any explanation for its
    credibility assessment, that explanation suggests an improper approach to the
    evidence contradicting parts of S.G.&#8217;s evidence.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike its findings with respect to C.T., the
    Hearing Panel did make a specific finding with respect to Mr. Neinstein&#8217;s
    evidence relating to S.G.&#8217;s complaints at para. 135:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While the Member denied the allegations, taking into
    account all the evidence, and the manner of its presentation, the Panel prefers
    the evidence of S.G. over that of the Member.&nbsp; The Panel does not believe the Member&#8217;s
    blanket denials.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is difficult to imagine a more generic
    finding.&nbsp; To paraphrase my
    colleague, Watt J.A., in <i>Wadforth</i>, at
    para. 71, this finding could apply equally to any other case involving any
    other allegation against any other individual.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hearing Panel also mischaracterizes Mr.
    Neinstein&#8217;s evidence when it refers, somewhat pejoratively, to his &#8220;blanket
    denials&#8221;.&nbsp; Mr. Neinstein
    contended that none of the events testified to by S.G. happened.&nbsp; An individual cannot be expected to give
    details of events that the individual says never occurred.&nbsp; Mr. Neinstein did, however, offer particularized
    explanations to support his assertion that the events never happened.&nbsp; For example, in denying S.G.&#8217;s
    evidence about his sexual misconduct during salary discussions, Mr. Neinstein
    led considerable evidence that it was not the usual office practice for him to
    be involved in salary discussions with office personnel.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having regard to the nature of the issues raised
    by S.G.&#8217;s allegations and the conflicting evidence, the reasons of the
    Hearing Panel constitute no more than a finding of &#8220;what&#8221; the Panel
    decided.&nbsp; The Hearing Panel&#8217;s
    reasons place the &#8220;why&#8221; behind the &#8220;what&#8221;, and beyond

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The allegations made against Mr. Neinstein raise
    matters of serious concern.&nbsp; The
    proper resolution of the allegations is of significant importance to both Mr.
    Neinstein and the complainants.&nbsp; It
    is not for this court to weigh the competing evidence and make findings of
    fact.&nbsp; Nothing in these reasons
    should be taken as critical or supportive of the evidence of anyone.&nbsp; Those kinds of decisions can only be
    made by a Hearing Panel.&nbsp; </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, I think, for all concerned, the reasons
    for the findings of the Hearing Panel are so deficient as to constitute an
    error in law.&nbsp; The appeal must be
    allowed, the order of the Divisional Court must be set aside, and the matter must
    be remitted to a different Hearing Panel for a new hearing.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the parties cannot agree on the question of costs,
    written submissions may be filed with the court.&nbsp; Those submissions should not exceed five
    pages.&nbsp; The appellant shall file his
    submissions within 14 days of the release of these reasons.&nbsp; The respondent shall have seven days to
    reply. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
