    Peace of disobeying an officer directing traffic contrary to s. 134(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.
    The conviction was upheld by a provincial offences appeal court judge. The
    applicant applies for leave to appeal the provincial appeal court judge’s
    decision to this court under s. 139 of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.</p>

    police officer conducting radar surveillance on Highway 401 directed the
    applicant to stop her car because she was driving at a speed of 143 kilometres
    per hour. Although the applicant slowed down, she did not stop until pursued by
    the officer in his cruiser for approximately two kilometres.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>134(1) <span class=GramE>Where</span> a police

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a) <span class=GramE>to</span> ensure orderly movement of traffic; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) <span class=GramE>to</span> prevent injury or damage to persons or property; or </p>

    questioned the police officer concerning the basis for the stop as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.          Now,
    you agree officer that at the time you were initiating the attempt to make a
    traffic stop.  There was no emergency
    taking place at that time?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.          She was speeding.  So I wanted to pull [her] over because she
    was travelling 43 kilometres over the limit.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.          And would you classify this as an
    emergency?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.          One waiting to happen perhaps, but not
    an emergency in the sense of a car accident. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.          No.  And at the time was there any imminent risk of injury or damage to
    property or person?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.          There was if I didn’t get out of the
    way.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.          Okay, but prior to you getting into
    the road, what was the imminent risk of danger … of damage to property or
    injury to person?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.          There was none.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.          Okay.  Now, you’ve indicated in your notes and I don’t recall if you testified
    to it but there was no other traffic on the road at that time other than
    her.  Is that correct?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.          Correct. She was completely alone.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.          Okay.  <i>And so there was no potential for
    any disorder with respect to the flow of traffic?</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.          No. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Emphasis added.]</p>

    verdict arguing that the preconditions for the exercise of discretion under s.
    134 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act </i>had
    not been satisfied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Justice of the Peace dismissed the motion
    stating, “I am not satisfied that indeed … the officer did not have the
    discretion.” He subsequently convicted the applicant, holding that the elements
    of the offence had been satisfied and imposed a fine of $85.00. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal to the Provincial Offences Appeal
    Court, the provincial offences appeal court judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am quite satisfied that when he sees somebody
    travelling at that speed, to ensure the orderly movement of traffic, he has got
    to get that vehicle off the road and get it to slow down.  So the charge was appropriately made out on
    the evidence disclosed without the officer having to go through the <span
class=GramE>a.b.c’s</span> of the various conditions of the particular offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal to this court, the applicant argued
    that the Justice of the Peace misinterpreted s. 134(1) by failing to recognize
    that one of the preconditions in s. 134(1) must be met before the discretion
    under that section is triggered. In addition, she argued that the provincial
    offences appeal court judge erred by misinterpreting the word “traffic” as it
    appears in s. 134(1) as applying to a single vehicle and by making a finding
    concerning the reason for the officer’s exercise of discretion not made by
    Justice of the Peace and not supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant contends that her grounds of
    appeal satisfy the test for granting leave under s. 139 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act </i>because the
    decisions below reflect conflicting interpretations of a common statutory
    provision and also involve issues relating to the powers of police officers,
    the duties of civilians, the scope of appellate review and the elements of the
    offence under s. 134. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The threshold for granting leave under s. 139 of
    the <i>Provincial Offences Act </i>is very high.
    There must be special grounds on a question of law alone and it must be
    essential in the public interest or for the due administration of justice that
    leave be granted. As Carthy J.A. observed in <i>R. v. Zakarow</i> (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 621 (C.A.) at pp. 625-6, “[t]he
    section was clearly drafted to eliminate all but appeals on the most
    significant issues.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see no merit in the applicant’s submission
    that upon a review of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>, it is clear that the word “traffic” is intended to refer to more than
    one vehicle. The applicant did not provide examples of other sections in the Act
    that support this contention. On a cursory review of the Act, many sections,
    including s. 134(1) make it clear that the word “traffic” is intended to refer
    to one or more vehicles. To hold otherwise would lead to the absurd result
    that, for example, in an emergency involving a bridge collapse on the roadway
    ahead, a police officer could not exercise the discretion conferred by s.
    134(1) to direct a single vehicle to stop where there was no other traffic in
    the area. As further examples, see ss. 134.1, 136(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    and 138(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, I reject the applicant’s assertion
    that there was no evidence at trial to support the provincial offences appeal
    court judge’s finding that the police officer stopped the applicant to ensure
    the orderly movement of traffic. The officer testified he stopped the applicant
    because she was going 43 kilometres per hour over the speed limit. Defence
    counsel’s question to the officer concerning the precondition in s. 134(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the<i> Highway
    Traffic Act </i>related to the orderly <i>flow</i> of traffic, not the orderly <i>movement</i> of traffic. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, I do not read the Justice of the
    Peace’s reasons as meaning, necessarily, that he misinterpreted s. 134(1) by
    failing to recognize that one of the three preconditions in that section must
    be met before the discretion is triggered. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, even if the Justice of the Peace
    misinterpreted s. 134(1) in the manner alleged, even if the provincial offences
    appeal court judge erred by making a finding not made by the Justice of the
    Peace, and even if s. 216 of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> (which carries a minimum fine of $1000) is the section more
    generally used to address the type of conduct that occurred in this case, I am
    not persuaded that the applicant has met the test for granting leave to appeal.
    In my view, the proposed issues for appeal do not raise a significant issue of
    statutory interpretation; they do not raise issues concerning appellate review
    that are not already the subject of settled law; and they do not raise the
    spectre of a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application for leave to appeal is therefore
    dismissed. </p>
