  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an application under s. 18(2) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18, for
    a review of decisions made by judges in the Superior Court, detaining the
    applicant pending extradition proceedings.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The initial decision to detain was made by <span
  class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. on October 31, 2008.&nbsp; On June 19, 2009, Trotter J. dismissed an
    application for review based on material change in circumstances.&nbsp; On January 7, 2010, Kiteley J. dismissed a
    further application for review based on alleged error in principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application before me is essentially a repeat of
    the application made to Kiteley J.  The
    applicant submits that <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. erred in principle
    by denying bail on the tertiary ground, solely on the basis of the strength of
    the case against the applicant.  In
    addition, he argues that Kiteley J. and Trotter J. both erred in failing to
  recognize this error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An Amending Authority to Proceed authorized the
    Attorney General to seek a committal order for the following offences:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trafficking in narcotics contrary to the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act </i>(with
    Bob <span class=SpellE>Iucian</span>, Martin Daniel, <span class=SpellE>Ulucean</span> <span class=SpellE>Aurel</span> and <span class=SpellE>Cladiu</span> Alexa);
    and</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trafficking in narcotics contrary to the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act </i>(6
    kilograms of cocaine to <span class=SpellE>Tampescu</span> Manuela and <span
class=SpellE>Covaci</span> Tiberius Florin).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read his reasons, <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. analyzed this case starting from the premise that the offences set out in
    the Authority to Proceed are reverse onus offences. He characterized the
    Crown’s position as raising concerns in relation to the primary and tertiary
    grounds.  Concerning the primary ground, he
    concluded that the applicant’s release plan, which includes seven sureties ­willing
    to pledge approximately $900,000, would permit an acceptable release
    order.  However, he concluded that the
    tertiary ground was also applicable based on the allegations that the applicant
    “has been an executive level member of an international trafficking
    organization over a number of years”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. then turned to the
    applicant’s response to the tertiary ground, which consisted of arguments relating
    primarily to the propriety of the prosecution in Romania.  After rejecting these arguments, <span
class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. concluded that the applicant should be detained
    on the tertiary ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tertiary ground is set out in s. 515(10<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  It applied in the hearing
    before <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. by virtue of the provisions of s.
    19 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  The relevant portions of s. 515(10)(c) reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. 515(10) <span class=GramE>For</span> the
    purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody is justified
    only on one or more of the following grounds:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) <span class=GramE>if</span> the detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of
    justice, having regard to all the circumstances, including</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i) <span class=GramE>the</span> apparent strength of the prosecution’s case,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii) <span class=GramE>the</span> gravity of the offence,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iii) <span class=GramE>the</span> circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, including whether a
    firearm was used, and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iv) <span class=GramE>the</span> fact that the accused is liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term
    of imprisonment…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading his reasons as a whole, in my view, it is
    apparent that <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. considered all of the
    factors enumerated in the tertiary ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant does not contest that <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. considered the strength of the prosecution’s case.  In my opinion, it is apparent that he
    considered the gravity of the offences and the circumstances in which they were
    committed by his references to the applicant being an “executive level member
    of an international trafficking organization over a number of years” and by earlier
    references in his reasons to the particular circumstances of the offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, he observed that the second offence
    included allegations that the applicant secured the co-operation of a female
    confederate by threatening the safety of her children. He also noted that,
    although the applicant was living in Canada at the material times, there was
    evidence of travel and that the applicant appears to be living beyond his means
    in Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in my view, it is implicit in <span
class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J.’s reasons that he was aware that the applicant
    was liable to a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment.  In fact, the materials before him disclosed
    that by the time of the bail application, the applicant had been convicted in
    Romania in <i>absentia</i> (albeit in the
    presence of a lawyer he arranged to represent him) and sentenced to 14 years
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant also placed significant reliance on comments
    made by Doherty J.A. at para. 12 of <i>France
    v. <span class=SpellE>Ouzghar</span></i>, 95 O.R. (3d), 187 (C.A.), which was
    an application under s. 679 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> in an extradition proceeding for bail pending an application for leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addressing the public interest, it is important
    to understand the purpose for which the applicant is in custody in Canada.  The only reason Canada has any cause to place
    him in custody is to facilitate his surrender to France.  The applicant will not be surrendered while
    his application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is
    outstanding.  It cannot be said to be in
    the public interest to hold the applicant in custody to facilitate his surrender
    when his surrender will not take place before the application for leave is
    decided.  <i>Absent some substantive cause specific to the applicant to justify
    detention, the public interest considered in the context of an extradition
    proceeding is not served by incarceration that does not facilitate the
    applicant’s surrender to the requesting country</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not read this passage from <span class=SpellE><i>Ouzghar</i></span> as suggesting that a
    person should not be detained on an application for bail in the extradition context
    where the tertiary ground under s. 515(10) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is satisfied.  On the contrary, I read the emphasized passage as suggesting quite the
    opposite.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this case is quite different from <span
class=SpellE><i>Ouzghar</i></span><i> </i>in terms of the public interest considerations
    that are in play. Although it was alleged that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ouzghar</span> was a member of a terrorist organization, the primary allegations against him
    concerning actual terrorist activity were relatively limited; they involved participating
    in passport forgery and uttering a forged document.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Further, although Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ouzghar</span> had been convicted in France <i>in absentia</i>,
    it was acknowledged that he did not have notice of the French proceedings and
    would be entitled to a trial on the merits following surrender. Finally, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Ouzghar</span> had a long record of being on bail in Canada
    without incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of contrast, in this case, the applicant is
    alleged to be a longstanding high level participant in an international drug
    trafficking organization.  Unlike Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Ouzghar</span>, the applicant had notice of the proceedings
    against him in Romania, chose to participate in those proceedings from afar,
    and has been convicted in those proceedings and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.
    Further, by the time of the review before Trotter J., it had emerged that although
    the scope of the allegations against him may have narrowed somewhat on appeal,
    the applicant lost his first level appeal in Romania. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that detention solely on the tertiary
    ground will be justified only in relatively rare circumstances: see <i>R. v. Hall</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Laframboise</span></i> (2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 492 (Ont. C.A.); at para. 30; and <i>R. v. Blind</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 87 (Sask. C.A.). However, even though <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. concluded that an acceptable release order
    could be crafted to meet the primary ground, nonetheless, it seems to me that
    it was open to him to find that an informed public would be justifiably
    concerned about the applicant’s continued presence in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After all, the applicant has been convicted and
    sentenced in another country, in a proceeding in which he participated, to 14
    years imprisonment for high level involvement in an international drug
    trafficking organization. The charges against him include allegations of
    intimidation. It is undisputed that the record of the case supporting the claim
    for extradition is strong.  Further, subsequent
    to the hearing before <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. it has emerged that
    the applicant was unsuccessful on his first level appeal in Romania. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that <span class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. made any error in principle. The application is therefore dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before concluding, I would like to echo the comments of
    Trotter J. in <i>United States of America.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Khadr</span></i> (2008), 234 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Ont.
    S.C.J.), at para. 54, that “<span lang=EN-US>[</span><span
class=SpellE>i</span>]<span class=SpellE>nterpreting</span> s. 18(2) of the <i>Extradition Act</i> as conferring concurrent
    jurisdiction on judges [of the Superior Court] and the Court of Appeal may at
    times result in the excessive use of judicial resources.” Accordingly, “if the
    moving party wishes to allege that the judge who made the original decision
    erred in principle or law, resort should be made to a judge of the Court of
    Appeal.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, in my view, it would have been a
    preferable use of judicial resources had the applicant brought his second review
    application in the Superior Court to this court.</p>
