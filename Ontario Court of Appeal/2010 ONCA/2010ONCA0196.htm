  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, M.S. (the father), appeals the order of
    Perkins J. dated November 17, 2006, with reasons released on February 27, 2007,
    as well as a costs order dated May 31, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 16 of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), the trial judge ordered
    that the respondent, C.S. (the mother), have custody of the parties’ youngest
    child M, without access for the father or the other three children of the
    marriage (the siblings), who lived with their father and were alienated from, and
    had no contact with, their mother.  In
    addition, pursuant to s. 46 of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 3, and s. 35 of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12, the trial judge
    issued a restraining order forbidding the father to make contact directly or
    indirectly with his ex-wife or daughter M.  Finally, the trial judge awarded the mother costs of $320,198.85, based
    in part on a finding of bad faith on the part of the father throughout the long
    and acrimonious litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The father appeals on 15 different grounds relating to
    a wide array of alleged factual and legal errors made by the trial judge.  There is a good deal of overlap in the
    grounds of appeal and we do not propose to consider them individually.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge presided over a long (18 days) and
    contentious trial with many witnesses and a mountain of documentary
    evidence.  It is not our task to retry
    the case; we must approach the appeal with considerable respect for the task
    facing a trial judge in difficult family law cases, especially those involving
    custody and access issues.  As expressed
    by Bastarache J. in <i>Van de Perre v.
    Edwards</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014 at para. 13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Custody and access decisions are inherently
    exercises in discretion.  Case-by-case
    consideration of the unique circumstances of each child is the hallmark of the
    process.  This discretion vested in the
    trial judge enables a balanced evaluation of the best interests of the child
    and permits courts to respond to the spectrum of factors which can both
    positively and negatively affect a child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a preliminary matter, we observe that many of the
    grounds of appeal and much of the appellant’s argument dealt with the so-called
    “parental alienation syndrome”.  In our
    view, this focus in the appellant’s case was misconceived.  There is alienation between parent and child
    in the S family.  The alienation is
    between the three oldest children (now adults) and the mother.  This appeal, however, focuses on a different
    relationship, namely, the one between the child M and her father and,
    secondarily, her siblings.  Uniquely, M
    is alienated from no one in her family.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The focus of the trial was, as the trial judge
    recognized, on the best interests of the child M.  The evidence in support of the no access
    order, at the time it was made in late 2006, was overwhelming.  The father had taken aggressive and
    persistent steps to alienate his other children from their mother.  The likelihood of this continuing with M if
    the father had access to her was virtually certain.  The trial judge concluded that the risks to M
    if the father were given access were simply too great to serve her best
    interests.  As expressed by the trial
    judge near the end of his comprehensive reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both the father and the two oldest children
    actively participated in the disobedience of the court order placing the third
    child in foster care during the investigation of very serious protection
    concerns.  I have no reason to have
    confidence that the father or the older children would respect terms of a new
    access order, such as terms prohibiting negative comments about the mother or
    pressure on the child [M] to move to the father’s home, any more than they have
    respected previous court orders on various subjects.  I note particularly the father’s attitude
    toward the order for reconciliation counselling involving the third child
    during the protection case.  The father
    was having none of it, and neither was the child as a result.  So it could never happen.  I see no sign of positive change on the
    father’s part in promoting a reconciliation of the three oldest children with
    the mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with this description and conclusion.  The inclusion in the access order of the
    other children who are alienated from their mother is justified by the finding
    that the father has engaged them in his cause and that they operate as a single
    camp.  We also observe that there is
    nothing in the fresh evidence tendered by the father that would diminish the
    continuing applicability of the trial judge’s conclusion quoted above three
    years later.  On these facts, which are
    extreme, the maximum contact between the appellant and M that is consistent
    with M’s best interests is no contact, subject to a material change in
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The restraining order against the father strikes us as,
    in this unusual and troubling case, a logical and necessary corollary of the no
    access order.  Again, there is nothing in
    the fresh evidence to challenge its continuing appropriateness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we affirm the costs award.  It is a very large award.  However, the father’s conduct of the
    litigation over several years and the simple reality of an 18-day trial led
    inevitably to huge lawyers’ fees on both sides.  The mother won at trial and is, therefore, entitled to costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the scale of costs, rule 24(8) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24(8) If a party has acted in bad faith, the court
    shall decide costs on a full recovery basis and shall order the party to pay
    them immediately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the father’s conduct
    throughout the litigation, including persistent disobedience of court orders
    (including consent orders), and concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the father has acted in bad faith
    over a long period of time, in relation to more than one issue, and on many
    occasions.  The consequences of his bad
    faith have been a vastly prolonged and more expensive court case and vastly
    increased emotional damage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with this description of the father’s conduct
    and its consequences.  It justified an
    award of costs on a full recovery basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to her costs of
    the appeal fixed at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
