    made by a provincial Review Board directing transfer of a mental disorder
    detainee from one hospital to another would take place immediately. Not so in
    the harsh light of reality in the first decade of 21<sup>st</sup> century
    Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thomas Rea is a mental disorder
    detainee, a person found not criminally responsible on account of mental
    disorder (“NCRMD”), on a charge of criminal harassment.  At his first disposition hearing before the
    Ontario Review Board, (the “Board”) Thomas Rea was detained without privileges
    in the Regional Forensic Services Program at the Mental Health Centre <span
class=SpellE>Penetanguishene</span> (“MHCP”) under a warrant of committal
    issued by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the disposition hearing
    common ground was prevalent. The parties agreed that Thomas Rea remained a
    significant threat to the safety of the public, and that he should be detained
    in custody in a hospital. Minimum security was deemed sufficient, including
    conditions that permitted the person in charge of the hospital to extend to Thomas
    Rea certain hospital and grounds privileges and supervised community access. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The administrator of the MHCP
    was familiar with Thomas Rea, thus suggested he be detained there in the
    minimum secure unit with a range of privileges at the discretion of the person
    in charge.  Thomas Rea preferred a
    transfer to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”), a hospital
    closer to his family with whom he could visit if granted community access. His
    treating psychiatrist at MHCP acknowledged that a transfer to an equivalent
    level of security at CAMH could well be the least onerous and least restrictive
    disposition for Thomas Rea.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The treating psychiatrist at
    MHCP also expressed the view that, if Thomas Rea were to be transferred to CAMH,
    he could and should have the same discretionary privileges at MHCP during the
    time between disposition and actual transfer.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its custodial disposition,
    the Board ordered that Thomas Rea be detained in the minimum secure unit at
    CAMH with various privileges, including supervised community access, to be
    determined by the person in charge of CAMH.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But the transfer to CAMH was
    not immediate.  Six months after the
    disposition was issued, Thomas Rea remained at MHCP.  He remained there without any privileges,
    because the disposition said nothing about his interim custody there and
    nothing about any interim privileges he might be afforded while awaiting
    transfer.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue raised on this appeal
    has to do with the duty of the Board to include directions as to the interim
    custody, and available interim privileges, in a disposition that involves the
    transfer of a detainee from one hospital to another. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>        The
    Finding</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 9, 2009, a judge of
    the Ontario Court of Justice found Thomas Rea NCRMD on a charge of criminal
    harassment.  The judge was not asked and
    did not conduct a disposition hearing but, at the prosecutor’s request, made an
    order under s. 672.46(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> detaining Thomas Rea at the Regional Forensic Services Program of
    MHCP.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>        The
    Disposition Hearing</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board held Thomas Rea’s
    initial disposition hearing on April 21, 2009.  The Board considered that Thomas Rea remained a significant risk to the
    safety of the public.  According to the
    Board, the least onerous and least restrictive disposition for Thomas Rea was
    detention in a minimum secure unit at CAMH with several privileges to be
    awarded in the discretion of the person in charge of the hospital.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board disposition was
    consistent with the position of the parties at the disposition hearing.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>        The
    Availability Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Ann Jones, a psychiatrist
    at MHCP and Thomas Rea’s treating physician, testified at the disposition
    hearing.  During cross-examination by a
    Board member, Dr. Jones acknowledged that an argument could be made that the
    least onerous and least restrictive disposition for Thomas Rea would be
    detention in minimum security at CAMH. There, while being held at an equivalent
    level of security, he would be closer to members of his family than at MHCP.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Jones did not know how long
    the waiting list was for transfer to CAMH.  She conjectured that the wait could very well be months, but she had no
    recent experience with CAMH and transfers to the minimum secure unit of that
    hospital.  Dr. Jones commented that
    Thomas Rea should have the same privileges that were being proposed for his
    detention at CAMH during the time he remained at MHCP awaiting transfer.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A Board member asked Dr. Jones
    about the availability of privileges for Thomas Rea at MHCP while he awaited
    transfer to CAMH.  The following exchange
    took place:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.    The reason I’m asking is because would
    you be recommending if the Board orders that he be transferred to another
    hospital that he have privileges at this hospital?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.    Certainly.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.    And if the Board were simply to transfer
    him to another hospital and give him privileges at that <span class=GramE>hospital,</span> would this hospital give him the privileges that he would be entitled to at
    that other hospital? Do you follow that?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.    No.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.    Okay.  If a disposition said you are transferred to CAMH and at CAMH you have
    these five privileges, all right, and he was at the Regional.  So that’s the disposition you would have, and
    say he’s sitting here three months awaiting transfer, what privileges would you
    give him?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.    It would be helpful if the Board was
    intending to order transfer to CAMH to indicate that while he is awaiting
    transfer, he could have the following privileges at </span>MHCP.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    And
    if the Board did not put that helpful section in?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    I do
    not know how the hospital would interpret that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Okay.  All right, and based on your assessment of
    Mr. Rea’s risk at this time, I believe you said that he was eligible did you
    say at this moment accompanied passes?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    I
    believe at this time he would be suitable for grounds privileges with staff,
    yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Yes,
    accompanied by staff?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A few minutes later, the
    presiding alternate chairperson of the Board returned to the issue of interim
    privileges at MHCP while awaiting transfer to CAMH.  Dr. Jones offered to contact the person in
    charge of MHCP to determine whether interim privileges would be extended at
    MHCP to the same extent as were contemplated after transfer to CAMH.  During this exchange, counsel for Thomas Rea
    reported to the Board that the detainee wanted to be transferred to CAMH,
    irrespective of provision of equivalent interim privileges at MHCP.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After speaking to the Chief of
    the Forensic Division at MHCP, Dr. Jones reported to the Board: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[G]<span
class=SpellE>iven</span> that this is Mr. Rea’s initial disposition on his
    current NCR finding, he has no current disposition naming this hospital, giving
    him privileges at this hospital, and therefore were the Board to write an order
    transferring him to CAMH with privileges at CAMH, Dr. Brian Jones would not be
    recommending to the hospital that he get those same privileges at this hospital
    because he does not have a current disposition at this hospital on his current
    NCR finding granting him privileges at this hospital.</span></p>

    Disposition by the Board</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its disposition of May 6,
    2009, the Board ordered that Thomas Rea be detained in the minimum security
    unit at CAMH.  The person in charge of
    the hospital was given the discretion to provide a series of privileges to
    Thomas Rea.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Absent from the disposition was

lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board issued its reasons

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    of this Court decided that the MHCP had residual custodial authority over
    Thomas Rea pending his transfer to CAMH and that the person in charge of MHCP

    person in charge of CAMH would have after transfer.</span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal raises two issues.
    The first is preliminary, and relates to the application of the doctrine of <span
class=SpellE>mootness</span> to the circumstances of this case.  The second is substantive and has to do with
    whether the decision of the Board not to make provision for interim or residual
    custody and privileges at MHCP pending transfer to CAMH was unreasonable or
    reflects legal error.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    First Issue: The Doctrine of <span class=SpellE>Mootness</span> and its
    Application</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>                    <b>The Background</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When MHCP filed its notice of
    appeal from the Board’s disposition on July 7, 2009, Thomas Rea was detained at
    the Regional Forensic Services Program at MHCP.  The original Form 49 warrant issued by the judge who had found Thomas Rea
    NCRMD was spent. The disposition of the Board ordered his transfer to the
    minimum security unit of CAMH, but made no provision for interim or residual custody
    or privileges at MHCP pending that transfer.  In the result, Thomas Rea remained at MHCP, as if the original warrant
    remained controlling.  He had no
    privileges.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 23, 2009, about one
    month prior to the date scheduled for and the actual hearing of MHCP’s appeal,
    Thomas Rea was transferred to CAMH where he remains subject to the terms of the
    Board’s disposition of May 6, 2009.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>        The Positions of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>MHCP, supported by CAMH,
    advances two alternative submissions in response to the Attorney General’s
    position that the appeal is moot and ought not to be heard.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the first place, MHCP and
    CAMH say, the appeal is not moot.  There
    remains a <span class=SpellE><i>lis</i></span><i> inter <span class=SpellE>partes</span></i>.  True, the person most directly affected, Thomas
    Rea, has been admitted to CAMH in compliance with the Board disposition, thus
    the complaint about the failure to provide for interim or residual custody and
    privileges for him has vanished.  But the
    issue remains live for the hospitals, both MHCP and CAMH, in every case in
    which a transfer between hospitals occurs.  Failure to make interim or residual provisions leaves the detainee
    confined without lawful authority, exposing the host hospital to liability and
    vulnerable on <i>habeas corpus</i>.  </span></p>

    in the alternative that, even if the appeal is moot, the court should exercise
    its discretion to hear it.  <span
class=SpellE>Mootness</span> is not an absolute bar.  An appellate court has the discretion to
    decide whether it should hear an appeal that is moot.  While no finite set of criteria emerges to
    inform the exercise of discretion to hear a moot appeal, but several features
    of this appeal <span class=SpellE>favour</span> hearing.</span></p>

    out that an adversarial context exists. The issue can be well and fully argued
    on an ample evidentiary record, and is apt to arise in any case in which a
    custodial disposition may involve a transfer between hospitals with privileges
    to be provided or withheld at the discretion of the person in charge of the
    hospital.  The issue is evasive of review
    since its existence is dependent on the speed with which the ordered transfer
    is executed.  Several of the leading
    decisions under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>were moot when heard and determined by appellate courts, including the
    Supreme Court of Canada, yet they were heard and determined nonetheless.  </span></p>

    decision of the Board to say nothing on either subject was unreasonable, or
    legally wrong.</span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>        The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The doctrine of <span
class=SpellE>mootness</span> is one aspect of a general practice of courts to decline
    deciding a case that raises only a hypothetical or abstract question: see <span
class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span><i> v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1989] 1
    S.C.R. 342, at p. 353.  This general
    principle applies when the court’s decision will not, in effect, resolve some
    controversy that affects or may affect the rights of the parties: <span
class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 353.  Courts decline to decide cases in which their
    decision will have no practical effect on the rights of the parties. This
    essential ingredient, a <span class=SpellE><i>lis</i></span><i> inter <span class=SpellE>partes</span></i>,
    must exist at the commencement of the proceeding and persist when the court is
    assigned the task of reaching a decision: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 353.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The courts enforce this general
    policy in <span class=SpellE>moot</span> cases.  But the general rule is not unyielding.  A court may exercise its discretion to depart from its policy or
    practice by considering two questions:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Has the tangible and concrete

    is “yes”, should the court exercise its discretion to hear the case?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>The answer to the
    first question, whether a live controversy exists, determines the issue of <span
class=SpellE>mootness</span>.  The answer
    to the second question is only required where <span class=SpellE>mootness</span> has been established: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 353.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Several factors may induce the
    disappearance of the live controversy. The contentious issues may be of brief
    duration.  The circumstances of the
    parties may eliminate the tangible nature of a dispute. The governing statute
    or controlling legal principle may change.  An exhaustive list eludes composition: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 358.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An examination of the <span
class=SpellE>rationalia</span> underlying the general rule informs the formulation
    of guidelines for the exercise of discretion in departing from the general rule
    against hearing and determining issues that are moot <i>inter <span class=SpellE>partes</span></i>.  To the extent that a particular foundation
    upon which the rule is grounded is absent or its grip is tenuous, the reason
    for its enforcement vanishes or diminishes: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 358.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One such rationale underlying
    the rule prohibiting forensic scrutiny of moot issues is that a court’s competence
    to resolve legal disputes requires an adversarial context. An adversarial
    context encourages the parties to put their best foot forward.   Parties must frame their cases, adduce
    evidence, and advance available arguments.  However, this requirement may also be satisfied where the necessary
    adversarial relationships survive the end of a live controversy.  Collateral consequences of the outcome may
    provide the essential adversarial context: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at pp. 358-359.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A second important and broad
    rationale upon which the <span class=SpellE>mootness</span> doctrine is founded
    is the concern for judicial economy.  Judicial resources must be rationed among competing claimants. Live
    controversies, not academic <span class=SpellE>endeavours</span>, should
    attract these scarce resources. The academic debate can occur elsewhere. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But judicial economy is a two-way
    street.  Sometimes, in cases that have
    become moot, a court’s decision will have some practical effect on the rights
    of the parties, even though it will not have the effect of determining the
    underlying controversy itself: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 360.  The expenditure may also be warranted in cases in which, while the
    immediate controversy is moot, the circumstances are likely to recur but be of
    brief duration. The <span class=SpellE>mootness</span> doctrine should not be
    strictly applied that important questions that might independently evade review
    go unheard and undetermined by the court: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 360.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    public importance and their resolution is in the public interest.  In these cases, what is required is a
    delicate balancing of the economics of judicial involvement, on the one hand,
    and the social cost of legal uncertainty, on the other: <span class=SpellE><i>Borowski</i></span> at p. 361.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>        The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite the absence of a live
    controversy between Thomas Rea and the Board, I am satisfied that we should
    exercise our discretion to determine the issues raised and fully argued about
    the Board’s authority and duty to provide for interim or residual custody and
    privileges pending transfer of a detainee to another hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Disposition hearings before the
    Board are not adversarial.  As the
    definition of “party” in s. 672.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>makes clear, parties other than the prosecutor and detainee appear
    before the Board.  Their interests
    vary.  If the parties fail to present
    sufficient information to permit the Board to discharge its statutory
    obligations, it falls to the Board to seek out additional evidence or material
    to fulfill its obligation: see, <span class=SpellE><i>Winko</i></span><i> v. British
    Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 54.  The
    absence of a <span class=SpellE><i>lis</i></span> between some of several parties does not mean that an appeal by another party
    is moot.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issues raised by MHCP are
    not unique to Thomas Rea, or to MHCP or to CAMH.  Rather, issues about interim or residual
    custody are apt to arise in any disposition that involves a transfer from one
    hospital to another; especially where, as appears to be the everyday reality, a
    delay in carrying out the disposition is reasonably foreseeable as it plainly
    was here.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The detritus of the Board’s
    failure to make provision for interim or residual custody and privileges in its
    first disposition may include the creation of a gap in the authority to hold
    the detainee.  It may be arguable, for
    example, that the original Form 49 warrant of committal in this case was spent
    when the disposition was issued since the detainee had been dealt with
    according to law.  The disposition
    directs the detainee’s detention in the transfer hospital. Under what authority
    then, does the host hospital continue a <span class=GramE>detention, that</span> is no longer authorized by the original warrant?</span></p>

    here may also have a practical impact on a group of mental disorder detainees
    of whom Thomas Rea was representative, but not unique:  mental disorder detainees subject to
    custodial dispositions and hospital transfers.  It may fairly be said that any detainee who finds him or herself in
    circumstances similar to those of Thomas Rea can invoke the appellate process
    and have the issue determined while the <span class=SpellE><i>lis</i></span> remains alive.  But the issue remains live for only a short period in appellate time and
    thus is largely evasive of appellate review.  Recourse to an extraordinary remedy is scarcely a viable

    examination”: <span class=SpellE><i>Starson</i></span><i> v. Swayze</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 722, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 88; <i>R. v. Owen</i>,
    [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 33 and 34.  A decision by the Board that could reasonably
    be the subject of disagreement among Board members properly informed of the
    facts and instructed on the governing legal principles should not generally
    attract appellate intrusion: <i>Owen</i> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 33.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is common ground that the
    Board’s decision to impose a disposition that included detention in a minimum
    secure unit of a hospital with defined privileges to be extended or refused
    according to the discretion of the person in charge of the hospital was an
    appropriate disposition in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complicating factors here
    were that:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE><span lang=EN-US>i</span></span><span lang=EN-US>.      Thomas Rea sought a transfer from MHCP
    to CAMH;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.       The Board made no
    effort to acquire accurate information about when the transfer could take
    place;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iii.     The Board was
    aware that without express terms providing for interim or residual custody and
    discretionary privileges at MHCP, Thomas Rea would receive no privileges; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iv.      The clinical team
    at MHCP agreed that the discretionary privileges were appropriate for Thomas Rea
    and MHCP.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the circumstances of this
    case, especially those listed in <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 68, the
    failure of the Board to obtain concrete information about the delay in transfer
    and include express terms relating to interim custody and discretionary
    privileges was unreasonable. The disposition made was not the least onerous and
    least restrictive to the detainee and was thus legally wrong, because it meant
    that during an inevitable detention at MHCP of uncertain duration while
    awaiting transfer, the detainee would be disentitled to apply for privileges
    for which the Board itself determined he should be eligible.  An interim order of this kind would have the <span
class=GramE>added,</span> and not insignificant advantage of providing express lawful
    authority for the host hospital to hold the detainee pending transfer.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the failure of the
    Board to include in its disposition and consider in its reasons the interim or
    residual custody of the detainee and availability of privileges for him at MHCP
    was at once unreasonable and legally wrong.  The Board has the authority to include terms in its dispositions
    providing for interim or residual custody and privileges pending transfer of
    the detainee to another hospital, and should exercise that authority in
    appropriate cases such as this.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.  Because Thomas Rea has finally been transferred to CAMH, in accordance
    with the Board’s disposition, the central issue in this appeal is moot.  Despite its success here, no practical remedy
    is available for MHCP.</span></p>
