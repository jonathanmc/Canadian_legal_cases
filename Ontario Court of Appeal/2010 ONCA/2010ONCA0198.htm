    Sunview Doors Limited (“Sunview”), a supplier of custom-made doors to a
    subcontractor, Academy Doors and Windows Ltd. (“Academy”), is entitled to the
    benefit of a statutory trust pursuant to s.  8(1) of the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30 (the “Act”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 8 of the Act is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8(1)     All
    amounts,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(a) owing to a
    contractor or subcontractor, whether or not due or payable; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(b) received by a
    contractor or subcontractor,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>on
    account of the contract or subcontract price of an<i> </i>improvement constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the
    subcontractors and other persons who have supplied services or materials to the
    improvement who are owed amounts by the contractor or subcontractor. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The contractor or subcontractor is the trustee
    of the trust fund created by subsection (1) and the contractor or subcontractor
    shall not appropriate or convert any part of the fund to the contractor’s or
    subcontractor’s own use or to any use inconsistent with the trust until all
    subcontractors and other persons who supply services and materials to the
    improvement are paid all amounts related to the improvement owed to them by the
    contractor or subcontractor.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>“Improvement”
    is defined in s. 1(1) of the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“improvement” means </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(a) any alteration,
    addition or repair to, or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(b) any
    construction, erection or installation on,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>any land, and includes the demolition or removal of
    any building, structure or works or part thereof, and “improved” has a
    corresponding meaning.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS AND
    JUDICIAL HISTORY</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sunview manufactures custom sliding patio doors
    for contractors.  Academy carried on
    business as a manufacturer, supplier and installer of windows, doors and
    curtain walls in retrofitted and renovated low and high-rise buildings until it
    went out of business in October 2006.  Academy’s customers were primarily property managers and general
    contractors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sunview supplied custom-made patio doors to
    Academy.  Between September 2005 and
    October 2006, Academy gave Sunview nine purchase orders.  Sunview knew that the doors Academy ordered
    were for specific improvements because of the information provided respecting
    dimensions, colour and door opening direction.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sunview did not, however, know the location of
    the improvements where the doors were being installed.  Neither the orders placed by Academy, nor the
    corresponding invoices issued by Sunview, identified where the doors would be
    installed.  The parties arranged for
    Academy to pick up the doors from Sunview’s manufacturing facility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sunview afforded Academy $100,000 in unsecured
    credit. Mr. Di’Iorio, Sunview’s general manager, testified that he did not know
    where the custom doors were installed and did not care.  However, after a number of the orders had
    been picked up and payment had not been received, Mr. Di’Iorio began to press
    for payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two of the individual defendants, Vlasis and
    Vlasios Pappas, were directors and officers of Academy. The third co-defendant,
    Olympia O’Brien, worked for Academy and is the sister of Vlasis and the cousin
    of Vlasios. Ms. O’Brien worked for Academy, handling the company’s accounts payable,
    accounts receivable and payroll. She reconciled the company’s accounts and
    prepared cheques that reflected what the company owed.  It appears, however, that she did not have
    signing authority. At trial, Vlasis and Vlasios Pappas testified that Ms.
    O’Brien was in charge of the office.  Mr.
    Di’Iorio gave evidence that Ms. O’Brien was Sunview’s contact at Academy for
    accounts payable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Di’Iorio further testified about a telephone
    conversation with Ms. O’Brien, in June or July 2006, wherein she told him that
    Sunview would receive payment when Academy was paid on its projects.  He then asked Ms. O’Brien to identify the
    projects to which the doors had gone.  She refused to disclose that information to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During that same conversation, Mr. Di’Iorio requested
    that Ms. O’Brien fax him a copy of the cheque that she had informed him she had
    received on account of one of the projects.  She agreed to send it to him.  When the fax did not arrive, he called Ms. O’Brien back that same day.  She told him she was directed not to fax it
    to him so that he would not get the customer’s contact information. (She feared
    that Mr. Di’Iorio may contact the customer and make it aware that Sunview had
    not yet been paid.)  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also, in July 2006, Ms. O’Brien incorporated
    Magnum Windows &amp; Doors Ltd. to carry on a business very similar to that of
    Academy.  She ceased working for Academy
    in August 2006, just two months before the company went out of business.  In January 2007, she leased space for her new
    company.  Ms. O’Brien had no operational
    experience in the window and door business and did not know how to work the
    manufacturing equipment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once it became clear that Academy was not going
    to pay its outstanding debt, Sunview attempted, unsuccessfully, to resell the
    doors from the ninth order to other customers.  The amount of this ninth order was $28,785.36 and no breach of trust is
    claimed in relation to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sunview brought an action against Academy for
    breach of contract on the basis of the unpaid accounts and against the three individual
    defendants for breach of trust pursuant to the combined operation of s. 8 and s.
    13 of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 13 of the Act enables the court to
    pierce the corporate veil by making any person, “including an employee or agent
    of the corporation, who has effective control of a corporation or its relevant
    activities,” personally liable for a corporation’s breach of trust. This
    determination is a question of fact: s. 13(2). Where more than one person is
    found liable under s. 13, liability is joint and several: s. 13(3).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Academy did not defend the action. Pursuant to a
    request to admit, to which Academy did not respond, Academy was deemed to admit
    that it had been paid for Sunview’s products.  Provided that Sunview could establish that it was entitled to the
    benefit of the s. 8(1) statutory trust, the individual appellants conceded that
    they could not satisfy their onus under s. 8(2) to show that they had not
    appropriated any part of the trust fund to their own use until suppliers had
    been paid. The trial judge noted, at para. 17 of his reasons, that Academy’s
    concession “… was an appropriate concession to make in light of the evidence
    tendered at trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge allowed the claim in breach of
    contract against Academy in the full amount of $87,029.98, representing the
    value of all nine orders.  He found that
    Sunview had fulfilled its duty to mitigate by attempting, albeit
    unsuccessfully, to resell the doors from the last order that Academy never
    picked up. However, he held that Sunview could not establish that it was
    entitled to the benefit of the statutory trust in s. 8(1) of the Act. The trial
    judge’s conclusion was based on <i>Central
    Supply Co. 1972</i> <i>Ltd. v. Modern Tile
    Supply Co. </i>(2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 783 (Div. Ct.). In that case, a panel of
    the Court of Appeal sitting as the Divisional Court, held at para. 19 that, in
    order for a s. 8(1) statutory trust to arise, the claimant or supplier must
    “intend that the material sold be used for the purposes of a known and
    identified improvement”. Although Academy was a subcontractor and Sunview was a
    supplier, Sunview could not establish that, at the time it sold or supplied its
    doors to Academy, it intended that they be used for known and identified

    judge held that a nexus between the products Sunview had supplied and specific
    construction sites could not be made for two reasons.  First, the individual defendants claimed that
    they did not know where Sunview’s doors were installed.  Second, the trial judge found the defendants
    failed to make proper documentary disclosure.<a

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The defendants alleged that their
    landlord destroyed Academy’s records when he locked them out of the building
    after they went out of business.  The
    trial judge firmly rejected this explanation on thorough reasons.  Despite the trial judge’s strong condemnation
    of the defendants’ conduct, he concluded that it was not enough to satisfy the
    requirement, imposed by <i>Central Supply</i>,
    that a supplier must intend the material sold be used for the purpose of a
    known and identified improvement before a trust arises. </p>

    a s. 8(1) statutory trust had not arisen, he did not have to decide the claim
    against Ms. O’Brien.  The trial judge
    did, however, comment on the evidence relating to that claim. Academy’s general
    ledger showed that, between September 1, 2005 and August 31, 2006, the company
    paid her approximately $150,000 in excess of her regular annual salary.  In her testimony at trial, Ms. O’Brien conceded
    that she received closer to $195,000 in payments from Academy during that
    time-frame, but she claimed that the money was disbursed to repay her for
    shareholder loans she had made to Academy during her tenure there. </p>

    a $7,500 advance from Ms. O’Brien to the company.  Ms. O’Brien failed to produce any other
    documentation that supported her explanation. The trial judge observed that Ms.
    O’Brien’s denial  that she was a  trustee  belied the evidence  from Academy’s  general ledger, which showed that she had
    been paid monies that should have been used to pay suppliers such as
    Sunview.  The trial judge went on to
    state that even “if Ms. O’Brien in fact did lend a large sum of money to
    Academy, at a minimum Academy’s general ledger disclosed that in the year
    before its demise the company preferred one creditor – Ms. O’Brien – to the
    detriment of others”.  Although the trial
    judge did not make definitive findings on the issue, he noted that the evidence
    raised strong suspicions that the individual defendants had run Academy into
    the ground with the intention of opening a new business under Ms. O’Brien’s
    name, which they did in July 2006. </p>

    and, after deducting the sum of $28,785.36 on account of the ninth purchase
    order, gave judgment against the individual defendants for breach of trust in
    the amount of $58,244.62. Having regard to the evidence at trial, the
    Divisional Court held that Ms. O’Brien had “effective control” of Academy or
    its relevant activities, and that she, in addition to Vlasis and Vlasios
    Pappas, was personally liable for its breach of trust.</p>

    those in <i>Central Supply</i>, the
    Divisional Court noted that, whereas in <i>Central
    Supply</i> the putative trustee was a retailer who sold to the general public,
    in this case, Academy was a contractor focused on the retrofit and renovation
    of low and high-rise rental and condominium units.  <i>Central
    Supply </i>involved a retail situation dealing with generic products; Sunview
    dealt with custom-ordered doors.  The
    doors were not stock items and were ordered according to precise measurement
    specifications.  Moreover, while Sunview
    did not know the exact location of the improvements, this information was known
    by Academy at the time the materials were supplied.  Had Academy made documentary disclosure when
    Mr. Di’Iorio had first requested the information, Sunview would have learned
    this information as early as June or July 2006.  In giving judgment in favour of Sunview, the
    Divisional Court held that the trial judge was not<i> </i>bound by <i>Central Supply</i>.</p>

    exercised its coordinate jurisdiction to the panel in <i>Central Supply</i>, and disagreed, at para. 54 of its reasons, “that

    conclusion below is intended to resolve the conflicting jurisprudence
    concerning the interpretation of s. 8(1) of the Act and the subsidiary issue of
    whether the Divisional Court correctly held Ms. O’Brien personally liable.  Because we were asked to consider whether <i>Central Supply</i> was correctly decided, in
    accordance with the court’s usual practice, we sat as a panel of five.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would resolve the primary issue of the
    interpretation of s. 8(1), a question of law, in favour of Sunview.  The reference in s. 8(1) to the creation of a
    trust fund for the benefit of “persons who have supplied services or materials
    to <i>the</i> improvement” generally requires
    that a link be made between the materials supplied and the improvement
    (emphasis added).  However, nothing in
    the wording of the section requires that the supplier intend that the material
    be incorporated into a known and specific improvement at the time of sale or
    supply and I would not read this requirement into s. 8(1).  Provided that the supplier is able to link
    the material to the improvement for which the subcontractor was owed money or has
    been paid, the supplier will be entitled to the benefit of the s.8 statutory
    trust in the Act. Here, the link is established because of Academy’s conduct in
    deliberately frustrating Sunview’s attempts to obtain the disclosure that would
    enable it to link its products to the improvements into which they had been
    incorporated.  This interpretation best
    promotes the purpose of the section and the object of the Act.  The purpose of s. 8 is to impress money owing
    to or received by contractors or subcontractors with a statutory trust, a form
    of security, to ensure payment of suppliers.  The object of the Act is to prevent unjust enrichment of those higher up
    in the construction pyramid by ensuring that money paid for an improvement
    flows down to those at the bottom. Having regard to the purpose of s. 8 and the
    object of the Act, I would hold that Sunview is entitled to the benefit of a s.
    8(1) statutory trust.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inasmuch as I would hold that Sunview is the
    beneficiary of a s. 8(1) statutory trust, there is no issue that Academy is
    liable for breach of trust pursuant to s. 8(2). In addition, Vlasis and Vlasios
    Pappas, do not contest their liability under s. 13 in the event that Sunview is
    entitled to the benefit of a s. 8(1) trust.  Ms. O’Brien contests the finding of fact by
    the Divisional Court that she is also personally liable. In my opinion, the
    Divisional Court did not commit any palpable and overriding error in so holding.
    In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to <i>Central
    Supply</i>, the relevant court decisions in Ontario interpreted the trust
    provisions in the Act quite broadly, and trial judges explicitly rejected
    reading in any intention or knowledge requirement at the time a supplier
    entered into a contract.   The relevant
    statute at the time was the <i>Mechanics’
    Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 267 (the “MLA”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In<i> Re
    Schulz Concrete Pipe Ltd</i>. (1979), 32 C.B.R. (N.S.) 157 (Ont. S.C.), St.
    Mary’s Cement Ltd., a supplier of concrete to Schulz Concrete Pipe Ltd.,
    supplied all the concrete that Schulz used to manufacture its pipes.  Schulz went bankrupt.  It was agreed by the parties that Schulz
    “supplied its pipe to owners, contractors and subcontractors and that the money
    received by the trustee was derived from construction projects to which the
    bankrupt, [Schulz], had supplied concrete pipe”:  <i>Re
    Schultz</i>, as per Registrar Ferron, at para. 4.  Thus, all the money received was from
    construction projects.  If St. Mary’s was
    successful, it would be protected from the bankruptcy of Schulz on the basis
    that the money in the bankrupt’s estate was impressed with a trust under s. 2
    of the MLA, the predecessor to the current s. 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    of the MLA, which used the following language:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All sums received by a …
    contractor or subcontractor on account of the contract price constitute a trust
    fund in the hands of the contractor or subcontractor for the benefit of …
    persons who have supplied materials on account of the contract”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Registrar Ferron further observed, at para. 9,
    that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Those entitled to the benefit of the fund in the
    context of these proceedings are those persons who have supplied material on
    “account of the contract price”. The contract referred to must be a reference
    to the contract for the supply of pipe to either an owner, contractor or
    subcontractor, as the case may be, and it is only those persons who have
    supplied material in the fulfilment of such contracts who are beneficiaries
    under the trust section. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>He went on to
    conclude, at para. 11, that no question of knowledge or intention arose when
    considering the trust provisions of the MLA.  The supplier need not have intended his
    material be used in any specific project in order to qualify as a beneficiary
    of a trust for unpaid amounts owing to it. </p>

    definition of “materials”. </span> <span
style='line-height:200%'>Section 1(1), para. 12 of
    the 1983 Act states:</span></p>

    in s. 1(1), para. 12(i), “that becomes or <i>is
    intended to become</i>” (emphasis added), Granger J. held that it was not
    necessary that a supplier know or intend that its materials end up in a
    specific improvement at the time of supply.  He reasoned, at para. 14, that “[t]he trust provisions ... were intended
    to protect persons who supply raw materials that are subsequently incorporated
    into an improvement, whether they supply the materials directly to the
    improvement site or in bulk to the contractor working on the improvement.”<i>  </i>According
    to Granger J., the original intention of the Act was unchanged.  He went on to conclude, in para. 14 of his
    reasons, that <span style='line-height:200%'>while
    “the language of the present legislation is considerably different [from the
    MLA<i> </i>provision examined in <i>Re Schulz</i>], its reasoning is applicable

    Zoellner Windows (1982) Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1989]
    34 C.L.R. 6 (Ont. S.C.).  Maple Leaf supplied
    a subcontractor, Zoellner Ltd., with windows and other building materials,
    which Zoellner used in the manufacture of its products and supplied under
    contract directly to owners or contractors who were building homes.  When Zoellner went into receivership, it owed
    Maple Leaf $24,728.15, plus interest at 2.5 per cent a month.  Maple Leaf asserted that it was entitled to
    the benefit of a statutory trust under s. 8 of the 1983 Act respecting money
    Zoellner had received from the contractors. </p>

    39(6) of the 1983 Act, for an order that Zoellner comply with an earlier
    written request for disclosure of the identity of the persons to whom the
    products were sold, the location of the construction projects and the contract
    price of the various projects.  Zoellner
    disputed Maple Leaf’s claim on the basis that Zoellner had sold the material as
    a retailer, without regard for the purpose for which it was going to be used.  It submitted that, in order for a trust to
    arise, the material had to be used on some particular lands that were known at
    the time of sale, just as a supplier of materials is required to establish for
    a lien claim.</p>

    rejected this argument on two bases.  First, in <i>Re Schulz</i>, a
    supplier of bulk cement for use by a manufacturer of concrete pipe was held to
    be entitled to the benefit of a trust under the MLA, despite the fact that that
    supplier had no knowledge of the location of the projects in which the material
    would be used at the time the cement was supplied.  Second, the trust remedy under the Act is
    separate, distinct and independent of the right to a lien claim.</p>

    Supply”), supplied floor and wall coverings to a retailer, Modern Tile Supply
    Company Limited (“Modern Tile”), and was not paid.  The only issue at trial was whether Central
    Supply was entitled to payment from the two principals of Modern Tile pursuant
    to the trust provisions of s. 8(1) and s. 13 of the Act, which allows the
    corporate veil to be pierced.  </p>

    deliveries to Modern Tile’s store, not to any of Modern Tile’s customers.  Central Supply did not know the location in
    which its products were ultimately to be incorporated and the invoices did not
    refer to a specific work site or premises.  From time to time, Modern Tile asked Central Supply to put the name of a
    customer for whom goods were intended on the invoice, but this was only so that
    Modern Tile could keep track of the material that was supplied, and match it up
    with its customer. </p>

    defendants were dismissed on the basis that the trust provisions in Part II of
    the Act had to meet the same requirements as those  for a lien in Part III.  Under Part III of the Act, no lien
    entitlement is created if materials or services are supplied without knowledge
    of, or contact with, the improvement to which the supply is made.  <i>Re

    Supply appealed.  It appears that the
    appeal could have been dismissed simply on the basis that Modern Tile was not a
    contractor, in that it was not, as defined in s. 1(1) of the Act, “employed by
    the owner or an agent of the owner to supply services or materials”.  Furthermore, it was not a subcontractor, as
    per s. 1(1), because it was not a person “who supplies services or materials to
    the improvement under an agreement with the contractor or under the contractor
    with another subcontractor.”   However,
    the appeal was not argued on that basis.  The issue on appeal, as articulated by Abella J.A. at para. 6 of her reasons,
    was “whether moneys received by Modern Tile, from the retail sale of its
    product to members of the public, constitute[d] trust funds pursuant to the
    provisions of the Act.”  If so, the issue
    was whether the individual defendants should be personally liable for breach of
    trust. The Court dismissed Central Supply’s appeal.</p>

    any premises.”  She  also cited the definitions of “contract”,
    “contractor”, “owner”, “premises”, “subcontract” and “subcontractor” – in s.
    1(1) of the Act – when materials are supplied – at s. 1(2) of the Act – s. 7

    obtain a lien. The Court also referred to an article by Mr. McGuinness, in
    which he advocated a similar conclusion in “Trust Obligations Under the
    Construction Lien Act” (1994), 15 C.L.R. (2d) 208, at p. 229. </span></p>

    paras. 18-20, is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[18] Although liens and
    trusts represent discrete remedies under the Act, the scheme and purpose of the
    Act argue for a consistent approach between Parts II and III of the Act.  The similarity in wording between s. 8(1),
    which delineates when a trust arises under Part II, and in ss. 14 and 15, which
    outline when a lien is created under Part III also supports a consistent
    requirement in both that there be an identifiable improvement before either a
    lien or trust is established.  Under s.
    8(1) a trust arises for the benefit of those who have supplied services or
    materials to an improvement.  Similarly,
    ss. 14(1) and 15 require that before a lien arises, there must be services or
    materials supplied ‘to an improvement’…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:black'>[19] In my view, therefore, the
    Act requires that a supplier must intend that the material sold be used for the
    purposes of a known and identified improvement before a lien or trust arises. <i>Where the supplier is selling material or
    services without any regard to the purpose or site for which the material is
    destined, it is deemed to be selling on the credit of the buyer alone, without
    access to the lien or trust remedies under the Act.</i> The trust provisions of
    the Act, therefore, create a trust only for the benefit of persons who have
    supplied services or materials to the improvement, not for the benefit
    generally of persons who supply contractors. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20] The Act was not intended to apply to retailers
    who sell to members of the public in general and who have no direct connection
    to any improvement to any premises.  Any
    other interpretation renders vulnerable to a trust obligation any retail store
    which supplies materials or services to members of the public, regardless of the
    ultimate use or destination of the product.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying that principle to the facts, the Court
    held that Modern Tile was not a trustee of contract monies for the benefit of
    Central Supply.  Central Supply had
    failed to demonstrate that Modern Tile had received money on account of a
    contract for a particular improvement, and that Central Supply actually
    supplied materials to <i>that </i>improvement.  There being no nexus between the material
    supplied and a specific improvement, the Court held that the relationship
    between Central Supply and Modern Tile was too remote to justify the imposition
    of a trust.  In light of that conclusion,
    it was unnecessary for the Court to deal with whether or not the individual
    defendants were personally liable for breach of trust. </p>

    materials is improved and therefore generally increases in value.  To prevent an owner receiving a benefit
    without paying for it, s. 14 of the Act gives contractors and subcontractors,
    as well as “a person who supplies services or materials to an improvement”, a lien
    interest in the premises.  Section 21 of
    the Act further secures the lien by providing that it is “a charge upon
    holdbacks required to be retained by Part IV [Holdbacks] of the Act”.  The concept of a holdback was created to
    provide some financial protection to persons, such as suppliers, who would not
    otherwise be able to assert a direct claim against the owner in circumstances
    where the supplier had no privity of contract with the owner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The amount secured by the lien is not
    necessarily equal to the debt owed to the supplier by a contractor or
    subcontractor.  The owner of the property
    is required to do two things.  First, the
    owner must hold back a percentage of the value of the construction project,
    usually “equal to 10 percent of the price of the services or materials as they
    are actually supplied under the contract or subcontract”, until the time period
    for filing lien claims has expired:  s.
    22(1) of the Act.  Second, the owner must
    pay the holdback out in accordance with the provisions of the statute.  Provided the owner complies with its
    statutory obligations, the liability of the owner to a supplier will be limited
    to the amount of the holdback at the time the owner receives notice of the lien
    claim.  Thus, a subcontractor, who has
    not been paid by a contractor or subcontractor higher up in the construction pyramid,
    cannot demand more than the amount of the holdback from the owner, even if it
    is owed more.</p>

    trusts.  The intention of the legislature
    in creating the s. 8 trust in favour of a supplier, vis-<span lang=EN>à</span>-vis a
    contractor or subcontractor, was to give a supplier a separate statutory form
    of security for full payment out of the monies received by the contractor or
    subcontractor.  As explained by Rand J.
    in <i>Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. v.
    Empire Brass Manufacturing Co.</i>,<i> </i>[1955]
    S.C.R. 694, in relation to the then MLA, at p. 696:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Act is designed to give security to persons
    doing work or furnishing materials in making an improvement on land.  Speaking generally, the earlier sections give
    to such persons a lien on the land, but that is limited to the amount of money
    owing by the owner to the contractor under the contract when notice of the lien
    is given to him...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For obvious reasons this is but a partial security;
    too often the contract price has been paid in full and the security of the land
    is gone.  It is to meet that situation
    that s. 19 has been added.  The
    contractor and sub-contractor are made trustees of the contract moneys and the
    trust continues while employees, material men or others remain unpaid.  </p>

    JJ.  In separate concurring reasons,
    Locke J. held that s. 19 of the MLA should be given its plain meaning.  Locke J. firmly noted his refusal, at p. 700,
    “to read into the section a provision that the rights given may be exercised
    only by those who then have a right to a lien upon the work.”</p>

    Committee, considered by the Divisional Court in <i>Central Supply</i>, advised the then Attorney General, the Honourable
    Roy McMurtry, on the proposed <i>Construction
    Lien Act</i>, which was enacted in 1983.  The Committee considered the existing MLA and a Draft Act before making
    recommendations for modifying the Draft Act on a section by section basis.  Section 8(1) of the current Act uses the
    exact wording recommended by the Committee.  The Committee’s explanation of its proposal, at p. 37, is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subsection 8(1) replaces 3(1) of the <i>Mechanics’ Lien Act</i>. It is designed
    primarily to protect those working on an improvement from the insolvency or
    bankruptcy of a contractor or subcontractor.  Where money is paid under a contract or subcontract after the contractor
    or subcontractor has gone bankrupt, the money received by the trustee
    administering the bankrupt’s estate is impressed with a trust.  The trust fund must first be used to satisfy
    the claims of the beneficiaries.  The
    trustee in bankruptcy becomes entitled to the money paid to the bankrupt
    contractor or subcontractor for the benefit of general creditors of the
    bankrupt only if there is a surplus.  </p>

    does not suggest that it intended to change the existing jurisprudence in
    relation to the former MLA.  By contrast,
    the Committee’s commentary with respect to s. 7(4) of the Act <i>does</i>.<a

    have rejected a synchronized approach to the trust and lien provisions of the
    Act.  Had it not agreed with the holding
    of Locke J., namely that the rights enshrined in the trust provision are
    capable of being exercised <i>independently</i> of whether or not a right to a lien exists, it would have said so.  Moreover, the Committee expressed no
    disagreement with <i>Canadian Bank of

    was enacted and the MLA was repealed.  Indeed,
    the focus of each section remains quite different.  Section 8 is linked to amounts owing or
    received on account of the contract price of an improvement; ss. 14 and 15 are
    linked to the interest of an owner in the premises and to the improvement
    itself.  The time when a lien and a trust
    arise is not the same nor is their expiry date.  When the wording of these provisions is considered in total context

    595 (Gen. Div.), St. Mary’s Cement supplied concrete blocks to Construc, a
    contractor, who used them in connection with a construction project on two
    adjacent lots.  Some of the invoices did
    not specify to which of the two lots the materials were delivered.  The contractor claimed he had no record of

    its contract price for a particular project, that the plaintiff supplied
    materials on that project and that Construc owes money to the plaintiff for
    those materials.  If all of these
    elements are clearly proven on the evidence, the trust provisions of s. 8 come

    it had supplied material to the project and St. Mary’s had met its initial onus
    under the Act.  The money received by
    Construc from the owners of the adjacent property was impressed with a
    trust.  The trial judge therefore

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       Sunview
    supplied materials to the projects on which Academy was a contractor;</p>

    to proper beneficiaries of the trust: see <i>St.

    a “contractor”, is easily satisfied.  Academy admitted in its pleadings that its business was to make windows
    and to install windows and doors.  Mr.
    Di’Iorio’s understanding was that Academy’s business focused on retrofitted or
    renovated buildings.  Its customers were
    property managers and general contractors. The trial judge had no hesitation in
    finding that Academy acted as a contractor. </p>

    admit.  Thus, pursuant to rule 51.03(2)
    it was deemed to admit the truth of the facts therein.  Academy was thereby deemed to have admitted
    that “Academy was paid for the custom patio doors that it ordered and picked up
    from Sunview for various construction projects”.  This admission satisfied the third element of
    the test.  The fourth element of the test
    was also satisfied.  There was no issue
    that Academy owed Sunview money for those materials.  </p>

    Sunview initially sold to Academy on credit based on its prior dealings with
    it, Sunview later attempted to discover the location where its materials had
    gone or the identity of the party with whom Academy had subcontracted.  Unlike in <i>Central

    products to the location of Academy’s improvements and the persons with who
    Academy had subcontracted. </p>

    not delivering its products to the construction sites of its customers, the
    trial judge noted two additional reasons why Sunview was unable to establish a
    nexus between its products and specific construction sites.  As I have indicated, the first was that the
    individual defendants claimed that they did not know where Sunview’s products
    were installed.  The trial judge found
    their denial entirely unpersuasive, expressing his doubt in the following
    terms, at para. 29 of his reasons: “I fully expect that at least one of the
    individual defendants knew where Sunview’s product was used, but I cannot say
    who.”  The second was Academy’s failure
    to make proper documentary disclosure.  The individual defendants testified that Academy’s landlord destroyed
    the company’s records when he locked the company out of its premises in early
    October 2006.  </p>

    had regard to the evidence as a whole.  He
    held, firstly, that the landlord gave evidence that when he attended at the
    premises after Academy’s rent cheque bounced, anything of value had been
    removed.  Secondly, the defendants put
    together an affidavit of documents in support of their counterclaim, which they
    would not have been able to do if, as they claimed, the landlord had thrown out
    all their commercial records.  Finally,
    on cross-examination, Ms. O’Brien admitted that Academy maintained ledgers for
    each construction project showing invoices and payments, ledgers for each
    supplier and ledgers recording what Academy did with the funds received from
    each customer.  Ms. O'Brien's explanation
    as to why none of those ledgers was produced was simply that she did not ask
    the bookkeeper for them.  The trial judge
    found that this answer showed a complete and utter disregard by Ms. O'Brien of
    her obligation to produce relevant documents pursuant to Rule 76.03.  He held that those other ledgers should have
    been produced.  The trial judge’s credibility
    findings disclose no palpable or overriding error and are entitled to
    deference. </p>

    this statutory protection “avoids the problem of allocating the total supply of
    services or materials generally to each of the individual buildings in a

    ensure payment of suppliers to the construction industry.  In this case, Academy’s conduct makes it impossible

    subcontracts for different projects.  Yet, to deny Sunview payment would frustrate the object of the Act and
    deny it a meaningful remedy.  I see no

    benefit of the trust fund created by payments to Academy. No other beneficiary
    under the Act is prejudiced by recognition of a statutory trust in favour of
    Sunview. </p>

    the evidence in this regard.  Although
    the trial judge stated, at para. 38 of his reasons, that Ms. O’Brien “did not
    have signing authority”, he made the following observations about Ms. O’Brien’s
    role at Academy:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he evidence clearly showed that Ms. O’Brien was
    actively involved in the accounting side of Academy’s operations.  She handled the company’s accounts payable,
    accounts receivable and payroll but she did not have signing authority.
    Although she attempted to portray herself as playing second fiddle to the
    bookkeeper who came in weekly, Vlasios Pappas testified that he relied on Ms.
    O’Brien to reconcile the company’s accounts and to prepare cheques that
    reflected what was properly owing by the company. Vlasis Pappas testified that
    he assumed that if his sister made up a cheque, there must have been enough

    came within s. 13(1)(b) of the Act. That is, she was “an employee or agent of
    the corporation, who has effective control of a corporation or its relevant

    during their telephone conversation in June or July 2006, that he would be paid
    as soon as Academy received some cheques from the projects in that they had
    installed the doors.  The evidence of her
    active role in the company together with the evidence that she was able to have
    Academy pay her between $150,000 and $195,000 in excess of her salary over a
    short period of time, when the general ledger recorded that she was only owed
    $7,500, indicates that she had effective control over the company or its

    trust fund, usually comprised of money used for financing the improvement.  The Committee states that the provision
    reverses existing case law and specifically cites the former Supreme Court of
    Ontario’s decision in <i>Bre-Aar Excavating

    subject to a trust. The Committee’s explanation, at p. 37, is as follows: </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Clause A clarifies the time at which the trust
    arises.  It adopts the rule laid down by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Minneapolis

    taken in some earlier cases.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'>The rule, articulated by

'>[5]</span></span></span></a> Payment under s. 8 is governed by ss. 10 and 85 of the Act. Section 10 states
    that, subject to holdbacks, the payment to a supplier discharges the trustee’s
    obligations to all the beneficiaries of the trust, to the extent of the
    payment.  Ordinarily, a trustee is
    required to distribute trust monies rateably among all the beneficiaries.
    Section 10 alters this. During the course of construction, the trustee is
    permitted to discriminate between various suppliers who are beneficiaries. Upon
    insolvency, however, s. 85 of the Act governs priorities for the payment of the
    trust fund. It states:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    a payer becomes insolvent, the trust fund of which that payer is trustee shall
    be distributed so that priority over all others is given to a beneficiary of
    that trust who has proved a lien and a beneficiary of a trust created section 8
    that is derived from that trust, who has proved a lien.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Priority
    in the distribution of trust funds among those who have proved liens shall be
    in accordance with the respective priorities of their liens as set out in this
    Part.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining trust funds shall be distributed among the beneficiaries of that
    trust and the beneficiaries of trusts created by section 8 that are derived
    from that trust, whose liens have not been proved, in accordance with the
    respective priorities to which those liens would have been entitled as set out
    in this Part, had those liens been proved.    </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'>The section confirms, that
    although the right to a lien has not been proved, a supplier may still be a
    beneficiary of a s. 8 trust.</p>
