  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s defence to all of the charges, except the assault on
    W.W. with a hammer, was that the complainants had willingly consented to the
    activities.  On the charge of assault with a hammer, the respondent contended
    that he had struck W.W. with the hammer when he and she were working on a
    project and he slipped, lost his balance and accidentally hit her with the
    hammer he had in his hand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was in a position of authority over the two
    complainants.  There was considerable evidence that the complainants submitted
    to the assaultive behaviour, and in the case of W.W., to repeated sexual
    intercourse, because of the exercise of that authority over them by the
    respondent.  W.W. also testified that she consented to sexual activity because
    she was very afraid of the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appears to have addressed the question of whether the
    Crown had proved the absence of consent beyond a reasonable doubt on the
    premise that the complainants were adults and were in a position to determine
    for themselves whether they were prepared to agree to the activities in
    question.  The complainants were young adults, although C.B. is somewhat
    intellectually challenged.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Normally, the premise relied on by the trial judge would be entirely
    appropriate.  However, in this case, there was substantial evidence that this
    was far from a normal situation involving potentially consenting adults.  There
    was evidence that the respondent ran his household in a very authoritarian
    manner, relying on supposed religious doctrine to justify his demands and his
    claim to have authority over all who were within the household.  There was evidence
    from several witnesses that the respondent acted as if he was entitled to do
    whatever he wanted to do and that the occupants of the home were expected to
    submit to the respondent’s demands.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons do not come to grips with the question of
    whether the apparent consent by the complainants was vitiated by the
    respondent’s exercise of authority over them.  In addition, the reasons do not
    address the claim by W.W. that she consented out of fear of physical violence
    on the part of the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge makes no reference to the operative provisions of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> (s. 265(3)(b) and (d).  More importantly, the trial judge never
    addresses any of the evidence that is relevant to these questions.  It is clear
    from the Crown’s submission that it was the Crown’s theory that any apparent
    consent was vitiated by either threats of force or the exercise of authority.  The
    failure to address that issue constitutes an error in law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown, in our view, has met the onus of demonstrating that but for
    the error, the result may well have been different.  The Crown is entitled to a
    new trial on the counts on which consent was the issue.  Those charges are
    sexually assaulting W.W., assaulting W.W. with a weapon (a paddle) and the two
    counts of assaulting C.B. with a weapon.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The count of assault with a weapon involving the hammer raises a
    different issue.  Consent was not in play on this charge.  The trial judge
    ultimately determined that he had a reasonable doubt whether the respondent had
    intentionally struck W.W. with the hammer.  He was not prepared to accept in
    its entirety either the description given by W.W. or the appellant.  He looked
    to other evidence to assist him in resolving the charge.  There was little
    evidence to assist the trial judge.  He did, however, consider the extent of
    the injury suffered to be relevant to his assessment of whether the Crown had
    proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent intentionally struck the
    complainant with the hammer.  He determined that the extent of the injury was
    not consistent with W.W.’s description.  That conclusion was open to him and
    did not entail an improper resort to judicial notice.  The Crown has not
    pointed to an error of law that would justify interfering with the acquittal. 
    The appeal on this charge (count 3) is dismissed.</p>
