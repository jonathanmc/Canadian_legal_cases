  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Frederick Finlay, sued the respondents
    for damages for personal injuries arising out of a car accident.  The registrar dismissed the action for delay
    in setting it down for trial.  The motion
    judge refused to set aside the registrar’s dismissal order.  Finlay asks us to set aside both the motion
    judge’s order and the registrar’s order and to reinstate the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accident occurred in October 2003; the statement of
    claim was issued in October 2004; pleadings and discoveries were completed by the
    end of September 2005.  Up to this point,
    the matter had proceeded fairly promptly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finlay’s problems began when his counsel failed to set
    the action down for trial.  In January
    2007, the registrar issued a status notice under the Rules stating that the
    action would be dismissed unless it was set down for trial within 90 days.  But a mistake occurred in the registrar’s
    office.  The status notice was not sent
    to Finlay or his counsel.  On April 30,
    2007, unbeknownst to them, the registrar issued an order dismissing the action
    for delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finlay’s counsel first obtained a copy of the
    registrar’s order in mid-May 2007.  Had
    he then moved to set aside the order, his motion would undoubtedly have been
    granted.  However, the motion to set
    aside the order was brought in May 2009.  The motion judge focused on this two-year delay in refusing to grant
    relief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Finlay makes two submissions: first, he
    contends that the registrar’s failure to serve the status notice on him or his
    counsel deprived the registrar of jurisdiction to dismiss the action; second,
    he contends that the motion judge misapplied the test for setting aside a
    registrar’s order in that he adopted a “rigid” approach to the issue instead of
    a “contextual” approach that took account of all the relevant
    considerations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal on the basis of Finlay’s
    second submission.  The motion judge’s
    order was discretionary and was made as part of his duty to manage the trial
    list.  It thus attracts significant
    deference from this court.  Nonetheless,
    I would set aside the order because the motion judge did not balance all the
    material considerations, including the absence of prejudice to the respondents,
    and therefore reached an unjust result. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 48.14 deals with what occurs when – as in the case
    before us – a plaintiff has not listed an action for trial within two years
    after the filing a statement of defence.  Rule 48.14(1) provides for the delivery of a status notice<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where an action in which a statement of defence has
    been filed has not been placed on a trial list or terminated by any means
    within two years after the filing of a statement of defence, the registrar
    shall serve on the parties a status notice (Form 48C) that the action will be
    dismissed for delay unless it is set down for trial or terminated within ninety
    days after service of the notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 48.14(2) states: “A solicitor who receives a status notice shall forthwith serve a copy

    trial within 90 days of the delivery of the status notice or unless a judge has
    ordered otherwise<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The registrar shall dismiss the action for delay,
    with costs, ninety days after service of the status notice, unless, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       the action has been set down for
    trial;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a.1)    in an action under Rule 78, documents have

    has been terminated by any means; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       <span class=GramE>a</span> judge
    presiding at a status hearing has ordered otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finlay submits that the delivery of a status notice
    under rule 48.14(1) is a condition precedent to the registrar’s jurisdiction to
    dismiss the action for delay under rule 48.14(3).  As the status notice was not served on Finlay
    or his solicitor, the registrar had no jurisdiction to dismiss the action and
    his dismissal order must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was the view of rules 48.14(1) and (3) taken by
    the Divisional Court in <span class=SpellE><i>Amardi</i></span><i> v. Terrazzo, Tile &amp; Marble Trade School
    Inc.</i>, 2009 <span class=SpellE>CanLII</span> 25607.  In that case, too, a status notice was not
    sent to the solicitor for the plaintiffs.  The court held that the registrar’s failure to serve the status notice
    meant that the registrar had no jurisdiction to dismiss the action.  His dismissal order was therefore set aside:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[10] In my view, the Registrar’s failure to serve
    the solicitor of record with the Status Notice deprived the Registrar of
    jurisdiction to order the dismissal of the action.  As Master Linton stated in <span
class=SpellE>Xu</span> v. <span class=SpellE>Olde</span> <span class=SpellE>Yorke</span> Esplanade Limited, operating as <span class=SpellE>Novotel</span> Toronto
    Centre (endorsement August 7, 2008):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Because a Registrar’s order can be so serious
    it is essential that the Registrar strictly satisfy the conditions permitted
    him or her for an administrative order to issue.  One requirement is how a Notice is served.  There was a solicitor of record who was the
    person to be served.  Instead the Notice
    was sent to the party which should not have been done.  Therefore the Registrar’s order must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, I do not agree with the holding in <span
class=SpellE><i>Amardi</i></span>.  It seems to me that it harkens back to the
    distinction between nullities and irregularities that pervaded our Rules before
    1985. It does not take account of our current rule 2.01, which eliminates the
    notion of a nullity and provides that any failure to comply with the rules is a
    mere irregularity that is capable of being cured:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.01(1) A failure to comply with these rules is an
    irregularity and does not render a proceeding or a step, document or order in a
    proceeding a nullity, and the court,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       <span class=GramE>may</span> grant all
    necessary amendments or other relief, on such terms as are just, to secure the
    just determination of the real matters in dispute; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       <span class=GramE>only</span> where and
    as necessary in the interest of justice, may set aside the proceeding or a
    step, document or order in the proceeding in whole or in part.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The court shall not set aside an originating
    process on the ground that the proceeding should have been commenced by an
    originating process other that the one employed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the pre-1985 Rules, procedural missteps
    characterized as nullities were incapable of being cured.  To give but one example, if a sole proprietor
    carrying on business under a firm name started an action in the firm name, the
    action was a nullity.  The court had no
    power to amend the claim to substitute the name of the sole proprietor for the
    name of the firm, even if the defendant was not misled:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Kaltenback</i></span><i> v. Frolic
    Industries Ltd.</i>, [1948] O.R. 116 (C.A).  That case, of course, would be decided entirely differently under our
    current Rules.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By characterizing the failure to serve a status notice
    as a jurisdictional error, <span class=SpellE><i>Amardi</i></span> effectively turns the registrar’s dismissal order
    into a nullity that must be set aside.  This
    characterization runs contrary to the curative provision in rule 2.01:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Somerleigh</i></span><i> v. <span
class=SpellE>Polhill</span> </i>(2006), 209 O.A.C. 10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 2.01 reflects the general principle found in rule
    1.04(1), which guides the interpretation of all the Rules: “These rules shall
    be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive
    determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.”  Rule 1.04(1) and rule 2.01 are intended to do
    away with overly “technical” arguments about the effect of the Rules and orders
    made under them.  Instead, these
    provisions aim to ensure that the Rules and procedural orders are construed in
    a way that advances the interests of justice, and ordinarily permits the
    parties to get to the real merits of their dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looked at in this way, the registrar’s failure to serve
    a status notice on Finlay’s counsel was an irregularity.  The lack of service did not mean that the
    registrar was without jurisdiction to dismiss the action, or – in the words of
    rule 2.01 – that the dismissal order was a nullity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lack of service, however, would be an important
    consideration in deciding whether to set aside the dismissal order.  So, for example, if Finlay’s counsel had
    moved promptly after learning of the dismissal order, the interests of justice
    would demand that the order be set aside.  Conversely, to use an extreme example, if Finlay had waited ten years
    after learning of the dismissal order before moving to set it aside, I highly
    doubt that his motion could succeed.  He
    certainly could not claim lack of jurisdiction as a basis to set the order aside.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I cannot accept Finlay’s submission
    that the registrar’s order must be set aside for lack of jurisdiction.  </p>
  <h3>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should the motion judge’s order be set aside?</h3>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>October 2003 to April 2007: from the date of the
    accident to the registrar’s dismissal order</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The car accident occurred in Port Dover, Ontario.  Although the respondents dispute their
    liability for the accident, they acknowledge that their car collided with the
    car Finlay was driving after they crossed the centre line of the road.  In October 2006, after discoveries were
    completed, the respondents made an offer to settle, which Finlay rejected.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finlay’s former wife was a passenger in his car.  She has started a separate action against the
    respondents for her injuries.  The
    respondents have counterclaimed against Finlay seeking contribution for any
    damages they must pay to Finlay’s former wife.  In defending the counterclaim, Finlay is represented by a different law
    firm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2006, the two actions were ordered to be
    consolidated.  The record before us does
    not indicate why Finlay’s counsel did not then set the action down for
    trial.  However, the action begun by
    Finlay’s former wife is still outstanding.  </p>
  <h3>(b)       May
    2007 to May 2009: from discovery of the dismissal order to the motion to set it
    aside</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This time period was critical to the motion judge’s
    decision.  Finlay’s law firm did not move
    against the registrar’s dismissal order for two years.  The obvious question is why.  The record discloses that motion materials to
    set aside the order were drafted but were never served.  Then, the lawyer handling the file and the
    law clerk who prepared the motion materials left the firm.  Apparently neither told anyone about the
    registrar’s order or the draft motion materials.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the record suggests that no one in the law
    firm reviewed the departing lawyer’s file.  Even so, correspondence from the respondents’ lawyers within the
    two-year period ought to have alerted Finlay’s law firm that something needed
    to be done.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 15, 2007, the respondents’ lawyer wrote a
    letter to Finlay’s law firm stating, in part, that “[u]<span class=SpellE>nless</span> Mr. Ferro moves to set [the registrar’s] Order aside by the end of the month, I
    propose to treat that as the final disposition of this matter.”  The letter went unanswered.  On August 15, 2007, the respondents’ lawyer
    again wrote to Finlay’s law firm.  That
    letter discussed whether the consolidation order needed to be amended, but added
    in the last paragraph: “The foregoing is, of course, premature in light of the Order
    dismissing the action of Mr. Finlay”.  This letter, too, went unanswered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over a year later, on December 4, 2008, the
    respondents’ lawyer served notice on Finlay’s law firm withdrawing all previous
    offers to settle.  This notice of
    withdrawal prompted the motion to set aside the registrar’s order, though the
    motion itself was not brought for several months.</p>

    the Litigation Delay</i>: The plaintiff must adequately explain the delay in
    the progress of the litigation from the institution of the action until the
    deadline for setting the action down for trial as set out in the status notice.
    She must satisfy the court that steps were being taken to advance the
    litigation toward trial, or if such steps were not taken to explain why…. If
    either the solicitor or the client made a deliberate decision not to advance
    the litigation toward trial then the motion to set aside the dismissal will

    evidence to explain that they always intended to set the action down within the
    time limit set out in the status notice, or request a status hearing, but
    failed to do so through inadvertence. In other words the penultimate dismissal
    order was made as a result of inadvertence.</p>

    have not demonstrated any significant prejudice in presenting their case at

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his oral reasons, the motion judge recited these
    four factors.  However, he only addressed
    the first factor – he said, “I am not sure I would have too much trouble with
    that” – and the third factor, which for him was decisive:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here, the problem for me is what was done between
    the making of the dismissal order and the bringing of this motion, a delay of
    some two years.  I do not think that
    there was a deliberate decision not to advance the litigation.  I think it was, rather, more a passive
    decision to ignore it and not to review the matter properly once Mr. Morris
    left the office.  There is no explanation
    why this file was not reviewed from Mr. Morris’ leaving the firm until May of 2009.  I take it that it was a reaction to the
    withdrawal of the settlement offers and not a quick reaction at that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To me, the conduct of the Plaintiff’s counsel’s
    firm was more than a lapse or inadvertent mistake and I think it would be very
    unfortunate if this became an acceptable way of dealing with similar
    circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge determined that because Finlay could
    not satisfy the third factor his motion must fail.  In effect, on the motion judge’s approach, in
    order to set aside the registrar’s order Finlay had to satisfy each of the four
    factors.  In approaching the motion that
    way, the motion judge made the very error identified by Goudge J.A. in <span
class=SpellE><i>Scaini</i></span><i> v. Prochnicki</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d)
    179.  There, Goudge J.A. rejected as too “rigid”
    the notion that to set aside a registrar’s dismissal order, a moving party must
    satisfy each factor.  Instead he favoured
    a “contextual” approach in which the court weighs all relevant considerations
    to determine the result that is just:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[21] More importantly, I do not agree that the case
    law reviewed in <i>Reid</i>, <i>supra</i>, yields the proposition that an
    appellant must satisfy each relevant criterion in order to have the registrar’s
    order set aside. None of the cases referred to say so expressly and several
    proceed on a more contextual basis. <span class=GramE>For example, in <i>Steele v. Ottawa-Carleton (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Municipality)</i>,
    [1998] O.J. No. 3154 (Gen. Div.)</span> <span class=GramE>Master <span
class=SpellE>Beaudoin</span>, at para.</span> <span class=GramE>17,</span> described the guiding principle in deciding whether to set aside a rule 48.14
    dismissal by the registrar as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Ultimately, the Court will
    exercise its discretion upon a consideration of the relevant factors and will
    attempt to balance the interests of the parties. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[22] I agree with Master <span class=SpellE>Beaudoin</span>. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[23] In my view, a contextual approach to this
    question is to be preferred to a rigid test requiring an appellant to satisfy
    each one of a fixed set of criteria. The latter approach is not mandated by the
    jurisprudence. On the other hand, the applicable rules clearly point to the
    former. In particular, the motion to set aside the registrar’s order dismissing
    the action for delay engages rule 37.14(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) and (2).
    The latter invites the court to make the order that is just in the
    circumstances. A fixed formula like that applied by the motion judge is simply
    too inflexible to allow the court in each case to reach the just result
    contemplated by the rules. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge did not engage in this weighing
    exercise.  Indeed, he did not even
    consider the issue of prejudice, which invariably is a key consideration on a
    motion to set aside a dismissal order:  see <i>Farrar v. McMullen, </i>[1971] 1 O.R.
    709.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s failure to adopt the approach
    advocated by Goudge J.A. in <span class=SpellE><i>Scaini</i></span> justifies this court interfering with his order and
    weighing all of the relevant considerations ourselves.  After performing this exercise, it is my view
    that the just result is to set aside the registrar’s order and to reinstate the
    action.  My conclusion is based on the
    following considerations, which take account of the four factors in <i>Marché</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Up to the time of the service of the Status
    Notice, the action had proceeded without any unreasonable delay;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At least initially, Finlay’s law firm cannot be
    faulted for not responding to the Status Notice because they were not served
    with it;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the motion judge found, and contrary to what
    occurred in <i>Marché</i>, Finlay’s law firm
    did not deliberately decide not to move the litigation forward.  The failure to do so was attributable to a
    slip-up, or at worst to sloppiness, in the law office during and after the time
    the lawyer in charge of the file left;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two-year delay in moving against the
    registrar’s order was obviously undesirable, especially as Finlay’s law firm
    had been alerted to the need to take some action.  However, the two-year period is not so long that
    by itself it warranted denying relief.  Moreover, the two-year delay has to be assessed in the context of the
    timeframe preceding it – a timeframe in which the law suit proceeded reasonably
    promptly;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents do not point to any specific
    prejudice they would incur if the registrar’s order was set aside.  As Finlay points out, the respondents’ lawyer
    maintained an open file on this litigation until at least December 2008 when he
    withdrew his offers to settle.  Yet in
    their affidavit material the respondents can muster only the bald assertion
    that it will be “extremely difficult” to locate witnesses and that because of
    the delay witnesses memories will be “hampered”.  Without more, this assertion does not amount
    to a showing of prejudice.  I agree with
    Finlay that it is likely respondents’ counsel obtained witness statements
    immediately after the accident.  Furthermore,
    I expect that if one of those witnesses was no longer available or the memory
    of that witness could not be refreshed by the witness’ statement, the respondents’
    affidavit evidence on the motion would have said so.  The absence of such evidence is telling.  See <span class=SpellE><i>Chiarelli</i></span><i> v. <span
class=SpellE>Wiens</span></i> (2000), 46 O.R. (3d) 780 (C.A.); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Any hardship visited on the respondents from
    setting aside the registrar’s order is lessened because they are already
    defending the action brought by Finlay’s former wife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cumulatively, these considerations outweigh the
    two-year delay in bringing the motion and justify setting aside the registrar’s
    order.  In my view, it is in the
    interests of justice to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, although not necessary to my decision, I wish
    to comment on two other considerations relied on by the motion judge to deny
    Finlay relief.  The motion judge rested
    his decision principally on the two-year delay in moving against the registrar’s
    order, but he also referred to the possibility of a negligence claim against
    Finlay’s law firm and the “expiration of the limitation period”.  Neither consideration, in my view, is
    germane.  The motion judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I also think that the Plaintiff is not necessarily
    out any remedy and LPIC may, indeed, become involved, although I express no
    opinion, and certainly no opinion as to whose negligence would be involved as I
    do not know exactly what took place between Mr. Morris and Mr. Ferro.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In sum, two years of delay took place after the
    expiration of the limitation period.  Taking that into account and also the fact that the Defendants have some
    entitlement to rely on the finality of the registrar’s order, I think the
    motion cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A judge who refuses to set aside a dismissal order will
    naturally be concerned that the effect of the refusal will be to deprive an
    innocent party of its day in court.  To
    protect the claim of the innocent party, the judge will often raise the
    possibility of a negligence action against the party’s own lawyer.  Although perhaps understandable, I do not
    find this helpful.  Speculation about
    whether a party has a lawsuit against its own lawyer, or the potential success
    of that lawsuit, should not inform the court’s analysis of whether the
    registrar’s dismissal order ought to be set aside.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, on a motion to set aside a dismissal order,
    the court should be concerned primarily with the rights of the litigants, not
    with the conduct of their counsel.  As
    Sharpe J.A. noted in <i>Marché</i> at para.
    28, “The law will not ordinarily allow an innocent client to suffer the
    irrevocable loss of the right to proceed by reason of the inadvertence of his
    or her solicitor.”  Sharpe J.A. went on
    to recognize that the situation may be different where the lawyer’s conduct is
    not inadvertent but deliberate.  In the
    case before us, however, the conduct of Finlay’s law firm was not deliberate, which
    affords a further basis to call into question whether the motion judge’s
    decision was just:  see <span
class=SpellE><i>Chiarelli</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Wiens</span></i>; <span
class=SpellE><i>Gao</i></span><i> v. De Keyser </i>(2008), 61 C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>)
    89 (Div. Ct.) at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In refusing Finlay relief, the motion judge took into
    account that the two years of delay occurred after “the expiration of the
    limitation period”.  I do not see how the
    running of the limitation period had any relevance to the motion.  The action was started well within the
    limitation period and would be reinstated if the registrar’s order were set
    aside.  Moreover, to be relevant, any
    prejudice from the “expiry” of a limitation period would have to be caused by
    the delay.  In this case, however, to the
    extent that it can be said the limitation period “expired”, it did so in
    October 2005 while the action was ongoing.  The delay itself had no bearing on the running of the limitation
    period.  </p>
