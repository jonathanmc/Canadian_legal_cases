style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was clocked at 131 km per hour in
    an 80 km per hour zone.  The police
    officer charged her with an offence under s. 172(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  That <span class=GramE>offence,</span> commonly
    referred to as stunt driving or racing is punishable by a fine, a term of imprisonment
    or both.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent argued at trial that the offence
    with which she was charged was an absolute liability offence and that, as imprisonment
    was a possible <span class=GramE>punishment,</span> the section violated her
    constitutional rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  At trial, the Justice of the Peace interpreted
    the offence as one of strict liability, rejected the constitutional argument
    and convicted the respondent.  On appeal,
    Justice G.J. Griffin of the Ontario Court of Justice held that the offence
    charged was an absolute liability offence.  He went on to hold that, as the offence was punishable by imprisonment,
    it was contrary to s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and unconstitutional.  He acquitted the
    respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court granted leave to appeal to determine
    the constitutionality of the charge as <span class=GramE>laid</span> in this
    case.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The respondent did not take part in the
    appeal.  However, her position was fully
    and effectively advanced by Mr. Burstein, who appeared as <i>amicus</i>.  The court is
    indebted to Mr. Burstein for his submissions. </p>
  <h2>II.        THE FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 29, 2008, the respondent was driving
    westbound on Highway 7, a two-lane highway.  The speed limit was 80 km per hour.  The respondent drove up behind a large tractor trailer that was moving
    at about 90 km per hour.  The respondent
    pulled out to pass the truck and while in the eastbound lane was recorded on
    radar travelling at 131 km per hour.  She
    testified that as she attempted to pass the tractor trailer, it seemed longer
    than it had when she pulled out into the passing lane.  The respondent also testified that the truck seemed
    to pick up speed as she attempted to pass it.  The respondent indicated that she became afraid, and sped up to get
    around the truck and back into the westbound lane.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police officer who was operating the radar
    from a police car behind the respondents car testified that there was nothing
    unsafe or remarkable about her driving apart from the speed.  He clocked the respondent at between 129 km
    per hour and 131 km per hour as she passed the truck.  The respondent slowed to about 110 km per
    hour after she had passed the truck.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The officer could have charged the respondent
    with speeding.  Instead, based on the
    single radar reading of 131 km per hour, which was 51 km per hour over the
    speed limit, the officer elected to charge the respondent with stunt
    driving.  Had the respondent been clocked
    at 2 km per hour less, as she was seconds before, the charge would not have
    been available.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> does not define race, contest or stunt, but instead
    provides in s. 172(20)(c) that those words may be defined by regulation.  Ontario Regulation 455/07 (the Regulation) defines
    race and contest in s. 2 and stunt in s. 3.  The definitions are not exhaustive.  Certain exceptions to the definition of race
    and contest are found in s. 4.  Sections
    2, 3 and 4 of the Regulation are set out in full as Appendix A to these
    reasons.  </p>

    the speed limit.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 172(2) provides that persons who
    contravene s. 172(1) are liable to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more
    than $10,000.  Offenders are also liable
    to a term of imprisonment of up to six months or to both a fine and a term of
    imprisonment.  In addition to these
    sanctions, the drivers licence may be suspended for up to two years on a first

    offence under s. 172 are, however, only a part of the sanction scheme created
    by that section.  A person charged under
    s. 172 is required to surrender his or her licence to the police officer at the
    scene and is subject to an automatic seven-day administrative licence
    suspension.  The officer shall also
    impound the drivers vehicle for seven days at the cost of and risk to its
    owner:  see ss. 172(5)-(8).  The respondent was required to surrender her
    licence at the scene and her vehicle was impounded.  The validity of these sanctions is not in
    issue in this case.    </p>
  <h2>IV.      THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 172</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before turning to the constitutional argument, I
    will address a statutory interpretation argument put forward by Mr.
    Burstein.  He submits that s. 172 does
    not create the stand-alone offence of stunt driving, and that, consequently, the
    information charging the respondent with stunt driving by speeding does not
    allege an offence known to law.  Counsel
    submits that properly read s. 172 creates two offences:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Driving a motor vehicle on a highway in a race
    or contest while performing a stunt; and</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Driving a motor vehicle on a highway in a race
    or contest on a bet or wager.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this reading of the section, stunt driving, as
    defined in the Regulation by, for example, driving more than 50 km per hour
    over the speed <span class=GramE>limit,</span> must occur during a race or
    contest before driving at that speed can constitute an offence under s. 172.  Mr. Burstein observes that race and contest
    are defined in a non-exhaustive manner in s. 2 of the Regulation.  Those definitions expand the normal meaning
    of the words race or contest to include activities that involve only one
    vehicle and one driver.  Consequently, driving
    50 km per hour or more above the posted speed limit (stunt driving) could
    constitute an offence under s. 172, even if it did not occur in what would
    commonly be understood as a race or contest so long as it occurred in the
    course of a race or contest as those words are defined in s. 2 of the
    Regulation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Burstein explained how the prohibition
    created by s. 172, as he interprets it, could be applied in a fact situation like
    that presented in this case.  The Crown
    could have charged the respondent with driving a motor vehicle on a highway in
    a race or contest while performing a stunt.  The Crown could rely on the definition of stunt in s. 3(7) of the
    Regulation for one component of the offence  a stunt.  The Crown could also rely on the definition
    of race and contest set out in para. 3 of s. 2(1) of the Regulation.  That paragraph includes the following
    definition of race:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Driving a motor vehicle without due care and
    attention  by  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=GramE>driving</span> a motor vehicle at
    a rate of speed that is a marked departure from the lawful rate of speed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Burstein argues that, on a proper
    interpretation of s. 172, the respondent could only have been convicted had the
    Crown been able to prove not only that she was driving 50 km per hour or more above
    the speed limit, but also that her driving constituted a marked departure from

    both racing and stunt driving as presenting pressing and serious danger to public
    safety on the highways.  Crown counsel
    refers to several comments in Hansard both on second and third readings of the
    legislation that refer to both racing and stunt driving:  see Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <i>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</i>,

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Amicus</i> makes two arguments in response.  First,
    he submits that a review of Hansard demonstrates that street racing was the
    real concern and that almost all of the references to stunt driving were in
    combination with concerns about racing.  Second, counsel contends that the Crowns interpretation of s. 172 leads
    to an absurdity:  <i>amicus</i> observes that on the Crowns interpretation driving a motor
    vehicle on a highway on a bet or wager is a stand alone offence under s.
    172.  <i>Amicus</i> suggests the example of a person who bets another person that he or she can
    drive to a certain location without disobeying any rule of the road.  On the Crowns interpretation of s. 172, if that
    person takes the bet and drives in accordance with all the rules of the road,
    he or she has committed an offence and is liable to a large fine, a potential
    jail sentence, a suspension of his or her drivers licence, an immediate
    administrative suspension of that licence and the immediate impoundment of their
    vehicle.  <i>Amicus</i> argues that this absurd result is avoided if, for there to
    be an offence, the bet or wager must occur in the context of a race or a
    contest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The interpretation of s. 172 put forward by <i>amicus</i> was not advanced at trial or on the
    first level of appeal.  It has been accepted
    by at least one trial judge:  see <i>R. v. Luo</i>, 2008 ONCJ 478, at paras.
    45-46<span class=GramE>.  There</span> is
    arguably an absurdity flowing from the Crowns interpretation, if the words
    bet and wager are given their normal everyday meaning.  I would not, however, be prepared to accept
    that the absurdity put forward actually exists without fuller argument on the
    meaning of wager and bet.  I am also
    not sure that a prohibition against any driving that is motivated by a bet or
    wager is necessarily absurd.  Making decisions
    while driving based on a prior bet or wager rather than based on the
    circumstances encountered by the driver may well present a danger.  In any event, despite the persuasive
    arguments by Mr. Burstein, I accept the Crowns interpretation of s. 172.  I do so for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, it is beyond doubt that when the Legislature
    unanimously amended s. 172 of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> as part of the <i>Safer
    Roads for a Safer Ontario Act, 2007</i>, it intended to broaden and toughen the
    prohibition found in the former s. 172.  That
    section made no reference to stunt driving.  The inclusion of stunt driving along with the previously prohibited
    driving activities expanded the reach of the section to catch types of inherently
    dangerous driving activity that were not encompassed within the concept of racing,
    even under the expanded definition in the Regulation.  For example, para. 3(1) of the Regulation
    defines stunt to include what are commonly known as wheelies.  It is certainly arguable that wheelies are
    inherently dangerous.  However, on the
    appellants interpretation, they are prohibited only if done in the context of
    a race or contest. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The interpretation favoured by <i>amicus</i> would defeat the clear intention
    of the Legislature by shrinking the scope of the prohibition in s. 172.  Under the former provision, all racing was
    prohibited.  If <i>amicus</i> is correct, the new provision only prohibits racing that
    involves stunt driving or betting or wagering.  An interpretation that narrows the prohibition would fly in the face of
    clear legislative intent to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also accept the Crowns submission that from a
    grammatical point of view, the insertion of the comma after the word contest in
    s. 172 supports the Crowns interpretation. The placement of the comma suggests
    that the three prepositional phrases, in a race or contest, while performing
    a stunt or on a bet or wager, all modify the verb drive.  The section effectively sets out a list of
    three ways in which the offensive driving may be committed:  see <i>R.
    v. Brown</i>, 2009 ONCJ 6, at paras. 27-28; <i>R.
    v. Araujo</i>, 2008 ONCJ 507.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the two arguments advanced by the Crown
    are persuasive, the interpretative debate is put to rest in favour of the Crown
    by reference to the French version of s. 172:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=FR-CA>Nul ne doit conduire un véhicule automobile sur une
    voie publique pour y disputer une course ou un concours ou y <span class=GramE>exécuter</span> des manoeuvres périlleuses ou pour tenir un pari.</span></p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The French version makes it clear that s. 172
    sets out three ways in which the offence may be committed, one of which is
    stunt driving.  Stunt driving is defined
    in s. <span class=GramE>3  of</span> the
    Regulation and includes driving at 50 km per hour or more over the speed
    limit.  The charge as laid against the
    respondent properly alleged a violation of s. 172.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <h2>IV:  THE CONSTITUTUIONALITY OF SECTION 172</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>Counsel agree</span> that if
    the offence as charged is one of absolute liability, it is unconstitutional as
    it is potentially punishable by a term of imprisonment.  They also agree that if the offence is one of
    strict liability, it is constitutional:  see <i>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>,
    [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addressing the constitutional question, one
    must focus on the specific offence alleged.  The various definitions set out in the Regulation create many different
    ways in which the offence under s. 172 can be committed.  The different language used in the various
    definitions of race and contest and stunt could mean that some of the
    ways in which the offence created by s. 172 may be committed are properly characterized
    as absolute liability offences while others are properly characterized as strict
    liability offences.  The respondent is
    alleged to have violated s. 172 by driving at 50 km per hour or more over the
    speed limit.  By virtue of the definition
    in s. 3(7) of the Regulation, driving at that rate of speed constitutes driving
    while performing a stunt.  The
    information charged that the respondent unlawfully:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[D]id drive a motor vehicle on a highway while
    performing a stunt, to wit:  driving at a
    rate of speed that was 50 kilometres per hour or more over the posted speed
    limit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The conduct component (<i>actus reus</i>) of the offence under s. 172 as charged against the
    respondent under s. 3(7) of the Regulation consists of driving a motor vehicle
    on a highway at 50 km per hour or more over the speed limit.  There is no additional conduct
    requirement.  This same conduct also
    constitutes the offence of speeding contrary to s. 128 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  The offence committed by the respondent is,
    in essence, a speeding offence, no matter what the Legislature may choose to
    call it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court and other provincial appellate courts
    have held that the offence of speeding <i>simpliciter</i>,
    as prohibited for example by s. 128 of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, is an absolute liability offence:  see <i>R.
    v. Hickey</i> (1976), 12 O.R. (2d) 578 (Div. Ct.), revd (1976), 13 O.R. (2d)
    228 (C.A.); <i>London (City) v. Polewsky</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. xiii; <i>R. v. Harper</i> (1986), 53 C.R. (3d) 185 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R.
    v. Lemieux </i>(1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 33 (Q.C.A.); <i>R. v. Naugler </i>(1981), 49 N.S.R. (2d) 677 (C.A.).  Not surprisingly, the Crown does not ask the
    court to reconsider those authorities.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown submits, however, that there is
    nothing inherent in the act of speeding that dictates that all speed-based
    offences must be characterized as offences of absolute liability.  The Crown submits that, as was recognized in
    the dissenting judgment of Estey C.J.H.C. in the Divisional Court in <i>R. v. Hickey</i>, at pp. 582-84, the act of
    speeding can involve a wide variety of circumstances, some significantly more dangerous
    to the public than others.  The Crown contends
    that the Legislature may choose to address various forms of aggravated
    speeding by creating discrete offences which can coexist with the generic
    offence of speeding.  The Crown further
    contends that where the Legislature chooses to create specific offences
    targeting some form of aggravated speeding, the proper characterization of
    that offence as absolute, strict or perhaps even criminal in the true sense,
    must be determined using the analysis first set down in <i>R. v. Sault Ste. Marie</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept the thrust of the Crowns submissions.  The nature of the prohibited conduct, in this
    case speeding, while certainly germane to the determination of the proper
    characterization of the offence created, cannot be determinative.  To take an extreme example, if the
    Legislature were to create an offence of wilfully and intentionally driving at
    over 50 km per hour above the speed limit, I do not think that it could be
    argued that despite the <i>mens rea</i> language used by the Legislature, the offence would be one of absolute
    liability because it was a speeding based offence.  The proper categorization of speed-based
    offences as absolute, strict, or full <i>mens
    rea</i> offences will depend on the outcome of the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Sault
    Ste. Marie</i>, at pp. 1325-26, Dickson J. recognized three categories of
    offences, one requiring <i>mens rea</i>, consisting
    of a positive state of mind, a second requiring proof of the doing of a
    prohibited act and leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by showing
    he took all reasonable care to avoid committing the prohibited act (strict
    liability), and a third, offences of absolute liability where a conviction
    follows proof of the commission of the prohibited act.  Dickson J. went on at p. 1326 to declare:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Public welfare
    offences would </i>prima facie<i> be in the
    second category </i>[<i>strict liability</i>]<i>.</i>  They are not subject to the presumption of full <i>mens rea</i>.  An offence of this
    type would fall in the first category only if such words as wilfully, with
    intent, knowingly, or intentionally are contained in the statutory
    provision creating the offence.  On the
    other hand, the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted on
    those without fault applies.  Offences of
    absolute liability would be those in respect of which the Legislature has made
    it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of the proscribed act.  <i>The
    overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature, the subject matter of
    the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the precision of the
    language used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence
    falls into the third category </i>[<i>absolute
    liability</i>]<i>.</i>  [Emphasis added.] </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> is public welfare legislation designed to protect those who use
    the roads of the province.  The Act, and
    in particular Part X, Rules of the Road, creates a wide variety of offences,
    including the offence in s. 172.  Those
    offences, taken together, are designed to regulate and control conduct on the
    roads.  The offences are properly
    regarded as public welfare offences:  see <i>R. v. Kanda</i> (2008), 88 O.R. (3d) 732 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Kurtzman</i> (1991), 4 O.R. (3d)

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal judge performed the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis.  I agree with most of his analysis.  The appeal judge concluded that the overall
    regulatory pattern of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i> did not assist in classifying the offence as either strict or absolute
    liability.  I agree: see <i>Kanda</i>, at paras. 20-26<span class=GramE>.  The</span> appeal judge next concluded that
    the subject matter of the offence  speeding  suggested a classification as an
    absolute liability offence.  I

    supported a classification of the offence as one of strict liability.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree that within the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis, the availability of incarceration
    suggests strict liability.  However, in
    the post-<i>Charter</i> era, the potential for
    incarceration is much more than simply one of the factors to be considered in
    categorizing an offence.  An absolute
    liability offence that provides for incarceration as a potential penalty is unconstitutional
    and of no force and effect, subject to an argument based on s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Courts, when interpreting legislation, will presume that the Legislature
    acted within the limits of its constitutional powers and not in violation of
    the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>R. v.
    Bernshaw</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 29; <i>R. v. Rube</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 159, at p. 160; <i>R. v. Nickel City Transport (Sudbury) Ltd.</i> (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 115
    (C.A.), at p. 138, Arbour J.A.  This
    presumption does not entitle a court to rewrite legislation to avoid a finding
    of unconstitutionality.  It does dictate,
    however, that if legislation can be reasonably interpreted in a manner that
    preserves its <span class=GramE>constitutionality, that</span> interpretation must
    be preferred over one which would render the legislation unconstitutional.  Because of the presumption of
    constitutionality, it will take very clear language to create an absolute
    liability <span class=GramE>offence  that</span> is potentially punishable by incarceration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the presumption in favour of a constitutional
    interpretation means that if the offence charged against the respondent can
    reasonably be interpreted as a strict liability offence, it must be so interpreted
    even if it could also reasonably be interpreted as an absolute liability
    offence.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal judge also addressed the fourth and
    final <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> factor  the
    precision of the language used.  He
    observed that some parts of the Regulation used words suggesting an absolute
    liability classification and others used language inconsistent with such a
    classification.  He ultimately determined
    that the language used throughout the Regulation did not point clearly in the
    direction of either absolute or strict liability.  He described this factor as neutral in the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis.  I agree that the language does not clearly
    point to a categorization of the offence as either strict or absolute liability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I think it is fair to say that had the appeal
    judge based his conclusion exclusively on the factors identified in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>, he would have decided
    that s. 3(7) of the Regulation created a strict liability offence.  However, the appeal judge went on to consider
    whether, as a practical matter, a due diligence defence could be available to
    the charge.  In examining the practical availability
    of a due diligence defence as a component of the classification exercise, the
    appeal judge relied on <i>R. v. Pontes</i>,
    [1995] 3 S.C.R. 44, at paras. 27-28, where Cory J. observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There are, I believe, two methods of determining
    whether an offence is one of absolute liability.  First, as suggested in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    regard may be had to the overall regulatory pattern adopted by the legislature,
    the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty and the
    precision of the language used.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Second, the availability of a due diligence defence
    must be considered.  An absolute offence
    denies an accused the opportunity to put forward a defence of due
    diligence.  Conversely, in order for an
    offence to be one of strict liability, the defence of due diligence <u>must</u> be available. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cory J. reiterated the point at para. 32:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>By definition, a strict liability offence requires
    that the defence of due diligence be available.  Put another way, if the offence does not permit a due diligence defence,
    then it cannot be a strict liability offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In considering whether a due diligence offence
    could realistically be available to a charge of stunt driving by speeding at 50
    km per hour or more over the speed limit, the appeal judge proceeded on the
    basis that the defence could not be available to a person who knowingly or
    negligently drove over the speed limit.  The appeal judge put it this way, at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is simply not realistic to say that a person
    could reasonably advance a defence that they did not know they were speeding
    when they would have to have been travelling 50 percent above the speed
    limit.  <i>Accordingly, the person would have to admit speeding, just not at the
    extreme level of 50 percent over the limit, which would defeat a due diligence
    defence.  The defence would fail because
    it is impossible to reconcile an admission of speeding with the idea of taking
    all reasonable steps to avoid speeding at a rate of speed 50 kilometres per
    hour over the speed limit.</i>  The
    notion that a broken or malfunctioning speedometer could give rise to a
    mistaken set of facts is simply untenable.  When charged under s. 3(7), the person would have to be speeding 50 percent
    or more over the posted speed limit.  The
    point is that at a speed 50 percent or more over the posted speed limit, the
    person would have to have some knowledge that they were speeding.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Gattrell, for the Crown, submits that the
    appeal judge erred in law in relying on the approach articulated in <i>Pontes</i> as a second method, distinct from
    the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis, for
    distinguishing between absolute and strict liability offences.  He relies on the subsequent decision in <i><span lang=EN-US>Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629&#8209;4470 Québec Inc.</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,</span> [2006] 1 S.C.R.
    420, at para. 19.  I accept Mr.
    Gattrells submission.  In <i><span lang=EN-US>Lévis</span></i>, the court made it clear that
    the analysis set down in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> was <i>the</i> approach to be used in
    categorizing an offence as one of strict or absolute liability.  LeBel J., for the court, described the
    analysis in <i>Pontes</i> as an unhelpful
    refinement on the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I, of course, accept what was said about <i>Pontes</i> in <i><span lang=EN-US>Lévis</span></i>.  In my view,
    however, that does not preclude a consideration of whether the language used to
    create the offence can reasonably admit of a due diligence defence.  I think that this consideration is simply one
    way of examining the precision of the language used, one of the four factors
    identified in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>.  Language that expressly, or by clear
    implication, excludes the operation of the due diligence defence will necessarily
    compel the conclusion that the offence is one of absolute liability:  see <i>Kanda</i>,
    at para. 40.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently, while I agree with Crown counsel that
    the appeal judge should not have treated the potential availability of a due
    diligence defence as a freestanding method of categorizing the offence in
    question, I think the appeal judge was right to examine the potential
    availability of a due diligence defence as part of a consideration of the
    language used to create the offence.  Viewed
    in this way, that examination is part and parcel of the <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do, however, disagree with the appeal judges finding
    that stunt driving as defined in s. 3(7) of the Regulation could not possibly
    admit of a due diligence defence.  The
    appeal judge reached this conclusion because he believed that an accused could
    avail him- or <span class=GramE>herself</span> of a due diligence defence only
    if the accused believed he or she was not travelling over the speed limit at
    all.  With respect to the careful reasons
    of the appeal judge, I agree with the Crown (both at trial and in this court) that
    the due diligence defence is not limited to persons who believed they were not
    speeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A due diligence defence to a strict liability
    charge amounts to a claim that the defendant took all reasonable care to avoid committing
    the offence with which he or she is charged.  Where the accused contends that he or she operated under a reasonable misapprehension
    of the relevant facts, the due diligence defence takes the form of a reasonable
    mistake of fact claim.  As explained in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>, at p. 1326:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he doing of the prohibited act <i>prima facie</i> imports the <span
class=GramE>offence, leaving it open</span> to the accused to avoid liability
    by proving that he took all reasonable care.  This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in
    the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The due diligence defence relates to the doing
    of the prohibited act with which the defendant is charged and not to the
    defendants conduct in a larger sense.  The
    defendant must show he took reasonable steps to avoid committing the offence
    charged, not that he or she was acting lawfully in a broader sense:  see John Swaigen, <i>Regulatory Offences in Canada: Liability &amp; Defences</i> (Toronto: Carswell,
    1992), at pp. 98-100.  The point is well
    made in <i>Kurtzman</i>, at para. 37: The
    due diligence defence must relate to the commission of the prohibited act, <i>not</i> some broader notion of acting
    reasonably (emphasis in original).  Just
    as a due diligence defence is not made out by acting generally in a reasonable
    way, it is not necessarily lost by virtue of actions surrounding the prohibited
    act, legal or illegal, unless those actions establish that the defendant, in
    committing the prohibited act, failed to take all reasonable care.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not think that it can be said that driving
    over the speed limit, regardless of how much over the speed limit, will
    necessarily preclude a finding that an individual took all reasonable steps to
    avoid driving at 50 km per hour or more over the reasonable limit.  For example, a driver, acting reasonably, may
    be proceeding somewhat over the speed limit in the passing lane of a multi-lane
    highway.  That driver may find that he
    has no reasonable choice but to accelerate in order to avoid being hit by a
    vehicle that is approaching from behind.  If that driver were to go more than 50 km per hour over the speed limit for
    the two or three seconds needed to get around traffic so that he could pull out
    of the passing lane and out of the way of the oncoming vehicle, I think a trier
    of fact could conclude that the driver was exercising all reasonable care to
    avoid driving at 50 km per hour or more over the speed limit.  Similarly, a driver who testified that he or
    she relied on a speedometer, which indicated a rate of speed well below 50 km
    per hour over the speed limit, might succeed on a due diligence defence if
    there was evidence that the speedometer, unknown to the driver, was
    malfunctioning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In outlining the above scenarios, I do not suggest
    that the due diligence defence is limited to those or similar scenarios.  I also do not imply that the due diligence
    defence will be readily available to this charge.  As MacPherson J.A. observed in <i>Kanda</i>, at para. 31, the use of strict
    liability is a serious commitment to the enforcement of the law.  I would add that even where a due diligence
    defence is available to a charge of stunt driving contrary to s. 3(7) of the
    Regulation, a conviction for speeding will often be imposed.  Section 55 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P33, would permit, in most
    situations, a conviction on the lesser but included offence of speeding
    contrary to s. 128 of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>:  see <i>R. v. Benson</i>, 2009 ONCJ 566, at paras. 29-34.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    summary, I would interpret the offence of stunt driving by speeding as defined
    in s. 3(7) of the Regulation as creating a strict liability offence.  It is true that the prohibited conduct is identical
    to the conduct prohibited by the offence of speeding created by s. 128.  I see nothing illogical in treating one as a
    strict liability offence and the other as an absolute liability offence.  The stunt driving provision provides for the
    potential of incarceration, the speeding provision does not.  This distinction is constitutionally
    significant.  The Legislature cannot,
    absent reliance on s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    imprison without fault.  Strict liability
    sets the lowest standard of fault available.  The Legislature has chosen, through s. 172, to up the penal stakes for
    speeding at 50 km per hour or more over the speed limit by including the risk
    of incarceration.  In doing so, the Legislature
    must be taken, in the absence of clear language excluding the defence, to have
    accepted the availability of the due diligence defence.  Neither the language of s. 172 nor that of s.
    3(7) of the Regulation has that effect.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I close these reasons with an observation.  This appeal has necessarily focussed on the
    availability of a due diligence defence and the possibility of incarceration.  Neither is likely to play any role in the vast
    majority of prosecutions under s. 172 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  The
    real difference between being charged with speeding and being charged with stunt
    driving by going 50 km per hour or more over the speed limit lies in the other sanctions
    that flow from being charged with or convicted of the latter.  These include a $2,000 minimum fine, an
    immediate administrative licence suspension and an immediate seizure of the drivers
    vehicle.  No one has argued on this
    appeal that the Legislature could not simply have imposed those added sanctions
    by amending the penalty provisions referable to speeding under s. 128 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>. </p>
  <h2>V.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal judge erred in holding that stunting
    driving as defined in s. 3(7) was an absolute liability offence.  His acquittal based on that finding must be
    set aside.  Although the trial judge
    proceeded on the basis that the offence was one of strict liability, given the
    uncertainty at the time of the trial as to the availability of a due diligence
    defence and the contours of that defence if available, fairness dictates that
    the respondent should have a new trial at which she will have the opportunity
    to advance a due diligence defence if so advised.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    acquittal and order a new trial.  </p>
