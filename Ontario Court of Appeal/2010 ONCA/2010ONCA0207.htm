  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The respondent was charged with five counts of
    sexual exploitation contrary to s. 153(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (counts 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) and five counts of sexual
    assault contrary to s. 271 (counts 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10).  A judge, sitting without a jury, acquitted
    the respondent on all counts.  The Crown
    appeals the acquittals on counts 3 to 10 only.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part.  I would enter convictions on three counts of
    sexual assault and order a new trial on the remaining count of sexual
    assault.  I would dismiss the appeals and
    affirm the acquittals on the other counts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The respondent was born in 1964.  He came to Canada from Poland in 1989.  He eventually became a successful engineer
    working in the auto parts industry in Ontario.  The respondent founded an organization in 1999 that took Polish-Canadian
    boys and girls on wilderness camping trips and overseas excursions.  These trips, which were sometimes supervised
    by the respondent alone, were the primary setting for the alleged offences.  At the relevant times, the respondent was in
    his mid-30s or early 40s.  The
    complainants were all teenage girls between 15 and 18 years old.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>There were four complainants: J.P. (counts 3 and
    4); N.C. (counts 5 and 6); M.D. (counts 7 and 8); and A.F. (counts 9 and 10).
    The allegations made by J.P. are quite different than the allegations made by
    the other complainants.  The grounds of
    appeal advanced by the Crown in relation to the counts involving J.P. are also
    different from the grounds advanced on the other counts.  I will address the allegations involving J.P.
    first.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>  J.P.
    testified that she had a long-term sexual relationship with the respondent,
    whom she met during a camping trip run by another Polish scouting organization.  J.P. testified that she first had sexual
    intercourse with the respondent when she was 15 years old, at a cottage in the
    Huntsville area.  She had previously
    engaged in sexual activity short of intercourse with the respondent on a
    camping trip that he led.  According to
    J.P., she had sexual intercourse with the respondent on camping trips after the
    first occasion in Huntsville.  He would
    also pick her up near her home for regular sexual liaisons.  J.P. thought she was in love with the
    respondent.  The relationship ended when
    she was 19. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>In his testimony, the respondent acknowledged
    that he had a long-term sexual relationship with J.P.  He insisted that it began after she turned 18
    and was entirely consensual.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>It was the Crowns position on the sexual
    assault charge that although J.P. had agreed to participate in the sexual
    activity with the respondent, her agreement did not constitute an effective
    consent because it was induced by the respondents abuse of his position of
    trust and authority over J.P.  The
    defence acknowledged that the respondent was in a position of trust and
    authority over J.P., but maintained that the evidence did not support a finding
    that he had abused that position to obtain J.P.s consent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge, in deciding whether J.P.s
    consent to the sexual activity was effective, referred to s. 265(3)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  That section provides that no consent is
    given if the consent is obtained by reason of the exercise of authority.  After referring to the section, the trial
    judge went on to hold:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]here is no evidence that the <u>accused exercised
    his authority as a scout leader to coerce otherwise unwilling sexual activity
    on the part of J.P.</u>  [T]here is no suggestion that any sexual activity
    between the accused and J.P. took place in the context of the scouting
    relationship per se.  Accordingly, there
    is no evidence of one essential element of the offence, namely, a lack of
    consent on count four.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The verdict on the sexual exploitation charge
    turned on whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that J.P. was
    under eighteen when at least some of the sexual activity occurred.  Section 153(1) is inapplicable if the
    complainant was eighteen or over at the time of the alleged offence: see s.
    153(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge rejected the respondents
    testimony that J.P. was eighteen or over throughout their sexual
    relationship.  The trial judge gave
    several reasons for rejecting this evidence.  The trial judge then went on to set out several reasons for believing
    J.P.s evidence that she was fifteen when the relationship began.  He went so far as to indicate that he was
    inclined to believe J.P.s testimony.  Ultimately, however, the trial judge acquitted the respondent on the
    sexual exploitation charge:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While I certainly do not disbelieve J.P., her
    evidence standing alone does not leave me with the level of confidence required
    to convict this accused of a serious criminal offence.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While as with the other counts relating to the other
    complainants, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
    relationship started when J.P. said it did, I am not satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b) The Crowns
    Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>On the sexual assault charge, Crown counsel
    submits that the trial judge erred in law by failing to consider s. 273.1(2)(c)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> before deciding
    whether the Crown had proved the absence of consent.  The trial judge referred only to s.
    265(3)(d), a provision that addresses the meaning of consent in the context of
    the definition of all assaults, including sexual assault.  That section provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For the purposes of [the section defining assault],
    no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by
    reason of </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d)  the
    exercise of authority.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge did not refer to s. 273.1(2)(c),
    which is applicable only to allegations of sexual assault.  That section describes the circumstances in
    which no consent is obtained for the purposes of the sexual assault provisions
    and reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>No consent is obtained for the purposes of s. 271 
    where </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)  the
    accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position
    of trust, power or authority;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>I agree with Crown counsels submissions that s.
    273.1(2)(c) is broader than s. 265(3)(d).  Section 273.1(2)(c) speaks not only to the abuse of a position of
    authority but also to the misuse of a position of power or trust.  The section addresses the kinds of
    relationships in which an apparent consent to sexual activity is rendered illusory
    by the dynamics of the relationship between the accused and the complainant,
    and by the misuse of the influence vested in the accused by virtue of that
    relationship.  The term exercise of
    authority in s. 265(3)(d) suggests a coercive use of authority to overcome
    resistance to a consent.  Inducing
    consent by abusing the relationships set out in s. 273.1(2)(c) does not imply
    the same kind of coercion.  An individual
    who is in a position of trust over another may use the personal feelings and
    confidence engendered by that relationship to secure an apparent consent to
    sexual activity.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The distinction between s. 273.1(2)(c) and s.
    265(3)(d) was also addressed in <i>R. v.
    Makayak</i>, 2004 NUCJ 5 at para. 70:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal;'>Section
    273.1(2)(c) broadened the scope of criminal conduct to include breach of trust
    and power. However, the section also added the words &quot;induces the
    complainant ... by abusing a position of trust, power, or authority&quot;. Does
    this mean there has to be some form of coercion? In my view, these words remove
    the need for coercion that may be present for section 265(3)(d). It is clear
    from <i>Matheson</i> [Citation omitted.]
    that it is the exploitation of the imbalance that is the key consideration.
    Section 273.1(2)(c) was passed a number of years after the courts had struggled
    with section 265(3)(d). Parliament had the opportunity to consider the case law
    that had developed up to that point. The use of the word &quot;induces&quot;
    introduces a more subtle form of pressure that can be inferred from the
    circumstances of the exercise of the power or authority.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>See
    also M. Manning, A. W. Mewett and P. Sankoff, <i>Criminal Law</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2009) at p.

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The respondent admitted that he was in a
    position of trust and authority toward J.P. during much of their sexual
    relationship.  The trial judge also found
    as a fact that the respondent exploited that relationship.  Although the trial judge observed that there
    was no evidence that the sexual activity took place in the context of the
    scouting relationship, J.P. testified that she and the respondent engaged in
    sexual activity on many of the camping trips.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge erred in law by failing to apply
    s. 273.1(2)(c) to the facts as he found them.  Had he considered that section, he may have concluded that J.P.s apparent
    consent to the sexual activity was, as a matter of law, no consent at all.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>I have considered whether this court should
    substitute a conviction on the charge of sexual assault.  While the Crowns case was formidable, I
    cannot say that a conviction would necessarily follow from the trial judges
    factual findings.  The Crown does not
    argue the contrary.  I think the
    appropriate order is to quash the acquittal and direct a new trial on the
    sexual assault charge involving J.P.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>On the sexual exploitation charge, the Crown
    argues that the trial judge erred in law by failing to consider the entirety of
    the relevant evidence when determining whether the Crown had proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that J.P. was under eighteen years of age when some of the sexual
    activity occurred.  As set out above,
    that issue was determinative of the verdict on the sexual exploitation
    charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Crown counsel acknowledges that the trial judge
    thoroughly summarized all of the evidence.  Virtually all of his findings favoured J.P.  Crown counsel, however, focuses on the
    penultimate paragraph in the trial judges reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While I certainly do not disbelieve J.P. <u>her
    evidence standing alone</u> does not leave me with the level of confidence
    required to convict this accused of a serious criminal offence.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Crown counsel submits that the trial judge was
    wrong to look at J.P.s evidence standing alone.  She submits that there was a strong body of
    evidence supporting J.P.s contention that sexual activity occurred before she
    was eighteen.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>There was evidence supporting J.P.s testimony
    on this issue.  Indeed, the trial judge
    canvassed that evidence in the pages immediately preceding the passage quoted
    above.  The trial judges reasons should
    be read as a whole.  I interpret the
    impugned passage as an indication by the trial judge that although he strongly
    leaned toward a finding in favour of the Crown, he was ultimately not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt by J.P.s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The acquittal on the sexual exploitation charge
    ultimately turned on the trial judges assessment of the probative value of
    J.P.s evidence on the crucial issue of her age at the relevant time.  The record does not support the claim that
    the trial judge failed to consider relevant evidence, but instead indicates
    that he was not satisfied that the Crown had met its burden of proof on the
    essential elements of the offence.  I
    would dismiss the appeal from the acquittal on the charge of sexual
    exploitation involving J.P.</p>

  <h2>THE ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING THE OTHER THREE COMPLAINANTS (COUNTS 5  10) </h2>
  <h3><span style='"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>(a)<span

    at Trial</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The allegations made by the other three
    complainants involved similar accusations of improper touching by the
    respondent during overnight excursions taken under the auspices of his scouting
    organization.  There was one count of
    sexual assault and one count of sexual exploitation in respect of each
    complainant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Each of the complainants gave evidence
    describing the different events underlying  the allegations.  In addition, the
    complainants gave evidence of similar events involving the respondent that
    occurred outside of Ontario.  There was
    also a similar fact witness who was not a complainant.  I need not go into the similar fact evidence
    in any detail.  It is sufficient to
    observe that the trial judge specifically found no collusion among the
    complainants or the other witness and accepted that the evidence of each
    constituted similar fact evidence in respect of the others.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>On counts 5 and 6, N.C. testified that when she
    was about 15 years old she went on a camping trip with the respondents
    organization.  There were a number of
    young boys and girls on the trip.  At
    night, the group slept in individual sleeping bags in the bus that they used
    for transportation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge summarized N.C.s evidence
    relating to the incident in this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[S]he said that, about a half an hour after bedding
    down, the accused draped his arm around her and began to caress her stomach
    over the top of her clothing from just below her breast to just above her
    crotch area.  She said that this lasted
    about two minutes and ended when she moved away from him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>N.C. also testified about an incident involving
    the stroking of her hand by the respondent while she was lying in her sleeping
    bag.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The respondent denied touching N.C.s stomach
    area.  He also initially denied stroking
    N.C.s hand.  However, in
    cross-examination, the respondent professed to recall the latter incident and
    described the touching as inadvertent, without any sexual intention.  The trial judge ultimately rejected the
    respondents explanations and gave reasons for disbelieving him.  The trial judge accepted N.C.s description
    of how the respondent groped her stomach, chest and crotch area.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>With respect to counts 7 and 8, M.D. testified
    that when she was around 16 years old, she participated in a camping trip with
    the respondents organization.  The group
    was parked for the night in the bus.  Some of the campers were asleep.  M.D. was sitting on one side of the bus with her legs bent up towards
    her chest and her arms clasped around her legs.  The trial judge gave this summary of her evidence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The accused sat beside her, she said, and put a
    blanket over the two of them.  Once
    having done so, the accused, without saying anything to Ms. D., slipped his
    hand between her leg and her chest and began to rub her inner left thigh.  His hand then, in her words, inched towards
    [her] vagina.  He did not actually touch
    her vaginal area, however.  This incident
    lasted approximately five minutes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Crown counsel submits that the trial judge
    misapprehended M.D.s evidence.  I
    agree.  M.D. testified that the
    respondent put his hand on her vagina and left it there.  While I need not decide whether this
    misapprehension of the evidence amounts to an error in law, I do bear in mind
    the evidence actually given by M.D. - whom the trial judge specifically found
    to be credible - in deciding the appropriate remedy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The respondent denied the allegation.  The trial judge was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the incident occurred in the manner that he understood
    M.D. to have described.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>On counts 9 and 10, A.F. testified about three
    different incidents, one of which occurred in Ontario.  That incident occurred on the bus while on a
    camping trip in the Algonquin Park area.  A.F. was about 15 years old.  She
    was sleeping on the bus at night when the respondent asked her if she was
    cold.  The bus was quite warm because of
    the number of people inside.  She told
    the respondent she was not cold, but said it in a faint voice.  The respondent started caressing her stomach
    and moving his hand back and forth under her clothes.  The touching continued for some time and A.F.
    eventually fell asleep.  A.F. said she
    was too afraid to say anything.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The respondent denied that he ever took a group
    to Algonquin Park.  He also testified
    that he could not recall touching A.F.s stomach or engaging in the kind of
    activity she described except when it was necessary to avoid the onset of
    hypothermia.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge disbelieved the respondent and
    gave reasons for rejecting his evidence.  Although the trial judge had some concerns about A.F.s testimony, he
    was ultimately satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on the totality of the
    evidence that the incident occurred as she described it. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b)  The Trial Judges Reasons</span> </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>As is evident from the summary above, the trial
    judge basically believed the testimony of the complainants, N.C., M.D. and
    A.F., and disbelieved the respondents explanations.  Despite these findings, he acquitted on counts
    5 through 10.  The explanation for this
    outcome is found in the extracts from his reasons set out below:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the basis of the evidence of each complainant
    considered in conjunction with the evidence of the others by way of similar
    acts, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the <i>actus reus</i> of the offences has been made out, namely, that the
    accused touched each young woman in the fashion she described.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that
    the accused did so for a sexual purpose, namely for his own sexual
    gratification.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That said, while the touching in each case may well
    have been done with a sexual intent, the fact remains that it was not overtly
    sexual per se.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Therefore, respecting the required proof of <i>mens rea</i>, although I am satisfied on the
    balance of probabilities that the accused touched these young women for a
    sexual purpose, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he did
    so.  Accordingly, he is entitled to the
    benefit of what is, in my mind at least, a slim,</u> very slim, but residual
    doubt. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(c)  The Crowns Argument on Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>In oral argument, Crown counsel conceded that a
    reasonable doubt as to the purpose of the touching was a lawful basis for an
    acquittal on the sexual exploitation counts.  Section 153(1)(a) specifically requires that the touching be for a
    sexual purpose.  Crown counsel submits,
    however, that the trial judge erred in law by requiring the Crown to prove that
    the touching was for a sexual purpose to secure a conviction on the sexual
    assault charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Sexual assault does not require proof of an
    improper or ulterior purpose.  In <i>R. v. Chase</i> (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at
    103 (S.C.C.), the court held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Sexual assault is an assault within any one of the
    definitions of that concept in s. 244(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which is committed in circumstances of a sexual
    nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated.  <u>The test to be</u> <u>applied in
    determining whether the impugned conduct has the requisite sexual nature is an
    objective one: Viewed in the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or
    carnal context of the assault visible to a reasonable observer?</u> The part
    of the body touched, the nature of the contact, the situation in which it
    occurred, the words and gestures accompanying the act, and all other
    circumstances surrounding the conduct, including threats which may or may not
    be accompanied by force, will be relevant.  The intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent
    that this may appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in considering
    whether the conduct is sexual.  If the
    motive of the accused is sexual gratification, to the extent that this may
    appear from the evidence it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct
    is sexual.  It must be emphasized,
    however, that the existence of such a motive is simply one of many factors to
    be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the
    circumstances.  [Emphasis added,
    citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge accepted the evidence of the
    complainants concerning the incidents giving rise to the allegations.  He should have considered whether, on an
    objective view of the entirety of the circumstances revealed by that evidence,
    the respondents conduct was of a sexual nature.  The respondents purpose in touching the
    complainants was not an element of the offence, but was instead evidence that
    could be considered along with the other circumstances.  The trial judges finding of fact that the
    respondent was motivated by a sexual purpose could assist the Crown only in
    proving the allegation of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge misdirected himself as to the
    essential elements of the offence of sexual assault.  That misdirection was fundamental to the
    outcome.  The acquittals on the sexual
    assault counts must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The question now becomes whether this court
    should order a new trial or enter convictions.  The former is the usual course.  I
    am satisfied, however, that it is appropriate to enter convictions in this
    case.  On a proper application of <i>Chase</i> to the trial judges findings, the
    Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the touching occurred in
    circumstances of a sexual nature such as to compromise the sexual integrity of
    the complainants.  A new trial would
    serve no purpose on these counts:  see <i>R. v. Reddick</i> (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 257
    at 259 (S.C.C.).  </p>
