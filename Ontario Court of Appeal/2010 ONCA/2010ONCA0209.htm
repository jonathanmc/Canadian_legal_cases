style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that we are entitled to revisit the principle in <i>Kelsey</i> [[1953], 1 S.C.R. 220], we are not persuaded that this is a proper case to do
    so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant gave evidence and explained to the jury why he had
    “falsely” confessed. His explanation was not complicated and would have been
    readily understood by the jury. Both defence counsel and the trial judge
    alerted the jury to the factors arising from the evidence that affected the
    reliability of the confession. The trial judge directed the jury on two occasions
    that if they believed the appellant’s testimony that he had falsely confessed
    or if they were left in a state of reasonable doubt in this regard, they must acquit.
    He also cautioned the jury that they were not restricted to simply choosing
    whether to accept the evidence of the prosecution or the defence and the issue
    was “not which of the two versions is true, but rather on the totality of the
    evidence, viewed as a whole, has the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt
    that [the appellant] caused the death of [the deceased].”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, we are not persuaded that anything
    more was required. In so concluding, we note that the reliability of the
    appellant’s confession was the key issue before the jury and, as we have said,
    the jury had the appellant’s explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there may be cases in which the type of instruction contemplated
    by <i>Osmar </i>[(2007), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 174] would be prudent, or perhaps even
    necessary, this is not one of them. That is not to say that it would have been
    improper for the trial judge to have given such an instruction in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to the primary ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the second ground of appeal, while Crown counsel’s cross-examination
    and jury address may have been unfortunate in isolated respects, we are not
    persuaded the conduct gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. In this regard, we
    note that competent defence counsel raised no concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
