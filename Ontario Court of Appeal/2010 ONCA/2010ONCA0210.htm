  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the jury verdict, the trial judge awarded Debbie
    $297,385.31, Frederick $37,982.60, and Ashley $10,852.17.  She also awarded $1,457.96 for funeral
    expenses.  <span style='line-height:200%'>The difference between the jury’s awards and that of
    the trial judge arises out of deductions for payments already made and accrued

lang=EN-US>Background of the appeal</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Counsel for the respondents made statements to
    the jury which the appellants object to as being inflammatory and designed to
    appeal to the jury’s emotions.  Counsel
    made reference to some of the injuries sustained by Amanda, and the fact that
    soft tissue was found down the side of the truck.  The trial judge refused to provide correcting
    instructions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that her instructions were
    sufficient.  Specifically, she held that
    she had turned the jury’s attention to the relevant issues and made clear that
    compensation was to be awarded only for the losses suffered by the plaintiffs
    as a result of the accident.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The appellants submit that there were
    effectively three errors in this trial.  The first two, they say, are errors by the trial judge: first, she
    failed to provide a proper correcting instruction to the jury or order a new
    trial due to inflammatory opening and closing comments by trial counsel for the
    respondents; second, she allowed the jury to consider a loss of income
    claim.  The third error, they argue, is
    that the jury awards for care, guidance and companionship are grossly
    excessive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As I will explain, I would allow the appeal on quantum in
    part and dismiss the remaining grounds.  In
    my view, the $200,000 amount of damages awarded to Debbie Fiddler for care, guidance
    and companionship is grossly excessive and attracts appellate
    intervention.  Regarding the balance of
    the appeal, I conclude that there are no errors that would justify a new trial
    or that result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>A new trial in a civil case will only be ordered
    where the interests of justice plainly require it: <i>Arland and Arland v.
    Taylor, </i>[1955] O.R. 131 (C.A.) at 140-41.  In a jury trial, a jury charge, in combination with any recharge, must
    contain errors, non-direction or misdirection such that it would justify a new
    trial in the interests of justice or would occasion a substantial wrong or
    miscarriage of justice: <i>Brochu v. Pond</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 722 (C.A.), at para. 68.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellants argue that the cumulative errors in this case
    - failure to correct inflammatory opening and closing comments by trial counsel
    and allowing a loss of income claim - resulted in an unreasonable verdict by
    the jury such that there has been a miscarriage of justice that can only be
    remedied through setting aside the jury’s verdict and ordering a new
    trial.  In other words, they say the test
    in <i>Arland</i> has been met.  I disagree. </span></p>

    fight and not an afternoon tea.<span class=GramE>”:</span> <i>Dale v. Toronto Railway</i> (1915), 34 O.L.R. 104 (C.A.), at 108.  However, as Molloy J. wrote for the majority
    in <i>Abdallah v. Snopek</i> (2008), 89 O.R.
    (3d) 771 (Div. Ct.) at para. 1, “a jury trial is a ‘fight’ that must be
    conducted within rules designed to ensure fair play, including rules
    restricting counsel from resorting to inflammatory and irrelevant statements in
    their addresses to the jury.”  </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)   <span class=GramE>opening</span> statements:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <i>Burke v. Behan</i> (2004), 6 C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>) 207 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 7, Quinn J. set
    out some examples of what an opening statement should not include.  While not exhaustive, I believe some of his
    examples are worth repeating:</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Counsel may not assert personal opinions

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Counsel should not make any comments

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Inadmissible or irrelevant evidence may

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Counsel cannot argue his or her case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reason for the exclusion of such comments by
    counsel is rooted in the purpose of an opening statement.  As Cronk J.A. observed in <i>Brochu</i>,<i> </i>at para. 16:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… [C]omments to a jury which impede the objective
    consideration of the evidence by the jurors, and which encourage assessment
    based on emotion or irrelevant considerations, are objectionable at any
    time.  Such comments are “inflammatory”,
    in the sense that they appeal to the emotions of the jurors and invite
    prohibited reasoning.  If left unchecked,
    inflammatory comments can undermine both the appearance and the reality of
    trial fairness. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Trial judges have a wide discretion to control opening
    addresses.  Where breaches occur, the
    trial judge may caution the jury, strike the jury and conduct the trial by
    judge alone, or declare a mistrial: <i>Brochu</i>,
    at para. 24</span>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='color:black'>Generally courts are
    to be guided by the principle that clear improprieties in an opening or closing
    address by counsel are to be identified for the jury and coupled with an
    unambiguous direction that they are to be disregarded as irrelevant.  In this way, the jury will know what
    statements by counsel are wrong or inappropriate and will be left in no doubt
    about the way in which it is to approach its task: <i>Landolfi v. Fargione</i> (2006), </span>79 O.R. (3d) 767 (C.A.),<span
style='color:black'> at paras. 106-07<span class=GramE>.  This</span> need not involve an admonishment
    of counsel, although, in some cases, that may be appropriate in the exercise of
    the trial judge’s discretion.</span><span style='line-height:200%'>   </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>The impugned comments:</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The appellants contend that the respondents’
    trial counsel, in her opening remarks to the jury, erred in two specific
    ways.  First, they say that she made
    explicit reference to the tragic circumstances of the accident in a manner that
    was inflammatory.  Second, they argue
    that she misrepresented the purpose of compensatory damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>At the outset of the trial, and before the
    opening jury addresses of either counsel, the trial judge provided the jury
    with this clear instruction:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>You
    must not allow yourselves to be governed by sympathy or prejudice.  You should decide this case fairly and
    impartially on the evidence presented to you in this courtroom.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge next explained to the jury that
    the respondents’ counsel would make the first opening statement “about what she
    says the case is about”.  She then went
    on to say:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>What
    she says is not evidence and if what she says to you is not borne out by the
    evidence or is contradicted by the evidence given by the witnesses in the
    witness box, you have to erase from your minds what she says.  The sole purpose of this opening is to enable
    you to better follow the evidence as it is developed.</p>

    addresses by counsel to the jury were completed by noon on the first day of
    trial.  The afternoon was taken up with
    matters in the absence of the jury.  In
    the morning following the opening addresses and prior to hearing any evidence,
    the trial judge again reminded the jury as to its proper responsibility and
    approach:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Y]esterday I told you when counsel spoke with you
    those are their remarks.  What they said
    to you is not evidence and so you must again, pay attention to the evidence
    that you hear from the witnesses or the exhibits that are filed, not what
    counsel said to you.  That is their
    anticipation of what they hope the evidence is going to be but that is not the
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus, from the very beginning of the trial, the jurors
    were instructed that the remarks of counsel were not evidence and that their
    decision was to be based solely on the evidence.  And, as I will explain, these instructions by
    the trial judge in reminding the jury of its duty were sufficient in this case
    and no further correcting instruction was necessary. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)    Circumstances
    of the accident</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In her opening remarks, respondents’ counsel made the
    following comments:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The police reconstruction expert] … will tell you
    that Amanda’s hair was wedged in the frame where the window had been and there
    was soft tissue of Amanda down the outside of the passenger side door of the
    Volvo cab. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Green will tell you that in his opinion, the
    force of the collision was such that Amanda’s head was pushed out the smashed
    passenger window and hit hard by the slamming of the two transport trucks into
    each other. She died while seated in the transport truck. She was dead before
    her body was thrown up and out of the Volvo transport truck and caught under
    the wheels of the transport truck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We were advised that defence counsel objected to the
    opening, although there is no transcript of his submissions and no ruling by
    the trial judge that can be found in the record.  Nevertheless, 15 minutes later defence
    counsel delivered his opening address to the jury, which included the
    following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…  You will
    have an issue to determine as to whether or not Miss Fiddler’s failure to wear
    a seatbelt contributed to her death.  The
    evidence will show you that she was ejected from the vehicle and she died.  The physical evidence will show you that she
    came into contact outside of the truck and ended up, unfortunately, deceased on
    the roadway.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…  [An O.P.P.
    engineer’s evidence] will explain to you that it is impossible for the
    seatbelted individual to get outside the vehicle the way Amanda Fiddler
    did.  The O.P.P. will tell you that
    Amanda was partially ejected from the vehicle.  She was already partially outside the vehicle at the time that she came
    in contact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>On appeal – and presumably with the same
    arguments made at trial – the appellants contend that the opening by plaintiffs’
    counsel was improper in that it was inflammatory and designed to appeal to the
    jury’s emotions.  They say that the trial
    judge did not provide a correcting instruction to the jury, as requested by the
    appellants.  As I have said, beyond the
    reminder the trial judge did give, no such correcting instruction was
    necessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Read in context, <span style='line-height:200%'>the statements clearly demonstrate that counsel was
    merely setting out, as she was entitled to do, anticipated evidence that would
    contradict a finding of contributory negligence.  She correctly surmised that defence counsel
    would lead evidence of contributory negligence, arguing that Amanda had
    contributed to her own death by not wearing a seatbelt.  To counter this argument, counsel for the
    plaintiffs led evidence to demonstrate that Amanda died before being ejected
    from the vehicle.  If proven, this would
    make the question of whether Amanda was wearing a seatbelt irrelevant.  In making this argument, counsel was not
    inviting the jury to decide the case based on emotion.  Any emotional effect was a function of the
    unfortunate facts in this case and not the manner in which counsel addressed
    the jury.  </span></p>

    caused Amanda Fiddler’s body to be dismembered and violently destroyed.  What happened to her body during the
    collision was horrific and an effort was made to limit the details that the
    jury would hear.  At the same time, some
    of this evidence was necessary because it was crucial to address the issue of
    contributory negligence</span>.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge, in my view, properly exercised her
    discretion to control the opening addresses.  She addressed counsel’s concern before any evidence was called, and the
    instruction given was clear and thorough.  In all the circumstances, this was an appropriate response to remedy any
    prejudice that may have arisen from the opening statement.  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)   Purpose
    of compensatory damages</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In addition, respondents’ trial counsel is alleged to
    have misrepresented the purpose of compensatory damages in the following
    passage:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You and you alone have the power to give Debbie,
    Fred and Ashley Fiddler the treatment and access to treatment that you
    determine they require.  You and you
    alone have the power to decide what wage loss Debbie Fiddler, Amanda’s mother
    has suffered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, you and you alone will determine an amount

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The appellants contend that these statements were
    improper because they invited the jury to award damages to the plaintiffs for
    their pain and suffering instead of compensating for the losses they had
    incurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I disagree.  As I read
    this, counsel was, as a strategic matter, anticipating the obvious question in
    the jurors’ minds: Why did her clients choose to self-medicate with alcohol and
    drugs instead of attending treatment and thus mitigating their damages?<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;"Times New Roman";'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This was a live issue at trial because of the
    defence strategy of minimizing the damages suffered by emphasizing Debbie and
    Fred Fiddlers’ drug and alcohol abuse.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I read the above comments as part of Debbie and Fred Fiddlers’
    response to this defence argument. Counsel sought to emphasize that although
    the plaintiffs did struggle with alcohol and drug abuse, and although their
    family situation was often strained, the death of their daughter nonetheless
    caused them significant damages, both in lost income and care, guidance and
    companionship, for which they deserved to be compensated.  As counsel explains elsewhere in her opening,
    “[Debbie] needs counselling, she needs transportation to get to counselling and
    she needs help coping”; “Fred doesn’t want counselling.  He hasn’t been to a doctor in 30 years and
    prides himself on his manly strength. ... Fred needs help to overcome his loss
    and tremendous guilt”; and Ashley “wants counselling but she cannot afford
    it.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge determined that no prejudice arose from
    these statements.  This conclusion was
    reasonable and, in my view, does not warrant appellate interference.  This is particularly so in light of the trial
    judge’s comments, cited above, cautioning the jury not to accept statements
    from counsel for either side as evidence, but rather to take them as statements
    of what counsel hoped the evidence would demonstrate.</p>

    the merits of a case are to be excluded.  Additionally, comments which impede the objective consideration of the

    16<sup>th</sup>, 2005”.  Sprinkled
    throughout counsel’s closing address were these additional comments:</p>

    counsel’s remarks to the jury was objected to by defence counsel.  Counsel argued that the remarks were improper
    expressions of counsel’s personal views and improper appeals to emotions of the

    note that the plaintiffs’ close immediately followed that of defence counsel
    and was clearly intended to address the defence theory and strategy and references
    to it made to the jury.  The theory and
    strategy of the defence consisted of an all out attack on the character,
    intelligence and honesty of each of the claimants.  Defence counsel submitted to the jury that
    the evidence revealed that each of the respondents was variously lazy,
    deceitful, a drug user and that together they formed a dysfunctional
    family.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>Regarding Amanda’s relationship with her family,
    defence counsel submitted that the evidence revealed it to be </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>very troubled and
    strained.  Defence counsel emphasized the
    evidence that he submitted demonstrated that she was incapable of providing
    care, guidance and companionship to her parents or sister.  For example, he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She had an inability to control her temper <span
class=GramE>…  She</span> had outbursts,
    violent outbursts.  She had difficulty
    with the law.  She required the police to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Amanda] had a significant disability, attention

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Defence counsel thoroughly reviewed the evidence
    in connection with each issue the jury was to decide in detail and repeatedly
    submitted that the evidence did not support the plaintiffs’ claims.  He told the jury that the evidence in the
    trial was “clear proof that the plaintiffs’ claims that the marriage broke down
    as a result of [Amanda’s] death, have no basis in fact or what actually
    occurred”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It is in this context that I have reviewed the impugned
    comments and the trial judge’s response and remedy.  Once again, as I will explain, I am satisfied
    that in all the circumstances no miscarriage of justice occurred.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)    Counsel’s

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The belief expressed by counsel for the
    plaintiffs that “Debbie Fiddler has sustained the highest loss of care,
    guidance and companionship of any case I have ever read, or any person I have
    ever met” is problematic and contrary to the test set out by this court in <i>Brochu</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Counsel’s expression of her personal opinion and
    knowledge regarding the magnitude of Mrs. Fiddler’s loss of guidance, care and
    companionship damages was impermissible and inappropriate.  Counsel’s personal opinions, beliefs or
    feelings about the merits of a case have no place in either an opening or a
    closing jury address: <i>Brochu</i>, at
    para. 15; <i>Landolfi</i>, at para 78.  <span style='line-height:200%'>Nevertheless, the trial judge was once again alive to this
    issue.  During submissions on her jury
    instructions, she stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The other thing that I was concerned about is in
    terms of [counsel] making a comment about her personal view.  That is absolutely inappropriate in a jury
    address.  You do not make any comments
    about your personal view.  You indicated
    that this was the greatest loss that you had ever seen and I do not think there
    is room for that in a jury address.  But
    having said that, in the course of the charge, many times, I say certain things
    are not compensable and they are not to be swayed by emotion.  The issue is the loss of care, guidance and
    companionship.  I think that is made very
    clear throughout my charge.  So, I think
    that will take care of most of your concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following passage was included in the trial judge’s
    instructions to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You must discard any notions or opinions of your
    own about the law or the views which counsel may have expressed about the law
    insofar as those views contradict what I say to you concerning the law
    applicable in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial judge thus not only turned her mind to the
    issue, but gave the jury explicit instructions to disregard the impugned comment.  In my view, this was an adequate response to
    avoid any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice that may have resulted
    from the comments.  It was not necessary
    for the trial judge to go further and expressly admonish counsel.  That was for the trial judge to
    determine.  She was best placed to
    evaluate the atmosphere in the courtroom and what was needed to ensure that the
    jury understood its task and how that could best be achieved in a way that was
    fair to the parties.  Her judgment in
    this respect deserves deference in this court.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)   Inflammatory
    comments</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The appellants also object to three comments
    made by counsel for the plaintiffs that they submit were inflammatory and
    invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion and not a reasoned analysis
    of the evidence.  Specifically, counsel
    for the plaintiffs told the jury that they were there to right a wrong, noted
    that the plaintiffs had suffered a great deal of humiliation during the trial
    process, and stated that the death of a poor child was not valued any
    differently than that of a rich child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Liability was admitted in this case.  Accordingly, the jury’s only task was to
    determine the appropriate quantum of damages for the respondents’ loss of
    Amanda’s care, guidance and companionship and whether those damages should be
    reduced on account of Amanda’s alleged contributory negligence due to her
    failure to wear a seatbelt.  The
    suggestion that the jury’s task was “to right a wrong” had the potential to mischaracterize
    the nature of the jury’s duty and, in effect, improperly urge the jury to
    punish the appellants<span style='line-height:200%'>.

  <p style='

    types of losses are not compensable by our law.  Instead, what you are attempting to do is compensate these individuals
    for the loss of care, guidance and companionship they have, or will likely
    suffer by reason of Amanda’s death.  This
    assessment must be made in as objective and unemotional a manner as possible.
    You are not righting a wrong.  You are
    not compensating the parents for the death of their daughter.  You are not compensating the hurt they
    experienced.  You are in no way
    attempting to put a value on Amanda’s life. These things cannot be compensated
    in law. So, again I <span class=GramE>repeat,</span> that what you are

    evidence is required to establish a loss of income claim.  For example, in <i>MacNeil Estate v. Gillis</i> (1995), 138 N.S.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), the
    court held that <a name="HIT_19"></a><a name="ORIGHIT_19"></a><span class=hit1><span

    earning capacity.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There is no question that actuarial evidence is valuable in
    cases involving complex calculations, such as claims for future lost income or
    medical care which must be discounted for various contingencies.  Nonetheless, the jurisprudence suggests that
    there is no requirement <i>per se</i> that a
    plaintiff obtain an actuarial assessment in every such case.  Indeed, one could easily conceive of a
    situation in which the plaintiff did not have the resources to retain an
    expert, but had other persuasive documentary or testimonial evidence at their
    disposal.  As a practical matter, I agree
    with the view expressed by J. Barry in “Actuarial evidence and the role of the
    actuary in personal injury actions” (Canada Bar Association: 1989) at p.6 and
    14-15:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A practitioner should give consideration to
    retaining an actuary in cases involving personal injuries of a serious nature;
    in other words, whenever a plaintiff has suffered physical injuries where there
    has been or will likely be some fairly serious permanent impairment which will
    affect either earning capacity or will require the plaintiff to purchase
    replacement services which they ordinarily did not need before the injury.  Obviously a practitioner will have to use his
    or her own judgment vis-a-vis the seriousness of the impairment and the impact
    it will have on his or her client. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Obviously, in cases of total or near total
    impairment or incapacity, the use of actuarial evidence will be crucial.  However, in cases where the physical
    impairment is only partial, the decision of whether or not to retain an actuary
    becomes difficult.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>As with personal injury claims,
    an actuary may not be necessary in all fatal accident claims.</span>  It is my practice, however, to always retain
    an actuary in those cases in which the deceased was an income earner and
    survived by dependents. ... For other situations, a practitioner will have to
    determine on the facts whether or not an actuary is necessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus, Debbie Fiddler’s failure to provide expert
    evidence in connection with her wage loss claim is not fatal.  While it was open to Ms. Fiddler to adduce
    expert evidence, she chose to prove her loss of income without doing so and
    left it to the jury to make its own calculations.  Although it is customary that expert evidence
    is called in this regard, I can find no reason to conclude that it is a legal
    requirement to do so.  I would adopt the
    position expressed by Ferguson J. in <i>Buksa
    v. Brunskill</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3401 (S.C.J.) at para. 5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The usual instruction to the jury is to suggest
    that if it finds that there will be a future loss of income it should determine
    the average annual loss and then consider the present value and then consider
    the various contingencies.  These
    calculations are customarily explained by an expert witness but in my view the
    jury must make its own calculations whether or not there is expert evidence.</p>

    in failing to provide the jury with a range of appropriate damages.  In doing so they rely on s. 118 of the <i>CJA</i>, which states, “In an action for
    damages for personal injury, the court may give guidance to the jury on the
    amount of damages and the parties may make submissions to the jury on the
    amount of damages.”  </p>

style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The language of s. 118 is permissive rather than
    mandatory.  Indeed, s. 118 is the product
    of common law reform; the traditional rule prevented a trial judge from giving
    such guidance: See <i>Foreman v. Foster</i> (2001), 196 D.L.R. (4th) 11 (B.C.C.A.) <i>per </i>Lambert J.A. at paras. 29-76 for a detailed discussion of the traditional

    the trial judge give any particular guidance on damages; the appropriate
    instruction will depend on the circumstances and requirements of each
    individual case.  As noted by Cara L.
    Brown in <i>Damages: Estimating Pecuniary
    Loss</i>, looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2004) at p. 13-50, “In a complex
    case, it will be an error not to summarize succinctly the evidence on damages

style='line-height:200%'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In this
    case, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The position of the defendants is that the reality
    of Amanda’s learning disability and personality were such that she could not
    really provide care and guidance to her parents, however, he conceded that
    Debbie has lost the companionship of Amanda and he has submitted that an
    appropriate award for Debbie’s loss of companionship would be in the range of
    $40,000.00 to $50,000.00.  [Counsel for
    the plaintiff] has not suggested a possible range other than to say that the
    defendants’ numbers are unreasonably low.  ... If you accepted the position advanced by the defendant, then the
    numbers he suggested might very well be reasonable.  If, however, you accept the position as
    advanced by the plaintiff, then the number would be higher than that.  But again, it is up to you to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The trial judge then reviewed in some detail how
    the calculation should be undertaken.  There was nothing particularly complex about the evidence relating to
    guidance, care and companionship in this case.  Juries frequently deal with the sort of testimony given by Debbie, Fred
    and Ashley.  Accordingly, the trial judge
    was not required in this case to give any further guidance as to the
    appropriate range of damages. </p>

    in declining to set out the upper limit of this head of damages in her
    instructions to the jury, in my view it may have been helpful to do so.  The defence submissions on damages, combined
    with the judge’s instructions, established a lower limit for damages.  As will be noted below, the jury clearly
    rejected this lower limit and decided to compensate on the high end of the
    permissible range.  However, they had no
    instructions as to where this range might be, and settled on an amount that
    nearly doubled it.  Although the trial
    judge was correct in instructing the jury that it was up to them to decide the
    quantum of damages, this may have been a case where it was appropriate to
    exercise the discretion set out in s. 118 and provide some guidance as to the
    upper range of such damages, thus aiding the jury in coming to this decision.</span></p>
