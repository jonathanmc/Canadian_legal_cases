  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals from the order of Conway
    J. of the Superior Court of Justice regarding support for her daughter,
    Georgia, born as a result of her extra-marital relationship with the
    respondent.</p>
  <h2>(1)       Retiring
    Allowance</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of her appeal, the appellant argues
    that the application judge erred by finding that the sum of approximately $8.6
    million received by the respondent from his former employer was not a severance
    payment and that, consequently, it did not form part of the respondent’s income
    for the purpose of calculating on-going child support.  The appellant relies, in particular, on
    various documents authored by the respondent or his solicitors in which the
    funds in question were described as a “severance payment” or “severance package”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are several difficulties with this
    argument.  First, the power of this court
    to interfere with an application judge’s factual findings is limited.  Absent palpable and overriding error,
    appellate interference with such findings is precluded.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the application judge found that
    the respondent was not terminated by his employer but, rather, that he elected
    to voluntarily retire from his position and negotiated a retirement package
    with his employer.  This key factual
    finding, which was amply supported by the evidence, attracts considerable
    deference from this court.  We are not
    persuaded that it is tainted by palpable and overriding error so as to justify
    appellate intervention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the application judge also concluded
    that: “The evidence is equally consistent with [the respondent’s] explanation
    that he wanted to retire from the company, that he received a retiring
    allowance in appreciation for his years with the company and his contribution
    to its profitability, and that he agreed to stay on until a successor was
    found.”  As with her factual findings,
    the application judge’s appreciation of the evidence attracts great deference
    from a reviewing court.  It was open to
    the application judge to reach this conclusion on the evidence in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, we note that the challenged payment was
    negotiated by the respondent with his employer, and confirmed by written
    agreement, about seven months before he met the appellant and almost two years
    prior to the birth of their daughter.  Further, on all the evidence, the payment at issue was a one-time,
    non-recurring payment that was paid before Georgia was conceived.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, although it is true that the respondent
    and his lawyers referred to the funds in question as “severance” or a
    “severance package” in various documents from time to time, we agree with the
    application judge that this characterization of the funds is not dispositive of
    their legal nature.  There was
    considerable evidential support for the application judge’s conclusion that the
    funds did not constitute, and were not intended by the respondent and his
    employer to constitute, replacement income.  Consequently, the application judge was fully justified in allocating
    the funds at issue to the respondent’s income in the year of receipt, rather than
    future years.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Long
    Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) Payment</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also challenges the application
    judge’s treatment of the LTIP payment made to the respondent by his employer in
    November 2003.  The evidence at trial was
    that on execution of the retirement agreement between the respondent and his
    employer, the respondent’s unvested options were cancelled in accordance with
    the company’s usual practice on the departure of a senior executive.  The agreed LTIP payment represented the value
    of the respondent’s vested options.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In these circumstances, the application judge
    correctly recognized that s. 13 of Schedule III of the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, O. Reg. 391/97 <span class=GramE>was</span> engaged.  That provision requires that
    the profits on the exercise of a stock option are to be brought into the
    recipient’s income in the year of exercise.  This is dispositive of the income allocation issue relating to the LTIP
    payment.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Impugned
    Property Transfers</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, the appellant argued that certain
    property transfers made by the respondent to his wife were designed to divert
    income which would affect the level of child support to be paid by the
    respondent under the Guidelines.  She
    therefore sought to impute income to the respondent in respect of the
    transferred funds and other assets. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge rejected this claim on two
    grounds.  First, some of the impugned
    property transfers were carried out before the respondent learned that the
    appellant was pregnant.  Thus, these
    transfers could not have been made for the improper purpose alleged by the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, with respect to the remaining transfers,
    the application judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that they were <span
class=GramE>effected</span> to meet the demands of his wife after she learned
    of his relationship with the appellant and of the appellant’s pregnancy.  The application judge concluded that the
    respondent had provided a reasonable explanation for the impugned
    transfers.  This finding, as well, was
    open to the application judge on the evidence.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Other
    Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s remaining grounds of appeal may
    be dealt with summarily.  She maintains
    that the application judge erred by failing to “gross up” the respondent’s
    income to take account of the differential in the applicable top marginal tax
    rates between Canada and the United Kingdom, where the respondent now lives.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  The fact of a differential was undisputed.  However, the application judge found that no
    evidence had been adduced by the appellant regarding the difference in the <i>effective</i> tax rates between the two
    countries.  Section 19(1)(c) of the
    Guidelines permits the imputation of income to a payor, as the court considers
    appropriate, if the payor “lives in a country that has <i>effective</i> rates of income tax that are significantly lower than
    those in Canada” (emphasis added).  Thus,
    evidence on the differential in the effective tax rates between Canada and the
    United Kingdom was required to trigger s.&nbsp;19(1)(c).  In the absence of such evidence, it was not
    incumbent on the application judge, nor, in our view, would it have been
    appropriate for her to conduct the applicable calculations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant further argues that the
    application judge erred by declining to direct that the respondent contribute
    to private school expenses for Georgia, as an extraordinary expense under s. 7
    of the Guidelines.  We would not accede
    to this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the time of trial, Georgia was three years of
    age.  The application judge was not
    persuaded that private school was “necessary in relation to Georgia’s best
    interests” at the time of the application.  She therefore declined to make the requested s. 7 order.  However, she also ruled that this did not
    preclude the appellant from seeking contribution for private school expenses at
    a later date on proper evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the record before her, we see no error in the
    application judge’s approach to this issue.  We recognize and agree with the appellant that Georgia’s proper
    education is a matter of considerable importance.  Based on the application judge’s decision, it
    is open to the appellant, if so advised, to seek an appropriate sharing of
    private school expenses under s. 7 of the Guidelines on application to the
    Superior Court of Justice, supported by proper evidential materials.</p>
  <h2>(5)       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to his costs of
    the appeal, fixed in the amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
