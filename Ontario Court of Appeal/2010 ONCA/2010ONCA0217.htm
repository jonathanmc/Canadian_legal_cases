  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants own two townhouse units in the
    condominium operated by the respondent, Nipissing Condominium Corporation No. 4
    (“NPCC No. 4”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NPCC No. 4 brought an application against the
    appellants pursuant to, among other things, s. 134(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, <i>1998</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 19 (the “<i>Condominium
    Act 1998”)</i>.  The primary reason for
    bringing the application was to enforce the terms of the Declaration and By-law
    that had been registered on title many years ago, which stipulated that the
    units were to be occupied as a “one family residence”.  Part I(1) of the Declaration defined “family”
    as “a social unit consisting of parent(s) and their children, whether natural
    or adopted and includes other relatives if living with the primary group.”  NPCC No. 4 implemented the Declaration by allowing
    each unit to be occupied only by members of a family who are related to each other.  Beginning in 2005, problems had arisen
    because a number of the units had been rented to multiple unrelated tenants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NPCC No. 4 was successful on the application.  It obtained a judgment in which a number of
    declarations were made, including that the appellants were in breach of the <i>Condominium Act 1998</i>, that the
    condominium units can be occupied only as a one family residence as defined in
    the Declaration, and that occupation by multiple unrelated tenants is a breach
    of the Declaration and By-law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal, asking this court to set aside
    the judgment below.  The court found it
    unnecessary to call on the respondent.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ primary argument on appeal is that it
    is unreasonable to restrict occupancy in this day and age on the basis of
    whether the occupants are related to one another.  Counsel relies primarily on the reasoning of
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Bell v.
    The Queen</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 212.  With
    respect, <i>Bell</i> is of no assistance to
    the appellants because it is a land use planning case.  The principles that apply to land use
    planning are different than those that apply when considering the validity of
    a  condominium’s declaration and by-laws.  Section 7(4)(b) of the <i>Condominium Act 1998 </i>permits declarations to contain conditions or restrictions
    on the occupation and use of units.  Owners of units, among others, must comply with the <i>Condominium Act 1998</i>, declaration and by-laws:  see s. 119(1) of the <i>Condominium Act 1998</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the application judge correctly concluded
    that the only issue on the application was whether the occupancy provision
    violated the <i>Human Rights Code</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19.  Further, he
    correctly decided that the occupancy provision does not infringe any ground
    listed in s. 2(1) of the <i>Human Rights
    Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence below consisted solely of that provided by
    the NPCC No. 4.  The appellants filed no
    responding material.  The evidence showed
    that the appellants rented their units to students who were not living together
    because of some familial connection.  It
    also showed that when the appellants purchased the units, the status
    certificate showed that they could not be leased to multiple tenants but only
    to single families.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the application judge’s exercise of
    discretion under s. 134 of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i>.  Paragraph 29 of the reasons of
    the application judge is a succinct summary of his reasoning in that regard:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>NPCC No. 4 is a condominium project geared toward
    families living in their individual units in the project and sharing communal
    responsibility for the common areas.  The
    peaceful use and enjoyment of each family of its own unit ought not to be
    breached by the actions of any individual who does not conform to the
    contractual obligation entered into in accordance with the Declaration when the
    condominium was purchased.  The condominium
    project is unique in that individual families have their privacy protected
    within their own units but at the same time are required to live by rules of
    the community as they pertain to the common areas used by all members of the
    individual condominium project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the
    respondent fixed at $7500, all inclusive.</p>
