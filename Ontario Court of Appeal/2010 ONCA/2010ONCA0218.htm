  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal and cross-appeal challenge the child and
    spousal support awarded by the trial judge, as well as his disposition of
    costs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ordered the respondent wife, Carol
    McNeil, to pay child support to the appellant husband, Daniel Cassidy, for the
    support of their then 15-year-old daughter, Louise, in accordance with the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, O. Reg. 391/<span
class=GramE>97  (</span><i>Guidelines</i>).  Based on his finding that the wife earned
    $85,000 per annum, he fixed the amount of support at $759 monthly, beginning in
    January 2008.  In addition, the trial
    judge ordered the parties to share future special or extraordinary expenses
    under s. 7 of the <i>Guidelines </i>in
    proportion to their respective incomes.  The
    husband was apparently earning approximately $137,000 at the time of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed the husband’s claim for retrospective
    periodic and s. 7 child support, including his claim for support for the
    parties’ other two children, Jeffery and Thomas, both of whom had completed
    their undergraduate studies by the time of trial.  The trial judge also dismissed the wife’s
    claim for retrospective spousal support.  However, he ordered the husband to pay the wife prospective spousal
    support of $1,200 monthly for a limited term of five years.  After later submissions on costs, the trial
    judge ordered the husband to pay the wife’s costs fixed at $24,590.35.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the husband seeks to set aside the order of
    the trial judge and to substitute an order awarding him child support
    retrospective to the parties’ 2003 separation and dismissing the wife’s claim
    for spousal support.  He also seeks an
    order overturning the trial judge’s costs award and awarding him costs of the
    trial.  The wife cross-appeals seeking to
    increase the amount of spousal support from $1,200 to $2,000 monthly and its
    duration to 12 years post-trial.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties met as undergraduate students at McMaster
    University in Hamilton and continued their studies at Queen’s University where
    the husband attained a Masters of Electrical Engineering and the wife a degree
    in Education.  The parties married in
    1980 when they were both age 24.  They separated
    for the final time 23 years later, in July 2003.  At that time, they were 48 years of age.  They are now 54 years of age.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the parties married, the wife was teaching in <span
class=SpellE>Picton</span> and the husband was beginning his doctoral studies
    at McMaster.  The wife left <span
class=SpellE>Picton</span> to join the husband in Hamilton, where she was able
    to obtain a full-time teaching position.  Two years later, after the husband received his doctorate, the parties
    moved to Ottawa because the husband had accepted employment in that city.  Initially, the wife was able to obtain employment
    in Ottawa only as a supply teacher, but she later obtained a full-time teaching
    position at the Canadian Armed Forces Base.  The following year, 1983, the parties’ first
    child, Jeffrey, was born.  After his birth,
    the wife hoped to “re-establish” her teaching career.  However, she accepted the husband’s request to
    expand their family instead.  In 1985,
    she gave birth to their second child, Thomas.  For three years, the wife stayed home to care for the boys.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1986, the husband accepted a position at McMaster
    and the family returned to Hamilton.  The
    wife, who spent the first year setting up the household, expressed an interest
    in pursuing graduate studies in psychology at McMaster.  The husband <span class=GramE>responded  that</span> they “could not afford it.”  So instead, the wife supply taught with the
    Hamilton Public School Board.  In 1988,
    she accepted a part-time teaching position at a private school, which became a full-time
    contract position in 1990.  Apart from a
    four-month maternity leave when Louise was born in 1992, the wife has continued
    to teach at the same school.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons the parties decided in favour of the
    wife’s position at the private school was because it came with important staff
    benefits.  Those benefits made it
    possible for all three of the parties’ children to attend the school at reduced
    cost for workplace daycare and then for primary and secondary school.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the terms of the wife’s employment also meant
    that she was required to work longer hours than had she taught at a public
    school. Teachers at the wife’s school were and are required to be involved in
    extensive extra-curricular activities outside school hours, including on some
    weekends.  In addition, the wife’s
    employment is not unionized.  It is
    contract employment, renewable annually.  The husband holds his position at McMaster on a different basis.  He is a tenured university professor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When both parties worked during the marriage, they each
    contributed to the family expenses.  The wife
    contributed her earnings as a teacher. Initially, the husband contributed his
    scholarship funds and his earnings as a teaching assistant and later, his
    income as a professor.  The husband’s
    employment at McMaster entitled him to benefits, which included reduced tuition
    for family members.  The wife later took
    advantage of this benefit and returned to school, although she continued to
    work full time.  By 2002, the year before
    the parties’ separation, the wife had obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in
    Geography, which enabled her to move from teaching primary school to teaching
    secondary school.  Because she had done
    so well in her studies, McMaster invited the wife to pursue graduate studies.  However, she testified that she “had to”
    return to work.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties contributed significantly to housework and
    childcare throughout the marriage.  While
    each testified that they contributed more than the other, the husband acknowledged
    that he worked long hours to advance his career, particularly in the initial years.  He also accepted that the wife remained at
    home for periods of time to care for the children.  Despite these acknowledgments, the husband
    maintained the position that he assumed a disproportionate share of domestic
    responsibilities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The latter years of the parties’ cohabitation became
    increasingly difficult.  The parties temporarily
    separated in both 2001 and 2002.  The
    2002 separation occurred when the wife was involuntarily hospitalized after she
    suffered a breakdown.  In the midst of
    her hospitalization, the husband served the wife with an order excluding her
    from the matrimonial home and restraining her contact with Louise, which he
    testified he did out of concern for Louise’s safety.  The husband also served a copy of the order
    on the principal of the wife’s school.  Despite
    this, <span class=SpellE>some time</span> after her discharge from hospital, the
    wife and the husband made a final unsuccessful attempt to reconcile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the primary tensions leading to the eventual breakdown
    of the marriage arose from the parties’ different perspectives on financial
    issues.  As the trial judge observed, the
    parties lived a frugal lifestyle.  They
    did so in part to accommodate their children’s education and extra-curricular
    activities and in part to pay down their mortgage expeditiously.  Nonetheless, the husband and the wife disagreed
    about financial matters.  Increasingly,
    the wife expressed a desire to achieve some measure of financial independence.  In response to her concerns, the husband suggested
    three options for re-organizing their finances.  The wife acceded to the option of the husband’s spreadsheet accounting system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under this system, the husband meticulously entered the
    details of all the parties’ expenses. At the beginning of each month, the husband
    presented his spreadsheet to the wife and sought her contribution in an amount proportionate
    to their respective incomes.  After
    making her payment, the wife was able to spend the balance of her income as she
    wished.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During one of the parties’ separations, the husband removed
    the wife from his benefits plan.  He said
    he did so because he was unhappy about her conduct, which he testified appeared
    to him to be a rejection of their marriage.  As a result, the wife was required to obtain her own benefits through
    her school.  Unfortunately, her benefit
    plan provided less coverage than did the husband’s plan, which would have
    caused her increased expense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the spring of 2003, the husband asked the wife for a
    separation.  When they separated that
    July, their first son, Jeffrey, was approaching his second year in engineering at
    McGill.  Their second son, Thomas, would begin
    his engineering studies at McMaster in September.  Louise, then age 11, was in <span
class=GramE>elementary  school</span>.  The children resided with their father.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By letter dated May 20, 2003<span class=GramE>,  the</span> husband asked the wife to begin
    paying <i>Guidelines</i> child support
    effective July 1, 2003.  By letter dated
    October 20, 2003, and pending resolution of Louise’s custody, the wife took the
    position that she intended to pay expenses for the children directly, including
    through her contributions to their private school tuition.  She did so, but paid no periodic child
    support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the 4.5 years between separation and trial, the husband
    did not provide the wife with a proposed breakdown or details of the children’s
    s. 7 costs.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  The wife testified that she did not receive a
    comprehensive list of the husband’s expenses for the children between August
    2003 and a few days before trial.  Only
    then did the husband provide a list <span class=GramE>of  expenditures</span>, which he calculated to be
    $55,749 from the date of separation until November 2007.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  Even at trial, the husband did not provide a
    list of the children’s costs or explain how those costs had been met during the
    pre-trial period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband’s claim included substantial amounts for the
    children’s medical and dental expenses.  Unfortunately, the extent to which the husband was reimbursed for these
    expenses by his drug plan was not clear.  In addition, other expenses were not explained.  While the husband listed irregular amounts of
    “email transfers” to Jeffrey<span class=GramE>,  and</span> listed Jeffrey’s monthly charges to
    the husband’s MasterCard account, these figures did not show Jeffrey’s overall costs
    during his university years or his significant contributions to those costs.  The wife also challenged the husband’s claimed
    expenses, particularly a trip for Louise to stay with her aunt, as well as certain
    entertainment expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The boys, who were approximately 20 and 18 years of age
    at the time of their parents’ separation, were able to contribute to their
    post-secondary education because they earned significant summer incomes.  During his university studies, Jeffrey’s
    income included $12,722 in 2004 and $14,655 in 2005.   In addition, Jeffrey received revenue from an
    RESP that his parents had set up before their separation.  His mother also apparently gave him an
    additional $11,500, $6,000 of which came through her Aunt Helen.  A paternal uncle also gave Jeffrey $6,000 for
    his education. <span class=MsoFootnoteReference>.</span>Nonetheless, at his
    graduation, Jeffrey had a line of credit that stood at $17,424.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his studies at McMaster, Thomas continued to
    live at home with his father.  Although
    he did not find employment in the summer of 2003, and no evidence was produced
    about his 2007 income, Thomas earned an average of about $12,000 in the
    intervening summers.  He also received an
    unspecified amount of funds from his uncle, $2,594.70 from the RESP, and a $6,000
    contribution from his mother through Aunt Helen.  In addition, Thomas was awarded annual
    bursaries of $3,100.  Although the
    bursaries were a taxable benefit for the husband, they significantly reduced
    Thomas’ annual McMaster tuition from $5,700.  After Thomas completed his four-year engineering and business degree in
    2007, the wife gave him a further $15,000, which also came through Aunt Helen.  Those funds enabled Thomas to take an additional
    year to obtain his Masters of Business Administration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the wife gave Thomas a Blackberry and paid
    his monthly charges until his MBA graduation.  She also contributed toward furnishing an apartment for Thomas the
    summer he worked in Toronto. The wife testified that she also paid for other
    expenses for Thomas, which appear to total approximately $2,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By 2007, Thomas had a student line of credit, which stood
    at $10,000.  Yet Thomas was able to
    afford vacations in Europe, the Bahamas, Costa Rica and Vermont during his
    university studies.  Although still in
    school, Thomas also held investments that he purchased for approximately
    $13,000.   As the trial judge concluded, Thomas chose “to
    use his own assets to make investments rather than retiring his [student] debt.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of trial, both boys continued to live with
    their father in the former matrimonial house.  Although Thomas has since graduated, and apparently both boys have been employed
    in jobs commensurate with their advanced education, neither appeared to contribute
    anything to room and board at the time of trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Louise, born in 1992, was 11 years old when her parents
    separated.  She is now 17 years of age
    and in the final stages of high school.  She continues to live with her father and attend the private school
    where her mother teaches.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on her pleadings, the wife assumed the cost of Louise’s
    private school tuition and expenses, which amounted to $13,800 in 2004.  In 2005, Louise’s basic tuition was $14,870.  In 2006 and 2007, the cost of Louise’s tuition
    fell to $5,200 and $6,615 respectively after Louise was awarded a $5,000
    scholarship. The wife paid income tax resulting from her staff tuition discount,
    which was a taxable benefit, as well as a $700 annual expansion fund fee to the
    school.  The wife also paid for Louise’s
    field trips, books and school expenses in addition to her cell phone expenses,
    her dance and violin lessons, violin rental, and her summer music camp fees.  Finally, the wife contributed $6,000 to
    Louise from the money that came through Aunt Helen.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, with the husband’s apparent tacit consent, the wife
    made significant s. 7 contributions to or on behalf of the children from the
    date of separation to trial.  The husband
    did not pay his 60% share of the wife’s s. 7 expenditures and the wife did not
    pay her 40% share of the husband’s s. 7 expenditures.  Neither did the wife pay periodic child
    support, which the husband claims would have amounted to approximately $77,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the husband and the wife still teach.  The husband continues to work as a professor
    at McMaster where he has the security provided by his tenure.  He is also able to work beyond age 65.  The husband apparently earned $120,232 in
    2004; $131,613 in 2005; $133,754 in 2006, and $137,656.30 in 2007.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    contract, subject to annual review, and without the security provided by tenure
    or by union protection.   The wife apparently
    earned $83,795 in 2003; $80,350 in 2004; $82,301 in 2005 and $86,416 in
    2006.   The trial judge found the wife’s
    2007 income to be $85,000, an amount that is not significantly contested by the

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE PROCEEDINGS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In February 2004, seven months post-separation, the
    husband initiated a seven-page Application.  The Application made general claims, including one for child support.  The husband’s supporting material did not
    detail past or future s. 7 childcare costs.  In June 2004, the wife filed a 25-page detailed Answer, in which she
    claimed custody of Louise as well as child and spousal support.  The wife’s Answer listed her claimed contributions
    to the children’s expenses in 2003 and 2004.  It also pleaded <span class=GramE>her  position</span> that the boys were essentially
    self-supporting due to their significant earnings and Thomas’ subsidized
    tuition.  The husband filed no Reply to
    the Answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither party took any steps to advance either an interlocutory
    or a final disposition of the support issue.  Apart from a 2005 letter in which the husband wrote directly to the wife
    addressing the children’s dental expenses, and also asking for arrears and
    ongoing child support, nothing happened.  In 2006, the parties apparently <span class=GramE>bifurcated</span> the
    proceedings and settled certain issues, including the husband’s custody of
    Louise and the transfer of the matrimonial home to the husband.  Still, neither party sought interim support.  The husband was apparently content to leave matters
    as they stood with the wife dealing directly with the older children.  In turn, the wife did not press her claim for
    spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the beginning of trial, the husband argued that the wife’s
    failure to pay child support meant that his household suffered financially: he
    had to wear his son’s outgrown clothing, drive a 10-year-old van, re-amortize
    his mortgage and forego necessary repairs to the back deck.  The wife testified that her post-separation standard
    of living was lower than the husband’s and that she received financial
    assistance to meet her needs from Aunt Helen, her late Uncle Leonard and a
    personal line of credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a three-day trial, the trial judge issued four
    pages of reasons.  He granted the parties’
    divorce, which was uncontested.  He observed
    that the parties had “no formal arrangement as to custody, child support and
    spousal support” pending trial.  The
    trial judge also noted the wife’s position that she had provided support for
    the children since the separation, including the $18,000 ($6,000 per child)
    payment that originated with Aunt Helen.  He concluded that the “wife has supported the children and paid her
    proportional share of the extraordinary expenses from the date of separation to
    the trial” and that the husband had not “provided a sufficient evidential basis
    by way of his calculations to demonstrate that the wife has not paid her 40%
    proportional share of those expenses.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to spousal support, the trial judge properly
    observed that the husband would have “incurred a disproportionate share of the
    everyday expenses as the children were living with him.”  In light of the childcare expenses the husband
    had assumed, the trial judge observed that the husband had not been in a position
    to pay spousal support and the wife had not been in need.  He dismissed the wife’s claim for
    retrospective spousal support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge allowed the wife’s claim for
    prospective spousal support on the basis that “the wife will be paying child
    support for Louise and as well, her proportional share of the extraordinary
    expenses.”  He concluded that the wife
    had “established a need for spousal support at least during the period until Louise
    has either completed her education or gone on her own.”  It seems apparent that the trial judge considered
    the wife’s obligation to pay prospective child support to be more or less
    offset by the husband’s obligation to pay prospective spousal support.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal challenges the judgment on the basis that
    the trial judge erred by: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       setting off the wife’s contributions
    to the boys’  s. 7 expenses when the wife
    did not plead set-off;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       misapprehending the husband’s claim
    for child support as “retroactive” rather than “retrospective”; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       improperly placing the burden on the
    husband to establish that the wife had not paid her proportionate share of s. 7
    expenses; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)       awarding
    prospective spousal support; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)       <span
class=GramE>awarding</span> costs of the trial to the wife.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It appears that the challenge to the wife’s
    pleadings is raised for the first time on appeal.  The other grounds of appeal arise largely from
    the brevity of the trial judge’s reasons, which do not elaborate on the
    foundation for certain aspects of his conclusions.  Nonetheless, in my view, the trial judge’s
    reasons, apart from specific areas that I will address separately, meet the purpose
    of explaining the “why” and the “what” of the result to the litigants and are sufficient
    for the purpose of appellate review, particularly when considered in the
    context of the trial record.  That record,
    at least as it is presented to us on the appeal, provides no clarity about the children’s
    overall expenses, the parties’ and the children’s contributions to those
    expenses, the tax impact of the applicable deductions and benefits, or the
    presumptive support suggested by the <span class=SpellE>the</span> <span
class=italic1><span style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines</span></span><span
class=italic1><span style='line-height:200%;

    Justice, 2008) (</span></span><i>SSAG</i>)<i>.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, appellate <span class=GramE>counsel, who
    were</span> not trial counsel, are unable to advise what specific claims the
    parties advanced at trial.  No transcript
    of opening statements or trial argument is provided.  If trial counsel gave the trial judge
    calculations and alternative calculations for support and s. 7 expenses, they
    were apparently not filed or identified.  They certainly are not included in the record before this court.  It appears no calculations were given because
    the trial judge simply ordered child support in accordance with the <i>Guidelines, </i>without specifying a
    particular figure. <b> </b>It was only later that the trial judgment
    was amended to insert the specific amount of periodic child support.  Viewed in this light, the trial judge’s
    reasons reflect the record presented to him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I observe that the standard of review precludes an
    appellate court from interfering with a trial judge’s discretionary decision
    regarding support absent an error in principle, a significant misapprehension
    of the evidence, or unless the order is clearly wrong.  <span class=GramE>See  <i>Hickey</i></span><i> v. Hickey,</i> [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at para
    11. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, to the extent that the trial judge’s
    reasons do not adequately explain the result in a particular issue, the context
    provided by the record is sufficient to permit this court to arrive at an
    appropriate result without the need to order a new trial with its resulting
    costs and delay: see <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>,
    [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3.</p>
  <h3>(a)       The Pleadings Argument</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument on appeal, the husband submitted that
    the wife’s contributions to the boys’ s. 7 expenses should not be taken into
    consideration because the wife’s Answer only claimed a proportionate sharing of
    Louise’s expenses and failed to plead set-off for her contributions to the boys’
    expenses.  I would not accept this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her Answer, the wife specifically addressed “support
    for a <span class=GramE>child(</span><span class=SpellE>ren</span>) - other
    than table amount” and set out in detail her contributions to the children’s
    expenses, including the boys’ expenses.  From the wife’s October 2003 letter, and continuing throughout the
    pre-trial period, it was clear that she was of the view that her contributions
    offset any claim by the husband for s. 3 and s. 7 child <span class=GramE>support</span>.
     It would also have been obvious to the husband
    that the wife expected that her contributions to the boys’ expenses would be
    taken into account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the husband apparently did not advance any
    argument of prejudice at trial, an argument that could have been accommodated
    by an adjournment, if one was necessary.  The decision not to raise the argument at trial supports the conclusion that
    the husband suffered no prejudice. In any event, there is no evidence that the husband
    suffered either surprise or prejudice from any technical deficiency in the wife’s
    Answer.</p>
  <h3>(b)       Retroactivity</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband argues that the trial judge wrongly
    categorized his claim for child support as “retroactive” rather than “retrospective”.  He argues that, as a result, the trial judge
    misapprehended the nature of the husband’s claim and wrongly placed the burden
    on him to show entitlement to child support, instead of recognizing the wife’s free-standing
    obligation to pay child support from the time of the husband’s demand at
    separation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept this ground of appeal.  The “retroactive” language used by the trial
    judge simply reflected the very language used by the husband’s counsel at trial.
    The same terminology is commonly used by family law counsel and at all levels
    of courts.  <span class=SpellE>Bastarache</span> J. explains the problem at para. 2 of <i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>S. (D.B.) v. G.
    (S.R.)</span></i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:
200%;color:black;'>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231, </span>at
    para. 2.   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The awards contemplated in the present appeals are
    often termed &quot;retroactive awards&quot; because they involve enforcing past
    obligations, not ensuring prospective support. Though misleading in the
    [page241] technical sense, I will adopt this terminology in these reasons
    because it helps identify the tension that underlies such awards. Still, I must
    observe that these &quot;retroactive&quot; awards are not truly retroactive.
    They do not hold parents to a legal standard that did not exist at the relevant
    time: see <span class=SpellE><span class=italic1><span style='color:black'>MacMinn</span></span></span><span class=italic1><span
style='color:black'> v. <span class=SpellE>MacMinn</span></span></span> (1995), 174 A.R. 261 (C.A.). But they are &quot;retroactive&quot; in the sense
    that they are not being made on a go-forward basis: the parents who owe support
    (the &quot;<span class=SpellE>payor</span> parents&quot;) are being ordered to
    pay what, in hindsight, should have been paid before: [citations omitted]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With that background, while references to “retroactive”
    support may lack precision, the experienced trial judge’s use of that term
    cannot be taken to signal that he misapprehended the nature of the husband’s
    claim or the applicable legal principles.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the trial judge’s reasons show no
    misapprehension of the principle that a non-custodial parent has an obligation
    to pay child support irrespective of a specific demand for a particular payment
    by the custodial parent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case was not about the wife’s obligation, which
    was apparent, but about whether she met that obligation.  In his reasons, the trial judge noted the
    parties had no “formal” pre-trial agreement regarding support.  Before trial, the husband, who was
    represented by counsel, chose not to press for additional interim child support.
    Instead, he chose to leave the matter between the children and their mother,
    particularly for the adult boys.  Although
    this issue was not explored on the record, the husband’s decision may be explained
    by the wife’s outstanding claim for spousal support.  It may be a fair assumption that both parties
    were counselled by their lawyers to “standstill” on the issues of spousal and
    child support because a demand by one may well have triggered a demand by the
    other, or adversely affected other issues outstanding between the parties.  In any event, it was open to the trial judge
    to interpret the parties’ conduct as evidence of <span class=GramE>an  informal</span> agreement to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it did not appear on the record that the
    children suffered as a result of their parents’ arrangements, or that their
    needs, including private school, and undergraduate and graduate education, were
    not met from their own resources, as well as from those of the husband and the wife.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, apart from the question of spousal support, a retrospective
    award of 4.5 years of child support in this case may have entailed hardship for
    the wife in light of the parties’ respective circumstances at the time of trial
    and the wife’s ongoing obligation to pay prospective support for <span
class=GramE>Louise .</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
    misapprehended the nature of the relief claimed by the husband or the
    principles applicable to a determination of the issue of retrospective child support.
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>(c)       Onus  </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband argues that the trial judge improperly
    placed the onus on him to prove that the wife had failed to meet her ss. 3 and 7
    obligations. The husband bases this argument on the trial judge’s statement that
    the husband had failed to provide an adequate “evidential basis by way of his
    calculations”.  I would not accept this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, there was no real dispute that the wife
    was obligated to pay s. 3 child <span class=GramE>support</span> and her
    proportionate share of s. 7 expenses.  The
    only real dispute was whether the wife’s contributions had adequately met those
    obligations.  At trial, the husband provided
    his list of s. 7 contributions and argued that they offset the wife’s contribution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the evidence, the trial judge concluded that
    the wife’s contributions were more than sufficient to meet her
    obligations.  His reference to an “evidential
    basis” meant no more than that the husband’s calculations did not persuade him of
    a contrary result.  In particular, the husband
    did not explain at trial, or earlier, the specifics of the children’s expenses or
    how the children contributed to those expenses from their significant earnings
    and revenue.  Since the husband, and not
    the wife, was privy to this information, it fell to the husband to establish
    the baseline of these relevant expenses, specifically the ones that should be
    shared by the parties.  In the
    circumstances of this case, the husband’s list of his contributions, without
    more, was not sufficient to establish the claim.  It was particularly important for the husband
    to explain the children’s expenses and contributions in this case in light of
    the wife’s stated position that the boys were virtually self-supporting.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accepting that the wife made significant contributions,
    the trial judge made a factual finding that at least the initial $18,000 of the
    monies given through Aunt Helen constituted a contribution by the wife to the
    children’s expenses, and not a gift to the children from Aunt Helen.  This finding was open to the trial judge on
    the evidence, particularly the evidence that Aunt Helen advanced the funds at
    the wife’s request, in effect, as an advance on the wife’s inheritance.  The trial judge also accepted that the wife
    paid Louise’s tuition and related expenses as well as contributed to the boys’ expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I am not persuaded of any error in the reference
    in the trial judge’s reasons to the evidential burden.</p>
  <h3>(d)       Set-off of Periodic Support</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the husband’s calculations, in addition to the s. 7
    issue, the wife failed to pay periodic child support of approximately
    $77,000.  The husband argues that the
    trial judge erred in notionally setting-off retrospective spousal support from
    the wife’s retrospective s. 3 child support obligation.  Apart from difficulties with the figure of s.
    3 support, the husband’s position is fatally flawed in two respects.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the husband failed to demonstrate any palpable
    and overriding error on the part of the trial judge in his implicit conclusion
    that the wife’s contributions, at least to some extent, provided support for
    the children additional to the wife’s proportionate share of s. 7
    expenses.  This is clear from para. 5 of
    the trial judge’s reasons, where he finds that “the wife has supported the
    children <i>and </i>paid her proportional
    share of the extraordinary expenses from the date of separation to the trial”
    and from para. 9 where the trial judge observes that the wife “was helping
    support the children” and paying “at least” her share of the s. 7 expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also realized that any overpayment by
    the wife would not have satisfied the full amount of retrospective periodic
    child support.  This is apparent from the
    trial judge’s express recognition that the husband “incurred a disproportionate
    share of the everyday expenses as the children were living with him.”  Because the husband had a disproportionate
    share of the <span class=SpellE>childrens</span>’ costs, the trial judge
    observed that the husband “was not in a position to pay [retrospective] spousal
    support, nor was the wife in need of spousal support.”  While the trial judge did not elaborate
    further on this point, it is evident from the record as a whole, as well as from
    his final disposition, that he considered the wife’s obligation for
    retrospective periodic child support to be offset, at least in part, by the
    dismissal of her claim for retrospective spousal support.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge specifically observed that the
    parties had no “formal” arrangement for child and spousal support. This
    observation recognized the parties’ apparent informal agreement not to pursue either
    interim child or spousal support. Viewed this way, the trial judge’s refusal to
    award retrospective child support arose, in part, from the parties’ informal
    understanding or mutual acquiescence to the pre-trial status quo. Acceptance of
    the parties’ understanding was open to the trial judge, particularly where
    their mutual strategy did not result from a power imbalance or impose hardship
    on the children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, even absent the benefit of calculations
    for child and spousal support, and their tax consequences, the trial judgment,
    at least on the issue of the retrospective child and spousal support, appears
    to provide a reasonable result. Accordingly, I would decline to interfere with
    the trial judge’s exercise of discretion.  I would dismiss both the husband’s appeal in relation to retrospective
    child support and the wife’s cross-appeal in relation to retrospective spousal
    support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude by observing that in <i>Fisher v. Fisher </i>(2008), 88 O.R. (3d) 241 (C.A.), <span
class=ssl21><span style='line-height:200%'>at </span></span>para. 103, I commented about counsel “fully”
    addressing the <i>SSAG</i>.  In my view, a “full” argument on the
    application of the <i>SSAG </i>would
    generally include provision of calculator worksheets for various scenarios.
    Those scenarios should be provided to the trial judge and marked as exhibits or
    aids to the court so that they are available on appeal. When <span class=GramE>counsel
    do</span> not provide the trial court with worksheets, or fail to have those
    calculations before the appellate court, the court cannot be expected to do the
    calculations on their behalf.<a href="#_ftn6"

  <h3>(e)       Prospective Spousal Support </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his appeal, the husband argues that the trial judge’s
    award for prospective spousal support of $1,200 monthly for five years should
    be set aside and the wife’s claim dismissed.  In her cross-appeal, the wife argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to award her a larger amount of spousal support retrospective to the
    date of separation and in limiting the duration of prospective spousal support
    to five years.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I consider this aspect of the appeal mindful of the
    deference owed to a trial judge’s discretionary support decision and also
    mindful of the factors and objectives set out in ss. 15.2 (4) and (6) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, <span

    reasonable period of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the trial judge’s reasons did not directly
    address the important threshold issue and pre-condition to an award for spousal
    support: entitlement. The only explanation the trial judge gave for a spousal
    support award was that the wife had established “a need for spousal support at
    least during the period that Louise has either completed her education or gone
    on her own.” It appears to be for the same reason that the trial judge
    restricted the spousal support award to five years, which was the amount of
    time that Louise would likely need to complete her undergraduate education.  There is an obvious problem with this
    reasoning: “need” is only one factor relevant to entitlement to an award of
    spousal support.  It does not encompass the
    other objectives and factors that a court is mandated to consider under the <i>Divorce Act</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even though a recognition of the factors and objectives
    informing the question might have otherwise been evident from a reading of the experienced
    trial judge’s reasons in conjunction with the record as a whole, in light of
    the trial judge’s exclusive reference to “need”, which amounts to an error in
    principle, it is necessary for this court to satisfy itself that the wife properly
    established the necessary prerequisite of entitlement.  In my view, there is sufficient evidence in
    this record to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband argues that the wife is not entitled to
    spousal support on the basis of <i>Calvert
    v. Steward</i>, [2009] O.J. No. 528 (S.C.); however, the facts in <i>Calvert</i> differ significantly from the
    facts in this case. In <i>Calvert</i>, the wife
    was a physician.  The husband was paying
    her child support.  She sought additional
    child support as well as spousal support.  In dismissing her claim for spousal support, the trial judge
    specifically found that the marriage did not hamper the wife’s career, which he
    described as “her passion”.  In any
    event, the trial judge also observed at para. 66 that, after the deduction of child
    support from the husband’s income, there was not much difference in the parties’
    net incomes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the wife argues entitlement to spousal
    support on the basis that she subordinated her career to that of the husband.  In the early years of the marriage, the
    family moved three times due to the husband’s education and employment.  As a result of these moves, the wife’s
    employment was restricted at times to part-time substitute teaching.  In addition, the wife took approximately three
    years out of the paid workforce to care for the two boys as well as apparently
    a further year to set up the family’s home in Hamilton.  The evidence also suggested that the parties’
    circumstances may have required the wife to forego graduate studies.  The evidence disclosed that the wife suffered
    health issues during the marriage, including pregnancies that resulted in
    miscarriages, as well as her breakdown in May 2002.  Finally, the wife points to the consequences of
    the parties’ joint decision that she <span class=GramE>accept</span> her
    current private school position, a decision made in the best interests of the
    children, but with long-term consequences for the wife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband points to his financial circumstances
    post-separation and argues that the wife is not in need of spousal support because
    her financial statement showed no shortfall between her income and her expenses.  The husband is correct. The wife’s financial
    statement simply matched her current budget to her current revenues.  However, the wife testified that her post-separation
    lifestyle was actually lower than that of the husband.  Moreover, I observe, under s. 3.3.2 of the <i>SSAG</i>, the formulae for spousal support are
    based not on budget, but on “income sharing as the method for determining the
    amount of spousal support”. <span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the husband argues that the wife did not enjoy
    an elevated lifestyle because, as found by the trial judge, the parties lived
    frugally.  However, this argument ignores
    the fact that the wife would have benefited from the parties’ joint incomes, even
    if the parties gave priority to their children and their mortgage during the
    marriage.  In addition, the husband’s
    argument also ignores the obvious expectation that, once the children were
    grown, their joint incomes would benefit them both.  Over the 23 years of their marriage, the parties’
    expectations and interdependency would have evolved into an economic merger of their
    interests.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> That merger, together with the wife’s somewhat compromised career path, meets
    the threshold of entitlement to spousal support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the duration of spousal support.  The applicable “Custodial <span class=SpellE>Payor</span>”
    formula, set out in s. 8.9 of the <i>SSAG,</i> presumes that spousal support for the wife would be indefinite (duration not
    specified).  This presumption arises for
    two reasons.  First, the duration of the parties’
    marriage exceeded the 20 years for indefinite support referenced in the <i>SSAG</i>.  Second, the circumstances of this case met the “rule of 65”, set out in s.
    7.5.3 of the <i>SSAG,</i> because the wife’s
    age of 48 at the time of separation and the 23-year duration of their marriage
    add up to 71.  I observe that the <i>SSAG</i> presumptions regarding duration and
    age simply reflect case law awarding indefinite support in long-term marriages
    where dependency on lifestyle is established and recognize that a spouse’s age
    at separation is relevant to the person’s ability to become self-supporting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in this case did not award indefinite
    support.  Even when combined notionally
    with the pre-trial period of 4.5 years, a total of 9.5 years of spousal support
    is not “indefinite”.  The trial judge did
    not explain why he did not order indefinite support, apart from his reference
    to the wife’s “need” during the five years she would likely be paying child
    support.  Given the “economic merger” between
    the parties, the uncertainties surrounding the wife’s employment, and the husband’s
    security of employment, I see no basis to time-limit spousal support.  Accordingly, I would accept this ground of cross-appeal
    and vary spousal support to remove the termination date, understanding of
    course that the husband is free to seek to revisit ongoing entitlement on a
    variation application, particularly on an application to terminate support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the issue of the appropriate amount of
    spousal support.  The Custodial <span
class=SpellE>Payor</span> formula of the <i>SAGG</i> produces a lower range of spousal support than would be provided by the
    application of other formulae.  This is
    because the formula was developed to recognize the obligations that fall on the
    custodial parent, the custodial parent’s responsibility for post-separation
    childcare, and the priority to be given to child support, as well as the length
    of the marriage, the usually older age of the remaining dependent children, and
    a non-custodial parent’s usual pre-separation contributions to the children’s
    care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties’ apparent incomes at trial were
    approximately $137,000 and $85,000.  The
    closest <i>SSAG </i>calculations provided to
    this court based on the “Spousal Support Paid <span class=GramE>By</span> Custodial Parent” formula incorporated an income of $133,754 for the husband
    and $86,416 for the wife.  The calculator
    worksheet projected spousal support for the wife ranging from $838 monthly to
    $1,117 monthly.  Even using the husband’s
    higher income of $137,000, the $1,200 awarded by the trial judge sits at the
    high end of the <i>SSAG</i> range.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial judge settled on the high end of the range
    (and reduced its duration) as a result <span class=GramE>of  “</span>restructuring” under the <i>SSAG</i>, his reasons do not explain the
    factors relevant to such a decision.  In
    addition to “need”, which he did consider, the trial judge was required to
    consider the duration of the parties’ marriage, their joint contributions, the
    disadvantages explained by the wife from the marriage and its breakdown, the
    financial consequences of the separation to the husband and the other factors
    mandated by the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  Had he considered those circumstances, he
    would not have awarded support at the high end of the range.  In particular, in my view, the high end of
    the range is not appropriate in light of the husband’s obligations for Louise and
    the wife’s relatively high level of income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in all the circumstances of the parties, I
    would vary the amount of spousal support payable by the husband to the wife to the
    lower end of the range and award $950 monthly, payable indefinitely. I
    emphasize that “indefinitely” only means that no termination date will be set
    at this juncture.</p>
  <h3>(f)        Trial Costs </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Following a three-day trial, the trial judge awarded
    the wife costs in the amount she requested of $24,590.35.  </span>In his brief initial and supplementary
    endorsements explaining this award, the trial judge concluded, since the wife
    was successful at trial, that she was presumptively entitled to costs by virtue
    of rule 24(1) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>:
    O. Reg. 114/99. In deciding that the wife was the successful party, the trial
    judge observed that the prospective payment of child support (for Louise) was
    not contested.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband argues that the trial judge erred in
    awarding costs to the wife because she was not the more successful party and
    because, contrary to the trial judge’s statement in his supplementary
    endorsement, the wife contested child support at trial and was unsuccessful on
    that issue. He further argues that the costs of litigating child support should
    not fall upon a custodial parent.  Finally, he argues that the trial judge erred in his quantification of
    costs. He asks that the costs award at trial be set aside and that he be
    awarded trial costs fixed at $12,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I will review each of the husband’s arguments on

    erred in finding that the wife was the successful party at trial.  I do not agree. The wife’s obligation to pay s.
    3 and s. 7 child <span class=GramE>support</span> was obvious.  The amount of s. 3 support was presumptively
    in the amount of the <i>Guidelines</i>.  There was no dispute about the wife’s

    awarded the wife prospective spousal support.  In these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that
    the wife was the more successful party at trial and to award her costs of the

    of a costs award on the interest of a child.  Nonetheless, a parent is not absolved from a costs disposition simply

    costs awarded was excessive and outside the parameters of the parties’ reasonable
    expectations, even accepting the flexibility that a court has in considering
    the rule 24(11) factors.  The husband advances
    two grounds for this position. First, he argues that the wife’s bill of costs improperly
    included attendances at conferences and other court appearances where no costs
    were allowed.  This argument is based on
    rule 24(10), which <span class=GramE>specifically  requires</span> the judge who deals with a
    step in a case to decide the question of entitlement to costs.  This court in <i>Islam v. Raham </i>(2007), 228 O.A.C. 371, observed at para. 2 “that
    the trial judge erred in failing to exclude from the award of costs amounts
    claimed for steps taken in the case where no order was made as to costs or where
    there was silence on the issue”.  In that
    case, the trial judge had improperly allowed costs where there was no order for
    costs or costs were not awarded for those appearances.  </span></p>

    reserved.  On the other hand, the husband
    does not provide an amount attributable to such appearances, nor can one be
    discerned from the record before this court.  In addition, the wife’s bill of costs was already substantially reduced
    to reflect the bifurcated nature of the custody and support proceedings.  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this
    argument.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Regarding the second argument, I do not accept that
    the trial judge’s award is equivalent to substantial indemnity costs in light
    of the bifurcated bill submitted at trial.  Moreover, the trial judge’s award is entitled to considerable
    deference.  This is because the trial
    judge alone is in a position to observe the parties and weigh the factors set
    out in rule 24(11).  Those factors
    include the reasonableness of the parties’ <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> as well as attempts to settle.  On the
    record, the husband appears to have held the upper hand throughout.  He chose not to provide the wife with a list
    of s. 7 expenses and tacitly accepted their pre-trial informal
    arrangements.  He did not respond to the
    wife’s offer to settle despite the fact that this case, which was not complex,
    cried out for a reasonable settlement.  In these and all the circumstances of the case,
    in my view, it was open to the trial judge to arrive at his disposition of
    costs.  I see no basis to interfere with
    his exercise of discretion.</span></p>

    merger, in s. 7.2, as follows: “We use this term to capture the idea that as a
    marriage lengthens, spouses merge their economic and non-economic lives more
    deeply, with each spouse making countless decisions to mould his or her skills,
    behaviour and finances around those of the other spouse...The length of
    marriage then determines the extent of the claim to be protected against this
    loss of the marital standard of living...On this view entitlement to
    non-compensatory support arises whenever a lower income spouse experiences a
    significant drop in standard of living after marriage breakdown as a result of
    loss of access to the other spouse’s income, with amount and duration resolved
    by an individual judge’s sense of fairness.  Merger over time incorporates this broad view of non-compensatory
    support and provides some structure for quantifying awards made on this basis.
    It takes account not just of obvious economic losses occasioned by the
    marriage, but also of the elements of reliance and expectation that develop in
    spousal relationships and increase with the length of the relationship.”  (Footnotes omitted.)</p>
