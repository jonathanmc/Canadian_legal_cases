  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael Slaunwhite appeals from the order of Justice Kershman dated
    December 8, 2008, with reasons dated May 14, 2009.  The order dismissed the
    appellant’s claim for a variation to the consent custody order in place.  The
    appellant now seeks joint custody with his former partner Kelly Ann McLaughlin
    of their five-year-old daughter Makayla, and an equal parenting schedule for Makayla. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the application judge erred in not applying to
    the custody issue the standard of material change set out in the separation
    agreement.  However, on the application, the only standard put to the
    application judge was that found in the statute.  We are in no position to know
    why that was, nor how the evidence might have been different had the appellant
    put forward the standard now contended for.  Nor do we have any assistance from
    the trial judge on the question.  In the circumstances, we would not give
    effect to this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to his disposition of the custody issue, the judge below considered
    the evidence before him, and carefully assessed the three changes put to him as
    material.  We can see no basis for interfering with the conclusion he came to
    about them, namely that none constitute a material change.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in curtailing the
    appellant’s ability to lead evidence about the historical relationship between
    the parties and their daughter.  In our view, in the instances cited, the judge
    below was merely trying to focus the evidence of material change that was being
    advanced.  It is far from clear to us that he unduly curtailed what the
    appellant refers to as evidence of the baseline from which material change was
    to be assessed.  This ground of appeal must also fail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant contends that the application judge erred in not
    imposing an equal parenting schedule, specifically the so-called two, two,
    five, five schedule he proposed.  We disagree.  For many years and on a consent
    basis the parties agreed on a schedule that provided the father with
    approximately 12 hours of weekday contact with his daughter every two weeks,
    plus every other weekend and virtually equal holiday time.  On the application
    to vary, the judge increased the father’s weekday contact to 37 hours every two
    weeks, and maintained the other components of the father-daughter contact.  In
    making this substantial change, the application judge considered the relevant
    factors including, importantly, the desirability of enhancing contact between
    Makayla and her father and his new family.  We can see no error in his analysis
    or his conclusion on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.  Costs to the respondent fixed at
    $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
