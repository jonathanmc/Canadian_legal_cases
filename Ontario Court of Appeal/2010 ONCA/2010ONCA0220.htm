  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    issue in this appeal is whether a conditional sentence is an available sentence
    for a robbery conviction in which it is found that the underlying conduct
    involved the use or attempted use of violence.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    respondent pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery.  The underlying facts involved his walking
    into an LCBO store, armed with a five-inch knife that he used to persuade the
    cashier to hand over $955.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    Crown sought a penitentiary sentence of three to five years.  The sentencing judge acceded to the
    respondent’s submission that a conditional sentence was available and
    appropriate and imposed a sentence to be served in the community of two years
    less one day, followed by two years of probation.  The trial judge also imposed orders under s.
    109 and s. 487.051 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    R.S.C<i>.</i>1985,<i> </i><span class=GramE>c</span>.<i> </i>C-46.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    Crown appeals the sentence on a question of law alone, pursuant to s. 759(2) of
    the <i>Code</i>.  The Crown submits that the sentence was illegal.  Section 742.1 states that a conditional
    sentence is not available to a person convicted of a “serious personal injury
    offence” as defined in s. 752.  Section
    752 of the <i>Code</i> defines the first
    branch of “serious personal injury offence” as “an indictable offence …
    involving the use or attempted use of violence against another person, or
    conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person
    or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological damage upon another
    person.”  The second branch of the
    definition covers sexual offences.  The
    trial judge found that the robbery in this case involved the use of violence.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>However,
    the trial judge, upon considering the relevant provisions of the <i>Code</i>, held that although the respondent committed
    an offence involving violence, the violence was not sufficiently serious so as
    to “meet the test of a serious personal injury offence”.  She reasoned that, properly interpreted and
    read together, the <i>Code </i>provisions
    allow <span class=GramE>a trial</span> judge discretion to assess whether the
    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence support a finding that
    an objective threshold of severity in the violence has been met, in order to
    elevate the offence to the serious personal injury offence realm. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>I
    would allow the appeal.  In my view, the
    key to fulfilling the relevant criterion of a “serious personal injury offence”
    is a sustainable finding of violence.  Once the accused is found to have committed an act of violence, a
    conditional sentence is not available, per s. 742.1.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>I
    would therefore set aside the conditional sentence on the basis that it is an
    illegal sentence and replace it with a custodial sentence of six months,
    followed by two years of probation.  However, in the light of the fact that the respondent has served his
    conditional sentence apparently without incident, in my view justice would not
    be served by incarcerating him at this stage.</span></p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <h2>1.         The Offence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    facts agreed upon in the course of the guilty plea disclose the following.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    after noon on December 6, 2007, the respondent entered an LCBO store in Thunder
    Bay, Ontario and approached the cashier from behind.  He touched her shoulder, produced a knife
    with a five-inch blade, and, holding it close to her, said “this is a robbery”.  The cashier put an amount of cash into an
    LCBO bag and gave it to the respondent.  The cashier was not physically injured. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>About
    20 minutes later the police apprehended the respondent.  Upon his arrest, an LCBO bag fell from his
    jacket.  The bag contained $955 including
    a $10 bill the LCBO used as “bait money”.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    respondent cooperated fully with the police and, after being provided with his

    the time of the offence, the respondent was 50.  He had lived in Red Rock, Ontario, all of his life.  He has a grade 10 education, is divorced and

    30 years, the respondent was employed by a local paper mill until 2005 when the
    mill was closed.  The respondent actively
    sought replacement employment but was unsuccessful.  His social assistance was terminated shortly
    before the robbery. </span></p>

    it?  Well I lost my job at the mill, I
    then got cut off pogie, and I didn’t know what else to do.”  The respondent authored a note of apology to
    the victim in which he said “All I think about is how scared you must have been
    that day.  And for that I am truly
    sorry.  Please accept my apology”.   </span></p>

    can be committed in many ways, not all including the use or attempted use of
    violence. Section 343(a) applies to a robbery committed with violence.  It is categorically a crime of violence -
    violence is an essential element of an offence under that section.  The same cannot be said about s. 343(d).  From the wording of that section it is clear
    that the use or attempted use of violence is not an essential element.  </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

    hand over the money.  In support of this
    proposition, the respondent relies on the trial judge’s words found in the next
    paragraph that “[he] did not utter verbal threats of violence.  He simply displayed the knife when he
    conducted the robbery”.</span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;

    behaviour that established that the offender constituted a danger to the
    public. Further, the court had regard to the reasons of La Forest J. in <i>R. v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309,
    who concluded at para. 43 that the dangerous offender provisions did not
    constitute cruel and unusual punishment in part because the provisions referred

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The respondent argues that the trial
    judge was correct in following the reasoning in <i>Neve.</i> He points out that Parliament chose not to specifically
    exclude robbery from the conditional sentence provisions.  Yet, absent a qualitative analysis of the
    severity of the violence, virtually all robberies may be caught by the wording
    of the sections, given the requirement for violence or a threat of violence in
    the definition of robbery under s. 343(a)<b><i>.</i></b></span></p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>I agree with the appellant that the
    preferable line of reasoning is that represented by <i>Goforth</i>. The plain wording of the section is that an offence
    meets the definition if it is a serious offence, described as one that proceeds
    by indictment and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years or more, and involves
    the use or attempted use of violence against a person, or endangerment of life
    or safety. There are clearly ways in which robbery may be committed without the
    use or attempted use of violence against a person, such as the use of violence
    or a threat of violence to property under s. 343(a). </span></p>

    the argument of the respondent (accused) relying on <i>Neve,</i> that the violence or endangerment on which the Crown relied

    availability of a conditional sentence:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In our view, the restrictive definition adopted by

    not apply in the context of s. 742.1 which authorizes the imposition of a

    definition of serious personal injury offence are not present here. In the
    context of s. 742.1, the use or attempted use of violence suffices and does not
    require any overlay of objective seriousness.</p>

    with the legislative history of the sections in question, the persuasive
    authority of other jurisdictions, and the plain meaning of the words in s. 752,
    I disagree with the trial judge’s reasoning that the conduct underlying the
    offence, once identified as including violence or the use of violence, must
    rise to a level of serious violence so as to be identified as a serious
    personal injury offence.  In my view, a
    court is obliged by the s. 752 definition of “serious personal injury offence”
    to determine whether the circumstances of the case demonstrate violence or
    attempted violence.  Once demonstrated,
    there is no obligation to go further and measure the degree of violence. </span></p>

    response to the concern about the loss of discretion is two-fold.  First, it is clear from the legislative and

    actions constituted the use or attempted use of violence will always be within

    would allow the appeal and set aside the sentence.  I would replace it with a custodial sentence of six months.  Having regard to the fact that the respondent has served approximately 13 months of his conditional sentence without incident, I am of the view that justice would not be served by his being incarcerated at this stage.  The time the respondent has served under the conditional sentence should be applied against the six-month sentence I would impose such that the six-month sentence is considered to have been fully served. </span></p>
