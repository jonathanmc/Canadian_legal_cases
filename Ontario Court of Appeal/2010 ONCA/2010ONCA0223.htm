  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In separate proceedings, Denis Quenneville and Ian
    Stirling were each found not criminally responsible on account of mental
    disorder (“NCRMD”) for the offences with which they were charged.  They each consented to that finding.  They have each appealed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both appellants argue that the failure to undertake an
    inquiry to ensure that their consent to an NCRMD finding was voluntary and
    informed, like that provided by s. 606(1.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for those pleading guilty, violated their rights
    under ss. 7 and 15 of the <i>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  Because of
    this common argument, these appeals were ordered to be heard together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each appellant also raises additional arguments.  Mr. Quenneville contends that the NCRMD
    finding in his case must be set aside as unreasonable.  Mr. Stirling argues that the court in his
    case erred in law in failing to try the issue of his fitness to stand trial before
    he entered his plea; that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; that
    the NCRMD finding in his case is unreasonable; that the trial judge’s reasons
    are insufficient; and that the fresh evidence he has tendered requires that the
    NCRMD finding be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss all these
    arguments and order that both appeals be dismissed.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The facts in the Quenneville appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Quenneville was charged with assault, assault with
    a weapon, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace
    and uttering threats, all arising from a number of incidents between December
    26, 2002 and January 11, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 2, 2003, Mr. Quenneville was ordered to undergo
    an assessment to determine his fitness to stand trial, and his criminal
    responsibility under s. 16(1) of the <i>Code.</i>  This led to a preliminary psychiatric report dated
    June 19, 2003 by Dr. R. B. Balmaceda, followed by his final assessment report
    dated September 2, 2003.  In his
    preliminary report, Dr. Balmaceda opined that Mr. Quenneville did not satisfy
    the criteria of unfit to stand trial, but stated that he was not in a position
    to address the NCRMD issue.  In his final
    report, Dr. Balmaceda maintained his position that Mr. Quenneville was fit to
    stand trial and also concluded that, at the time of the alleged offence, he did
    not appear to satisfy the NCRMD criteria in s. 16(1) of the <i>Code.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 2, 2003, Mr. Quenneville appeared before the
    Ontario Court of Justice.  The Crown
    elected to proceed summarily on each count.  Mr. Quenneville pled not guilty.  His counsel indicated that this plea was
    because of lack of criminal responsibility.  The Crown joined the defence in urging the court to find him NCRMD.  The Crown read the facts of the offences into
    the record.  Through counsel, Mr.
    Quenneville admitted some of the facts and agreed that if witnesses were called,
    they would give evidence of the remaining facts which he could not dispute.  Dr. Balmaceda’s reports were tendered as
    exhibits.  Ultimately the court agreed
    with the submissions of both Crown and defence that, at the time of these
    offences, Mr. Quenneville was NCRMD.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Quenneville appealed this finding.  Before the summary conviction appeal court,
    he conceded that there was sufficient evidence to find that he suffered from a
    mental disorder, the first condition required by s. 16(1) of the <i>Code</i>.  However, he argued that the second required condition was not met
    because there was no basis upon which to find that the mental disorder rendered
    him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the acts for which he
    was charged, or of knowing that those acts were wrong.  The summary conviction appeal judge did not
    agree, and on July 4, 2007, dismissed his appeal.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The facts in the
    Stirling appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stirling was charged on November 16, 2001 with the
    indictable offence of attempting to break and enter into a dwelling home with
    intent to commit an indictable offence.  Early in the proceedings, his fitness to stand trial arose as an issue,
    and on November 19, 2001, an assessment of his fitness was ordered.  This assessment resulted in a psychiatric
    report dated November 26, 2001 from Dr. William Komer indicating that Mr.
    Stirling may not be fit to stand trial, although his fitness may
    fluctuate.  Dr. Komer added that there
    might also be an issue of Mr. Stirling’s criminal responsibility at the time of
    the alleged offences because of mental disorder.  Dr. Komer repeated this opinion in his second
    report dated February 24, 2002.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Komer’s third report was dated March 22, 2002.  In it he concluded that Mr. Stirling was fit
    to stand trial, but that at the time of the alleged offences, he was likely not
    criminally responsible due to his mental disorder.  That report was sent to the court and when
    Mr. Stirling appeared on March 26, 2002, his counsel advised the court that it
    was forthcoming.  The report was in fact
    marked received on March 26, 2002.  When
    Mr. Stirling next returned to court on March 28, 2002, he was remanded in
    custody to ensure his continued fitness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 8, 2002, Mr. Stirling again appeared before
    the Ontario Court of Justice.  Dr.
    Komer’s reports of February 24, and March 22, 2002, were marked as
    exhibits.  Mr. Stirling then pleaded not
    guilty, and the facts alleged by the Crown were read into the record.  They were not disputed.  Both the Crown and defence counsel took the
    position that Mr. Stirling should be found NCRMD.  Dr. Komer was then called by the Crown to
    give evidence.  Although no one that day
    had raised the issue of Mr. Stirling’s fitness, Dr. Komer gave evidence that he
    was indeed fit and also that he was not criminally responsible on account of
    mental disorder.  The hearing concluded
    with the court finding Mr. Stirling NCRMD.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I propose to address each of the issues recited earlier
    in turn.  As a preliminary matter, Mr.
    Quenneville seeks leave to appeal from the decision of the summary conviction
    appeal court.  As the Crown acknowledges,
    the <i>Charter </i>issues he seeks to raise
    have clear significance to the administration of justice.  I would therefore grant leave, and include in
    the leave the related issue of whether the NCRMD finding in his case was
    unreasonable, a question of law with significant consequences for him.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The section 7 issue</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants both argue that where an accused seeks
    or proposes to consent to an NCRMD finding, the <i>Code</i> violates s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> in failing to first mandate an inquiry into whether the accused does so with
    knowledge of the full consequences of the finding.  They argue that this violation follows from
    their proposed principle of fundamental justice, namely that an accused person
    who is criminally responsible at the time of the offence should not, even on
    consent, be found NCRMD.  While they do
    not argue that the process for accepting a plea of guilty provided in s.
    606(1.1) of the <i>Code</i> is
    constitutionally required, they say that it describes the type of inquiry that
    they contend the <i>Code</i> must provide in
    the NCRMD context, and which was not accorded to either of them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to a detailed consideration of this
    argument, it is useful to highlight several aspects of the context in which it
    must be considered.  First, it addresses
    the situation of those accused persons who propose to seek or consent to an NCRMD
    verdict.  Since an unfit accused can do
    neither, these accused persons must necessarily meet the requirements for
    fitness to stand trial.  In addition, s.
    16(2) of the <i>Code</i> provides that these
    accused are at that point presumed not to be NCRMD until the contrary is proved
    on the balance of probabilities.  Finally, the process under which accused persons are found NCRMD is set
    out in Part XX.1 of the <i>Code</i>.  That part provides a comprehensive scheme
    governing their treatment from pre-verdict, to the NCRMD finding, through to
    the post-verdict disposition.  Nowhere
    does Part XX.1 specify the kind of inquiry that the appellants say is
    constitutionally required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With these considerations in mind, I turn to the
    appellants’ argument.  I would reject it
    for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Part XX.1 of the <i>Code</i> was given careful constitutional consideration by the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>Winko v. British
    Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625.  It is true that the debate in that case
    focused on the post-verdict provisions of Part XX.1, particularly those dealing
    with disposition.  Nevertheless, the
    court made clear that where legislation provides for a comprehensive
    administrative and adjudicatory structure, as Part XX.1 does for those found
    NCRMD, it is appropriate to look at the scheme as a whole in determining
    whether it conforms to the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7.  The court did just that in <i>Winko</i>.  While there is no express discussion of the pre-verdict provisions of
    that Part, the court concluded that Part XX.1 does not deprive mentally ill
    accused of their liberty or security of the person in a manner contrary to the
    principles of fundamental justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if <i>Winko</i> does not fully answer the appellants’ argument, I do not accept that the
    proposed principle is a principle of fundamental justice.  The principle of fundamental justice
    confirmed in <i>R. v. I.E.M.</i>,<i> </i>[2003] O.J. No. 953 (C.A.), is that a
    person who is not criminally responsible at the time of the offence should not
    be convicted.  This principle is founded
    on incapacity for criminal intent constituting an exemption from criminal
    liability.  There is no counterpart
    principle of fundamental justice requiring that a person who is criminally
    responsible is thereby exempted from being found NCRMD.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if this were a principle of fundamental justice,
    it does not follow, as the appellants contend, that an accused person must not
    be allowed to consent to an NCRMD finding without an inquiry like that found in
    s. 606(1.1).  Ensuring that someone has
    knowledge of the full consequences of consenting to an NCRMD verdict does not
    prevent the person from consenting, despite being criminally responsible.  More importantly, the finding of NCRMD turns
    not on the consent of the accused, but on the court being required to conclude,
    on the balance of probabilities, that the criteria of s. 16(1) of the <i>Code</i> are met.  The proposed inquiry does not achieve the
    proposed principle of fundamental justice, but would do no more than add a
    possible procedural safeguard to that process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, even if an accused should know the full
    consequences before consenting to an NCRMD verdict, this does not necessitate
    an inquiry like that of s. 606(1.1).  The
    fact that someone consenting to an NCRMD verdict must be fit to stand trial
    ensures that the person is able to understand the nature and object of the
    proceedings and their possible consequences, without need to resort to an
    inquiry like that of s. 606(1.1).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appellants’ s. 7
    argument.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The section 15 issue</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the failure to provide those
    who seek an NCRMD verdict with an inquiry, like that provided by s. 606(1.1) to
    those who seek to plead guilty, discriminates against the former on the basis
    of mental disability, contrary to s. 15 of the <i>Charter.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The comparison is the wrong one for s. 15
    purposes.  Those seeking an NCRMD verdict
    are not treated differently from those seeking to plead guilty, on an
    enumerated or analogous ground.  Some of
    those who seek to plead guilty may be mentally disabled, and some may not.  That is equally true of those who seek an NCRMD
    verdict.  All those who seek to plead
    guilty receive the same procedure, whether mentally disabled or not.  The same is true for all those who seek an
    NCRMD verdict.  Neither procedure
    discriminates on the basis of mental disability.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Quenneville
    appeal: The unreasonable verdict issue</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Quenneville argues that, while there was evidence
    to support the conclusion that he suffered from a mental disorder for the
    purposes of s. 16(1) of the <i>Code,</i> there was no evidence from which it could be found on the balance of
    probabilities that the second branch of s. 16(1) was met, namely that the
    mental disorder rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality
    of his acts, or of knowing that these acts were wrong.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge had before him the facts surrounding
    the offences and the information contained in the two reports from Dr.
    Balmaceda.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also had Dr. Balmaceda’s opinion that,
    despite his mental disorder, Mr. Quenneville had the capacity to appreciate his
    actions at the time of the offences and was therefore not NCRMD.  The trial judge rejected this opinion.  In my view, he was entitled to reject it
    because there was a rational foundation in the evidence for doing so:   see <i>R.
    v. Molodowic</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 420.  While Dr. Balmaceda’s report indicates that the triggers of Mr.
    Quenneville’s command hallucinations and delusional fantasies appear to be his
    anger and his use of marijuana and Gravol, Dr. Balmaceda did not consider, in
    coming to his opinion, the impact of these triggers being present when these
    offences were committed.  He also did not
    address the evidence of the witnesses who observed Mr. Quenneville that support
    the conclusion that he was experiencing command hallucinations and delusional
    fantasies immediately prior to the offences.  Rather, Dr. Balmaceda’s opinion is simply asserted as a conclusory
    statement without explanation.  Taken
    together, these considerations provide an ample basis for the trial judge to
    reject the opinion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, for the trial judge’s finding of NCRMD to
    be sustained, there still must be enough evidence to allow a reasonable trier
    to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, at the time of the offences,
    Mr. Quenneville met the second branch of the test in s. 16(1) of the <i>Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, such evidence existed here, drawn from the
    facts surrounding the offences and the information in Dr. Balmaceda’s reports.  It is not necessary that this evidence include
    expert opinion evidence: see <i>R. v.
    Simpson</i> (1997), 16 O.R. (2d) 129 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That evidence indicated that Mr. Quenneville exhibited
    psychotic symptomatology in the form of auditory and command hallucinations and
    delusional fantasies about hurting, killing and torturing people, including
    cutting them up and putting them in a deep fryer.  His hallucinations and delusional fantasies
    were triggered by his anger and his use of marijuana and Gravol, all of which
    were present at the time of these offences.  Finally, Mr. Quenneville’s conduct surrounding the offences indicated
    that he was experiencing command hallucinations and delusional fantasies at the
    time.  The victims reported bizarre
    behaviour on his part such as talking about killing people and taking out his
    knife and saying he would “bleed” someone.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken together, this is enough for a reasonable trier
    to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr. Quenneville met one or
    both of the incapacities set out in the second branch of s. 16(1) of the <i>Code</i>.  This argument must therefore fail.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Stirling appeal</span></u></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span lang=EN-US>(a) The fitness issue<u> </u></span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stirling argues that the trial judge erred on April
    8, 2002, the day of his trial, by failing to try the issue of his fitness
    before he entered his plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree.  It is true that in his first two reports, dated November 26, 2001 and
    February 24, 2002, Dr. Komer raised the possibility that as of those dates, Mr.
    Stirling might be unfit to stand trial.  However, fitness or unfitness can change over time, and in his report of
    March 22, 2002, Dr. Komer opined that Mr. Stirling was fit.  On March 26, 2002, the court was advised that
    this report was coming.  It was stamped
    with that date, apparently indicating that it was received that day by the
    court.  At his next appearance on March
    28, 2002, the court remanded Mr. Stirling in custody “to ensure continued
    fitness”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is clear that at that point, the court
    had Dr. Komer’s March 22 report and had concluded that Mr. Stirling was fit, hence
    the remand to ensure continued fitness.  When
    Mr. Stirling next appeared for his trial on April 8, 2002, neither the Crown
    nor the defence raised any challenge to the accused’s fitness to stand
    trial.  In these circumstances, there was
    no need for the trial judge to revisit the issue of fitness on April 8,
    2002.  Although it had been done
    informally, there can be no doubt that the issue had, by that point, already
    been dealt with.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>(b) The ineffective assistance of
    counsel issue</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stirling confined his argument on this issue to a
    submission that his trial counsel (not Ms. Frazer) failed him by seeking an NCRMD
    verdict on April 8, 2002 when he had not yet been found fit to stand
    trial.  Given my conclusion on the
    fitness issue, this argument must fail.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>(c) The unreasonable verdict issue</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that his NCRMD verdict was
    unreasonable.  This argument must also
    fail.  In finding Mr. Stirling NCRMD on
    April 8, 2002, the court had before it the facts surrounding the offence, and
    Dr. Komer’s March 22, 2002 report which described Mr. Stirling’s mental
    disorder and explained why it prevented him knowing that his acts were
    wrong.  This was a firm basis for a
    reasonable trier to reach the NCRMD verdict.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>(d) The inadequacy of reasons and
    fresh evidence issues</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stirling did not press either of these arguments in
    oral argument, and both can be shortly dealt with.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, both Crown and defence agreed that an NCRMD
    verdict was appropriate.  There were no
    contested issues.  The trial judge had
    before him the facts of the offence and Dr. Komer’s opinion of March 22, 2002
    to which he gave considerable weight.  In
    the circumstances, his reasons, though brief, are sufficient for appellate
    review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stirling filed his fresh evidence, a report dated
    June 14, 2007 from Dr. Phillip Klassen, who opined that Mr. Stirling could not
    properly be found NCRMD as of November 16, 2001, the date of the offence.  In response, the Crown tendered a further
    report from Dr. Komer dated December 16, 2007, maintaining the contrary opinion
    he offered at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Komer assessed Mr. Stirling only a few days after
    the offence.  Dr. Klassen did not do so
    until years later.  Dr. Komer had access
    to relevant records that disappeared and were not available to Dr.
    Klassen.  Dr. Klassen relied heavily on
    Mr. Stirling’s current claim that when he was seen by Dr. Komer he malingered
    for the purpose of being found NCRMD.  However, since Mr. Stirling’s credibility is highly suspect, his present
    claim that he malingered for that purpose is equally suspect.  Dr. Klassen, however, accepted his claim at
    face value.  In these circumstances, the
    fresh evidence could not have affected the result.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, for all these reasons, both appeals must be
    dismissed. </p>
