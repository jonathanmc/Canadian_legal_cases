  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant in this case presented with certain
    challenges. In these circumstances, particular deference is owed to the
    findings of the trial judge. He was uniquely positioned to assess the evidence
    of the complainant, both in terms of her overall credibility and the
    reliability of her testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, apart from one exception, the complainant
    acknowledged in cross-examination that certain details of the incident, which
    she had described in her video statement to the police but neglected to mention
    in her examination in-chief, had indeed occurred. The trial judge was alive to
    this and while he accepted that there was some “inconsistency” between her
    statement and her testimony, he concluded that there was “a great deal of
    consistency between the two.” Recognizing that the complainant had not reviewed
    her video statement, and bearing in mind her challenges, the trial judge was of
    the view that the unfolding of the complainant’s version of the events did not
    undermine either her credibility or the reliability of her testimony. This was
    a call for the trial judge to make and we see no basis for interfering with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In choosing to accept the complainant’s evidence, the
    trial judge noted that she gave her evidence in a measured fashion. There was
    no attempt on her part to gild the lily. In addition, she conceded events that on
    their face might have reflected adversely on her account. As indicated, the
    trial judge was uniquely positioned to consider these credibility and
    reliability indicators and we consider his assessment to be sound. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear to us that the trial judge carefully
    examined the complainant’s testimony. This is evidenced, for example, by his
    conclusion that he could not find penetration because the complainant’s
    testimony on that point was equivocal. The trial judge was also alive to other
    alleged problems in the complainant’s testimony, such as her statements about
    physical contact with police officers. He considered these matters and gave
    cogent reasons for concluding that they did not impact on his overall
    favourable assessment of her evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding that he could safely act on the
    complainant’s testimony, the trial judge referred to two items of evidence that
    he considered to be confirmatory. While he may have erred in using the DNA
    evidence in this regard, he was on solid ground in considering the
    complainant’s emotionally distressed condition shortly after the event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the misuse of the DNA evidence amounts to
    harmless error. At trial, after giving three separate statements to the police
    over a period of six months in which he denied any sexual contact with the
    complainant, the appellant for the first time admitted that he had kissed the
    complainant’s neck and breasts, albeit, he claimed, at her instigation. In this
    regard, we note that the trial judge recognized that the question of who
    initiated the sexual contact was critical to the central issue of credibility.
    He explicitly addressed that issue and resolved it in favour of the
    complainant. We see no material errors in that assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the second ground of appeal, defence counsel at
    trial raised no concerns in response to the trial judge’s suggestion that it
    was unnecessary to play the video of the complainant’s statement given the
    existence of a written transcript which both sides agreed was accurate. In the
    circumstances, we are not persuaded that the trial judge improperly curtailed
    cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acknowledges that the sentence appeal is
    moot. Accordingly, it too is dismissed.</p>
