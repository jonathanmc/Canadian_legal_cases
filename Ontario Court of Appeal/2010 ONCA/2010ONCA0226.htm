  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>I. OVERVIEW</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before Nicholas J., the appellant was
    acquitted of aggravated assault and of attempting to render the complainant
    unconscious to enable him to sexually assault her but convicted of sexual
    assault and breach of probation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant on all of the charges was the appellants
    intimate partner and the mother of the couples son. She testified that she
    consented to the appellant choking her into unconsciousness, tying her up and
    penetrating her anally with a dildo while she remained unconscious. She
    explained that she complained to the police about the incident about a month
    and a half after it happened as a result of an argument with the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the course of the trial, the trial Crown
    abandoned an application to have the complainants videotaped statement to the
    police, in which she claimed that she did not consent to the sexual activity,
    admitted for the truth of its content. Instead, the trial Crown took the
    position that choking the complainant into a state of unconsciousness constituted
    bodily harm and vitiated any consent she may have given to erotic asphyxiation.
    The trial Crown also argued that, as a matter of law, it was not open to the
    complainant to consent to sexual activity while unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dealt with the issue of bodily harm in
    the context of the aggravated assault charge, specifically in relation to the
    included offence of assault causing bodily harm. She concluded that the
    unconsciousness experienced by the complainant was transient and therefore
    rejected the Crowns submission that choking the complainant into
    unconsciousness constituted bodily harm. However, in convicting the appellant
    of sexual assault, the trial judge found that the complainant did not consent
    to being penetrated anally with a dildo. Rather, the trial judge concluded that
    the complainant and the appellant had merely discussed the possibility that
    that would occur. In addition, the trial judge held that the complainant could
    not legally consent in advance to sexual activity while unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge made several
    legal and factual errors in finding that the complainant did not consent to the
    sexual activity that occurred while she was unconscious. The appellant also
    argues that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the complainant could
    not consent in advance to sexual activity while unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Crown submits that the appellants
    arguments should be rejected, it also contends that the convictions should be
    upheld in any event because the trial judge erred in law in failing to find
    that choking the complainant into unconsciousness constituted bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. BACKGROUND</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            i) The complainant's
    testimony at trial</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was the only witness at trial. She
    testified that she and the appellant had been involved in a relationship for
    about seven years prior to the incident and had a son who was about 2 1/2 years
    old at the time of trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 22, 2007, the complainant and the appellant were
    alone at home having a romantic evening together. According to the complainant,
    both she and the appellant drank a couple of beers but they were not drunk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The couple watched a movie downstairs on the couch.
    They became amorous and went upstairs to the bedroom, where they undressed and
    became intimate. After about 10 minutes, the kinky behaviour began. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the complainant was lying on her back with the
    appellant on top of her, the appellant put his hand around her throat. The
    complainant described this conduct as a fetish. She believed that it was
    called anaspholexia, but agreed with the trial judge that it may also be
    referred to as sexualized asphyxiation. The complainant described anaspholexia
    as conduct that involves one person choking the other to the point of
    unconsciousness to heighten the sexual experience. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both in her examination-in-chief and in
    cross-examination, the complainant acknowledged that the appellant had choked
    her in this way on prior occasions. In her examination-in-chief, the
    complainant said they had experimented with it on a couple of previous
    occasions and that she believed she had been choked into unconsciousness once
    before. In cross-examination, she said they had engaged in the behaviour somewhere
    between three and ten times and she lost consciousness on more than one
    occasion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant also agreed in cross-examination that,
    on the evening in question, she knew what was coming once the appellant got his
    hands around her throat and she knew there was a possibility, even a probability,
    that she would lose consciousness. The complainant confirmed that she was
    consenting to this behaviour and that she did, in fact, lapse into
    unconsciousness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When asked in chief how long she was unconscious, the
    complainant said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I'm not entirely sure, obviously. I know it wasn't
    for very long though, and by that I mean like less than three minutes it would
    have had to have been. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant awoke to find herself on all fours on
    the edge of the bed, with her hands tied behind her back and the appellant
    penetrating her in the butt with a dildo. This conduct continued for about 10
    seconds and then the couple began having vaginal intercourse. Once they were
    finished, the complainant said her safe word to have her ties cut; the
    appellant complied with her request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant confirmed that having her hands tied
    behind her back was not uncommon; the couple had experimented with bondage on
    several prior occasions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning being penetrated in the anus with a dildo,
    the complainant said, in examination-in-chief, that that was something new they
    were trying. When asked in-chief if she had given the appellant permission to
    do this, the complainant testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. <i>Did you at
    any time give him permission to do this</i> [penetration in the anus with a
    dildo]?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>I had</i>,
    when we were doing all this kind of experimenting, I mean, we had basically
    laid out beforehand what was allowed and what was not allowed. There are
    certain things that are just not to happen and all of the rest of it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. Well, let me just delve a little bit
    deeper into what is allowed and not allowed. Any of the things that he did
    here, where it is the choking, the bondage or the dildo, were any of them
    discussed prior to the events that happened?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Well, as I had said before, we had done the
    choking before, so <span class=GramE>yes, that</span> had already been
    discussed. The tying up, that was almost common routine at the time, so yes,
    that was also discussed, and we had discussed other  yes, that other final
    point matter with the butt, and <i>we had
    both expressed, I guess, a certain interest in what it would be like</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. When you said you discussed what was
    allowed and what was not allowed, what did you indicate to him was not allowed?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. That was something we had discussed long before
    the events in question, so it wasn't like we sat there that night and stated
    what was going to happen and what was not going to happen. I mean, it was quite
    spontaneous what happened that evening. <i>Certain
    things not allowed, just silly things like, when I say let me go or we are
    done, then were done. Just certain things like that, basically stating ground
    rules</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. And how would he know when you said, We are
    done? Was that the words<span class=GramE>....</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. We had a safe word.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. You had a safe word, and what was the safe word
    that you used?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Tweety bird. The reason for that word is its
    not something you would say in the bedroom under normal circumstances,
    therefore it would stand out. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. And at any time on May 22nd, 2007, did you say
    the word Tweety Bird?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. When did you say tweety bird?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. After we had finished, I guess, the butt part of
    the evening, he began  we began to have actual intercourse, and once he was
    finished and I was finished, I said it and he let me go, well, went to get
    scissors to cut the ties and let me go.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. <i>While he
    was doing these things to you, how did you feel?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>I was
    fine. I mean, I wasn't, you know, like scared or anything if that is what you
    were trying to get at. The whole  I mean, like I said, the butt thing was a
    new thing, so there was curiosity involved in that and a certain sense of
    adventure.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, the complainant initially
    confirmed that the appellant had never previously inserted a dildo in her anus,
    but indicated she did not object to it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. In terms of having ... a dildo inserted ... in
    your butt, is that something that had happened before?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No, we hadn't done that. We discussed the
    possibility of it. At the moment I just went with it in the spirit of
    experimentation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, after being confronted with a portion of her
    evidence at the appellant's bail hearing, she adopted her prior testimony that
    anal penetration with a dildo had happened once before and confirmed that she
    consented. She explained it had happened a while ago and that she had been
    drunk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning how these events came to the attention of
    the police, the complainant explained that she and the appellant were at a
    difficult point in their relationship and having regular arguments. Following a
    particularly heated argument in which the appellant threatened to take their
    son and obtain sole custody of him, the complainant went to the police on July
    11, 2007. According to the complainant, she gave a videotaped statement under
    oath in which she described what happened on May 22, 2007 but said she had not
    given her consent to sexual activity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            ii) The Aborted<i> K.G.B. </i>Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the complainant described how the incident came
    to the attention of the police, the Crown applied to have the complainant
    declared adverse with a view to having her videotaped statement to the police
    introduced for the truth of its content if she did not adopt it: See <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-5, s. 9 and <i>R. v. K.G.B.</i>, [1993] 1
    S.C.R. 740. However, following a lunch break, and after the videotaped
    statement had been played and a ruling was made that the Crown could
    cross-examine the complainant on her statement, Crown counsel at trial (not Ms.
    Bartlett-Hughes) indicated that he had taken the opportunity to speak to senior
    Crown counsel and was now abandoning the <i>K.G.B.</i> application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to a question from defence counsel, the
    trial Crown also confirmed that he was not seeking to adduce the complainant's
    statement for the truth of its content. He said, [i]n fact, it's as if the
    statement was never put. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            iii) Relevant
    Statutory Provisions</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two statutory definitions are relevant for the purposes
    of this appeal. The first is the definition of consent as set out in ss. 265(3)
    and 271.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 265(3) describes certain circumstances in which
    consent is not obtained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>265 (3) <span class=GramE>For</span> the purposes
    of this section [assault], no consent is obtained where the complainant submits
    or does not resist by reason of</p>

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) <span class=GramE>fraud</span>; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) <span class=GramE>the</span> exercise of
    authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 273.1(1) sets out a definition of consent for
    the purposes of the sexual assault provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i> and s. 273.1(2) and (3) address circumstances in
    which no consent is obtained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>273.1</b> (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), consent means, for the
    purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273 [sexual assaults], the voluntary
    agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of
    sections 271, 272 and 273, where</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> agreement is
    expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) <span class=GramE>the</span> complainant is
    incapable of consenting to the activity;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) <span class=GramE>the</span> accused
    induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of
    trust, power or authority;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) <span class=GramE>the</span> complainant
    expressed, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;
    or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) <span class=GramE>the</span> complainant,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second relevant statutory definition is the
    definition of bodily harm as set out in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>bodily</span> harm means any
    hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            <span class=GramE>iv)
    The</span> Positions of the Parties at Trial</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the complainant's testimony, defence counsel
    at trial applied for directed verdicts of acquittal on the basis that the
    complainant consented to the conduct in issue. In response, the trial Crown
    submitted that choking another person into a state of unconsciousness
    constitutes bodily harm and that, pursuant to <i>R. v. Jobidon</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714, bodily harm vitiates consent.
    In the trial Crowns submission, this was a case of sado-masochistic sexual
    activity, and no exception to the <i>Jobidon</i> principle ought to apply. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a discussion about the legal issues <span
class=GramE>raised</span>, the parties agreed that further written submissions
    would be required. In order to avoid an unnecessary re-attendance, defence
    counsel abandoned his directed verdict application and elected not to call
    evidence. The matter was then adjourned for written submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his written argument, the trial Crown relied on <i>R. v. Jobidon</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>R. v. Welch</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 665 (C.A.) and <i>R. v.
    Robinson</i> (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 448 (C.A.), and argued that in a sexual
    context, consent is vitiated where bodily harm is intended and caused. The trial
    Crown submitted that choking the complainant into a state of unconsciousness
    constituted bodily harm as defined in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. He relied, in part, on the dissenting reasons of Lamer C.J. in <i>R. v. Cooper</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p.
    150 that [i]ntentionally and consciously choking someone for only a few
    seconds might or might not constitute the infliction of bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Crown submitted that unconsciousness
    interferes with the health and comfort of a person in a manner that is not
    trifling. While not conceding that the injury was transient, the Crown urged
    the trial judge to convict in any event on the basis that, where one person
    intentionally chokes another person into unconsciousness, it is objectively
    foreseeable that bodily harm will occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown then argued that, regardless of whether any
    prior consent to sexual conduct was given or vitiated, the complainant was
    incapable of consenting to sex while unconscious. Without the capacity to know
    what was being done to her, or to revoke any previously given consent, the
    complaint could not have validly consented during any period of
    unconsciousness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsels written submissions noted the absence
    of evidence called by the Crown to support the proposition that the choking in
    this case constituted bodily harm. No expert evidence was called on the dangers
    of choking or unconsciousness. No evidence was led as to the mechanism of
    unconsciousness (e.g. venal or arterial versus tracheal) or to the amount of
    force that was applied. Further, there was no reliable evidence as to the
    duration of the complainants unconsciousness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, defence counsel noted that the Crown did not
    produce any case law showing that choking to unconsciousness constitutes bodily
    harm. With respect to <i>Cooper</i>, the
    defence noted that stating that choking may or may not be bodily harm is
    unhelpful as it is a tautology. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faced with this dearth of evidence or case law, defence
    counsel urged the trial judge not to find bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Responding to the Crowns submissions about the effect
    of unconsciousness on the complainants prior consent, defence counsel
    submitted that the evidence showed that the complainant was consenting before,
    during, and after the sexual conduct. She had been rendered unconscious in the
    past, and foresaw the likelihood that she would lose consciousness again. Her
    consent was therefore fully informed and valid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>IV. The Trial Judge's Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In convicting the appellant of the sexual assault
    charge, the trial judge concluded that there had been discussion only of anal
    penetration, but never any consent. Although the complainants evidence at
    trial was essentially unchallenged and uncontradicted, in reaching her factual
    conclusion, the trial judge described the complainant's cross-examination as a
    typical cross-examination of a recanting complainant in a domestic matter and
    rejected two aspects of the complainants testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge rejected the complainants
    evidence that she used the safe word after she and the appellant were finished
    having intercourse. In the trial judges view, there would have been no need to
    use the safe word at that point. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge rejected the complainants
    evidence that she and the appellant had engaged in anal penetration with a
    dildo previously. On this point, the trial judge accepted the complainants
    unprompted answers that they had not done so previously rather than her
    testimony adopting evidence she gave at the appellants bail hearing. The trial
    judge concluded that the complainant would not realistically have forgotten
    about an earlier incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judges second credibility finding is
    particularly important because she appears to have used it as at least part of
    the basis for her finding that the complainant did not consent to anal
    penetration with a dildo:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The sexual activity which forms the subject of the
    sexual assault charge is the anal penetration with a dildo... On that issue, <i>I accept as credible evidence the answer she
    freely and voluntarily gave to both the Crown in the examination and to defence
    when originally questioned on this issue; namely this was a first and only the
    possibility of it had been discussed. </i>Although defence was fully entitled
    to suggest the answers to this complainant, it is a matter of weight and credibility
    for the trial judge to assess and weigh answers that do not come from leading
    and/or suggestive questions. It is also not open to defence to suggest to her
    that the evidence I should rely on is the one that was given at bail. She was
    clearly a witness on side with the defence. I accept her initial response as
    being truthful and give little weight to the answer she gave when confronted
    with incompatible evidence given at the bail hearing where she testified for
    the defence. Human experience would dictate that she would not have to be
    reminded that anal penetration had occurred on other occasions. <i>I find that she did not at any time consent
    to this penetration by the dildo in her anus.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, defence confuses the issue of whether
    loss of consciousness constitutes bodily harm to which she cannot consent
    with the notion of consent in sexual assault cases as referred to in <i>Ewanchuk</i> by our Supreme Court. It is not
    open to defence to rely on earlier authorities such as <i>R. v. Stanley</i> (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 216 (B.C.C.A.) which is no
    longer good law. <i>I have made a finding
    with respect to the credibility of the complainant on that issue; the evidence
    I accept and believe based on her own recital of the events is that there had
    been discussion only of anal penetration. As such it cannot be said that what
    happened while she was unconscious had been consented to</i>; as mentioned
    above <i>Ewanchuk</i> mandates that there be
    consent to all sexual activity and we do not have a doctrine of implied consent
    even for situations such as this one based on my extensive review of the case
    law. The decision in <i>Pedden</i> makes
    that plain, earlier consent to sexual activity, in that case <span class=GramE>fellatio,</span> does not carry over to acts that occur while the complainant is unconscious.
    The <i>Ashlee</i> decision resolves any
    doubt on the issue. In any event, even if this act occurred previously with her
    consent that consent cannot carry over to this event and particularly can never
    carry over to a situation where she is unconscious. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave lengthy and detailed reasons
    addressing the legal issues raised by counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the issue of whether bodily harm vitiated
    any consent that may have been given, the trial judge reviewed a number of
    decisions addressing this question in the context of both assaults in general
    and sexual assaults: <i>R. v. Jobidon</i>; <i>R. v. Welch</i>; <i>R. v. Donovan</i>, [1934] 2 K.B. 498 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Boyea</i> (1992), 156 J.P. 505 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Brown</i>, [1994] 1 A.C. 212 (H.L.); <i>R. v. Robinson</i>; <i>R. v. Amos</i>,
    1998 CanLII 2814 (ON C.A.); and <i>R. v.
    Quashie</i> (2005), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, the trial judge noted that in <i>R. v. Jobidon</i>, the Supreme Court of
    Canada concluded that the common law has created a body of law which
    illuminates the meaning of consent, and places limitations on the legal
    effectiveness of consent. Although <i>Jobidon</i> dealt with consensual fights, the Supreme Court of Canada expressly
    contemplated that further limitations would be found in other types of
    cases.  The trial judge concluded that
    loss of consciousness is an injury and that the legal test for vitiating
    consent to an assault has two components: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i) whether the
    injury reached the level of bodily harm as that term is defined in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, namely, any hurt or
    injury to a person that interferes with their  health or comfort and is more than merely transient or trifling in
    nature; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii) <span
class=GramE>whether</span> such harm was both intended and caused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to sexual assault cases, she referred in
    particular to this courts decisions in <i>Welch</i> and <i>Robinson</i>, and adopted Griffiths
    J.A.s comments in <i>Welch</i>, at p. 688,
    which were approved in <i>Robinson</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The consent of the complainant, assuming it was
    given, cannot detract from the inherently degrading and the dehumanizing nature
    of the conduct. Although the law must recognize individual freedom and
    autonomy, when the activity in question involves pursuing sexual gratification
    by deliberately inflicting pain upon another that gives rise to bodily harm,
    then the personal interests of the individuals involved must yield to the more
    compelling societal interests which are challenged by such behaviours. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Quite simply it is suggested that hurting people is
    wrong and this is so whether the victim consents or not, or whether the purpose
    is to fulfil a sexual need or to satisfy some other desire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in the absence of expert evidence, the trial
    judge indicated she was ill equipped... to decide the medical mechanism of unconsciousness,
    the degree of force required, the duration of force required, the duration of
    force required to cause loss of consciousness, and likely injuries associated
    with choking, strangulation or unconsciousness. Nonetheless, she expressed the
    belief that the reasonable man would conclude that choking someone to the point
    of unconsciousness [interferes] with that person's health or comfort. In
    addition, she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If <span class=GramE>this were</span> a case of
    domestic assault and the accused had choked his partner and rendered her
    unconscious in a physical dispute, I have no doubt a conviction for bodily harm
    could ensue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, albeit in relation to the aggravated
    assault charge, the trial judge concluded that the unconsciousness that
    occurred in this case constituted bodily harm but did not vitiate the
    complainant's consent because it was transient:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Assault bodily
    harm is an included offence of aggravated assault</i>. In this case I find that
    choking her to the point of unconsciousness does constitute bodily harm. <i>The lack of consciousness,</i> which I find
    to be bodily harm, <i>had been consented to
    on this occasion and in the past</i>. <i>In
    this case my finding is that the consent was not vitiated because the bodily
    harm inflicted was transient based on the only evidence I have.</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the issue of whether the complainant could
    legally consent in advance to sexual activity while unconscious, once again,
    the trial judge reviewed a number of authorities relating to this issue: <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330; <i>R. v. Pedden</i>, 2000 BCPC 13 (CanLII),
    affd (2003), 186 B.C.A.C. 260 (C.A.); and <i>R.
    v. Ashlee</i> (2006), 212 C.C.C. (3d) 477 (Alta. C.A<span style='color:black'>.)
    leave to appeal refused 2006 S.C.C.A. 415, which in turn referred </span>to the
    decisions in  <i>R. v. A.(A.)</i> (2001), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 279 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Esau</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 777; <i>R. v. Humphrey</i> (2001), 43 C.R. (5th) 258
    (Ont. C.A.); and <i>R. v. Stanley</i> (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 216 (B.C.C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although acknowledging that it was not binding on her,
    the trial judge adopted the reasons of the majority of the Alberta Court of
    Appeal in <i>Ashlee</i>. In <i>Ashlee</i>, the accused was charged with
    fondling a woman who was unconscious on the street. The woman did not testify
    and the issue was whether the Crown had to prove the absence of prior consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority set out a number of principles relating to
    consent in sexual assault cases. They observed, at para. 13, that s. 273.1(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> defines consent
    and that s. 273.1(2) defines statutory non-consent, and stated, [t]here is no
    consent to sexual activity when the complainant is incapable of consenting to
    the activity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on<i> Ewanchuk</i>, the majority noted that consent must be given to particular
    sexual activity at the time of the activity and that there is no defence of
    implied consent to sexual assault. Further, under s. 273.1(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> consent is an
    ongoing state of mind and is not irrevocable once given. As consent must be
    given at the time of the activity and is an ongoing state of mind, it ends as
    soon as the complainant falls unconscious and is no longer capable of
    consenting. As such, there is no defence of prior consent to sexual activity
    that takes place while the complainant is unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on this authority, the trial judge held that
    the complainant could not legally consent in advance to sexual activity that
    takes place while she is unconscious. The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>With respect to the s. 271 charge the Crown has met
    its burden. <i>The evidence of prior consent
    is not determinative in any way of the issue</i>. Firstly, I find that she did
    not at any time consent to anal penetration of any <span class=GramE>kind,</span> she merely discussed the possibility of such activity. <i>Even if she had consented previously, or on that night, she cannot
    legally consent to sexual activity that takes place when she is unconscious. I find that the binding
    of her hands and the forceful insertion of the dildo to be degradation and
    dehumanizing acts in the circumstances of this case.</i> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> A conviction on
    the breach of probation charge flowed from the conviction on the sexual assault
    charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the remaining charges, the trial judge noted
    that [t]he complainant's own evidence is completely unchallenged to the effect
    that choking was common practice for [the couple] and meant to heighten their
    sexual experience. She therefore acquitted the appellant of attempting to
    render the complaint unconscious to enable him to commit a sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the aggravated assault charge, the
    trial judge held that there was not sufficient evidence to permit her to find
    that the loss of consciousness had endangered the complainant's life. Further,
    although she found that choking [the complainant] to the point of
    unconsciousness does constitute bodily harm, the trial judge concluded that
    the complainant had consented to this conduct on this and other occasions and
    that her consent was not vitiated because the bodily harm inflicted was
    transient. The trial judge therefore acquitted the appellant of aggravated
    assault and of the included offence of assault causing bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><b>IV. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) Did the trial judge err in holding that the complainant did not
    consent in advance to the sexual activity that occurred while she was
    unconscious?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes three complaints about the trial
    judges finding that the complainant did not consent in advance to the sexual
    activity that occurred while she was unconscious. First, he says the trial
    judge relied improperly on the complainants videotaped statement to the
    police, which was never admitted into evidence, to formulate the view that she
    was a typical recanting complainant and tailoring her evidence to favour the
    defence. Second, he submits that the trial judges efforts to distinguish
    between discussion and consent have no solid foundation in the evidence.
    Finally, he says the trial judge misapplied <i>R.
    v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 by failing to consider whether, even if she
    disbelieved the complainant, the complainants unchallenged and uncontradicted
    evidence that she consented raised a reasonable doubt as to the absence of
    consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the evidence that was led at trial was
    simply not capable of supporting a finding that the complainant did not consent
    on a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning her factual finding of no consent, the trial
    judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The sexual activity which forms the subject of the
    sexual assault charge is the anal penetration with a dildo... On that issue, <i>I accept as credible evidence the answer she
    freely and voluntarily gave to both the Crown in the examination and to defence
    when originally questioned on this issue; namely this was a first and only the
    possibility of it had been discussed</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with this conclusion is that it appears
    to focus on what the complainant said in response to questions about whether anal
    penetration with the dildo had happened before and to ignore what the
    complainant said in-chief about whether she was consenting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point of the complainants evidence in-chief
    on the consent issue was that she had previously given her consent to anal
    penetration with a dildo when the parties had discussed what was allowed and
    not allowed and laid out ground rules. When the complainant later said in-chief
    that she and the appellant both expressed interest in the particular conduct,
    it was in the context of having already testified that she consented.  She was not asked to provide more detail about
    this aspect of the couples conversation. The gist of the complainants
    evidence in-chief was that she consented. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainants statement in cross-examination that
    she and the appellant had discussed the possibility of anal penetration with a
    dildo was given in response to a question about whether that conduct had
    happened previously. Although it was open to the trial judge to reject the
    complainants subsequent evidence in cross-examination that she and the
    appellant had previously engaged in anal penetration with a dildo, that finding
    did not alter the gist of the complainants evidence in-chief. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not make a specific credibility
    finding about the complainants evidence that she consented. Even assuming that
    she rejected that evidence what remained was a lacuna in the evidence on the
    subject of consent. The Crown had the opportunity at trial to clarify the
    complainant's evidence on this issue and failed to do so. Viewed in context, the
    complainants evidence that she and the appellant discussed the possibility of
    such conduct does not translate into evidence capable of supporting a finding
    on a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ii) Did the trial judge err in law
    in holding that the complainant could not consent in advance to sexual activity
    while unconscious?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant relies on the trial judge's
    finding that the complainant did not suffer bodily harm as that term is defined
    in the <i>Criminal Code</i> and submits that
    the criminal law does not prohibit consensual sexual activity while unconscious
    where a person gives their consent in anticipation of becoming unconscious.
    According to the appellant, none of the decisions of this court that have
    addressed the issue of sexual activity while unconscious have involved a
    situation where the complainant consented in advance to sexual activity expected
    to occur while unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the appellant points out that s. 273.1(1) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> defines consent as
    the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in
    question and argues that there is nothing novel about the suggestion that
    consent can be given to touching which is intended to occur while a person is
    unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, a competent person can consent to surgery
    which is to occur while the person is unconscious even though he or she will
    not be conscious or be able to revoke consent once anesthetised. Similarly, no
    one would suggest that an intoxicated person who asks a friend to help him get
    home and then passes out and is carried home by the friend was assaulted or
    kidnapped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that no provision of the <i>Criminal Code</i> prohibits a person from
    providing consent in advance to touching that is anticipated to occur while the
    person is unconscious. Section 273.1(2) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>prohibits obtaining consent to sexual activity from a
    person who is unconscious and provides that no consent is obtained where the
    complainant, having expressed by words or conduct a lack of agreement to continue
    to engage in the activity. It does not prohibit a person from consenting in
    advance to sexual touching anticipated to occur while the person is
    unconscious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant concedes that unless a person gives
    consent in advance to sexual contact anticipated to occur while the person is
    unconscious, sexual activity occurring after the person loses consciousness
    exhausts the prior consent because unconsciousness changes the nature of the
    sexual activity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, relying on the minority decision in <i>Ashlee </i>as well as the language of s.
    273.1, the appellant contends that permitting a person to consent to sexual
    activity in anticipation of unconsciousness is not prohibited by the express
    language of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    Moreover, it is entirely consistent with the important goal of the criminal law
    of protecting the personal integrity of individuals and providing them with
    control over who touches their body.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that prohibiting sexual
    touching which occurs while ones partner is unconscious would have the
    unwanted effect of criminalizing the behaviour of a person who touches their
    partner in a sexual way while their partner is sleeping. This is one of the
    arguments that was made in <i>Ashlee</i> and
    the dissenting judge, at p. 489, adopted the view that an individual can, while
    capable of consenting, consent in advance to being sexually touched while he or
    she is <i>unconscious or asleep</i> (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of response, the Crown contends that various
    authorities have made it clear that consent to sexual contact is legally valid
    only where a person subjectively consents to the sexual activity at the time it
    occurs. In support of its position the Crown relies on <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>; on comments made by McLachlin J. in<i> R. v. Esau</i>; and on this court's decisions
    in <i>R. v. Humphrey</i>, <i>R. v. J.R. and J.D.</i>, [2008] O.J. No.
    1054, leave to appeal denied [2008] S.C.C.A No. 231, and <i>R. v. Bell</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 1725.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept the Crown's submissions. On my
    review of the authorities and the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, I see no basis for
    holding that, as a matter of general principle, a person cannot legally consent
    in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while the person is either
    unconscious or asleep. If anything, in my view, the relevant caselaw supports
    the opposite conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a starting point, I agree with the appellant that
    there is nothing novel about the proposition that a person can consent in
    advance to touching expected to occur while the person is unconscious. At para.
    128 of <i>Jobidon</i>, the Supreme Court of
    Canada expressly acknowledged that nothing stated in that case <span
style='line-height:200%'>would prevent a person from
    consenting to ... appropriate surgical interventions</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary authority relied on by the Crown is <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>. At paras. 25 and 26 of <i>Ewanchuk</i>, Major J., speaking for the
    court, explained that the <i>actus reus</i> of sexual assault is established by proof of three elements: i) touching, ii)
    the sexual nature of the contact, and iii) the absence of consent. Although the
    first two elements are objective and can be established by proof that the
    accused's actions were voluntary, the absence of consent is subjective and determined
    by reference to the complainant's subjective internal state of mind towards the
    touching, <i>at the time it occurred </i>(emphasis
    added, citations omitted). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 31 of <i>R.
    v. Ewanchuk</i>, Major J. concluded that there is no defence of implied consent
    to sexual assault in Canadian law. He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trier of fact may only come to one of two
    conclusions: the complainant either consented or did not. There is no third
    option. If the trier of fact accepts the complainants testimony that she did
    not consent, no matter how strongly her conduct may contradict that claim, the
    absence of consent is established and the third component of the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of
    sexual assault is proven. No defence of implied consent to sexual assault
    exists in Canadian law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that these passages conclusively
    establish that a prior consent is not effective as a matter of law because
    unconsciousness deprives the person consenting of the ability to experience
    consent or know whether they are consenting <i>at
    the time the sexual activity occurs</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the Crown's argument ignores two
    important points. First, <i>Ewanchuk</i> involved a conscious complainant and the issue in the case was whether the
    trial judge erred in concluding that the defence of implied consent to sexual
    activity exists as a matter of law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The specific question in <i>Ewanchuk</i> was whether a complainants conduct could give rise to a doubt concerning
    whether she was consenting where the trier of fact accepted her evidence that
    she was not consenting.  At para. 27 of
    that decision, Major J. explained that confusion has sometimes arisen
    concerning the meaning of consent as an element of the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of sexual assault. Although, as
    a matter of common parlance, the word consent often connotes some form of
    active behaviour, in dealing with it as an element of the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence of sexual
    assault, the approach is purely subjective and the complainants internal state
    of mind is determinative.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statements in <i>Ewanchuk</i> on which the Crown relies can only be properly understood when considered in
    context. The statements are not directed at the issue of whether a person can
    consent in advance to sexual activity anticipated to occur while unconscious;
    rather, they are directed at resolving the question of whether a conscious
    complainant's conduct can give rise to a reasonable doubt on the issue of
    consent where the trier of fact accepts the complainant's evidence that she was
    not consenting. The fact that the defence of implied consent to sexual assault
    does not exist does not resolve the question of whether a person can consent in
    advance expressly to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Crowns argument ignores the fact that its
    obligation in a sexual assault case is to prove absence of consent. Where <span
class=GramE>a person</span> consents in advance to sexual activity expected to
    occur while unconscious and does not change their mind, I fail to see how the
    Crown can prove lack of consent. The only state of mind ever experienced by the
    person is that of consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, I note that at para. 28 of <i>Ewanchuk</i>, Major J. observed that
    [h]aving control over who touches one's body, and how, lies at the core of
    human dignity and autonomy and that protecting individuals security of the
    person lies at the heart of [t]he inclusion of assault and sexual assault in
    the [<i>Criminal</i>] <i>Code</i>.  Permitting a person
    to consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious or
    asleep is entirely consistent with this principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also relied on the following comments made by
    McLachlin J. at para. 73 of her dissenting reasons in <i>Esau</i> as supporting its position that a person cannot legally
    consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The complainant in this category [unconscious or
    incoherent complainants] lacks the capacity to communicate a voluntary decision
    to consent. Such lack of capacity would be obvious to all who see her, except
    the wilfully blind. This makes any suggestion of honest mistake as to consent
    implausible. To put it another way, the necessary (but not sufficient)
    condition of consent--the capacity to communicate agreement--is absent. <i>The hypothetical case of a complainant
    giving advance consent to sexual contact before becoming unconscious does not constitute
    an exception. Consent can be revoked at any time. The person who assaults an
    unconscious woman cannot know whether, were she conscious, she would revoke the
    earlier consent. He therefore takes the risk that she may later claim she was
    assaulted without consent</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the Crown's submission, if anything, in my
    opinion, these comments support the conclusion that a person can consent in
    advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in <i>Esau</i> was the availability of the defence of honest but mistaken belief in content. At
    this point in her reasons, <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> J. was
    addressing categories of situations in which the defence would be available.
    She concluded that the defence would not be available where the fact situation
    involved unconscious or incoherent complainants. However, in making the
    italicized comments, <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> J. was not opining
    that a person cannot consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur
    while unconscious. Rather, she was indicating that the defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in consent would not be available to an accused who acted on a
    prior consent where the complainant later testified about a change of mind. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> J.s statement
    that the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent would not be
    available where the complainant later changes her mind suggests that the
    consent remains valid so long as the complainant does not change her mind,
    whether immediately prior to lapsing into unconsciousness or after she wakes up. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, this court's decisions in <i>Humphrey</i>, <i>J.R. and J.D.</i> and <i>Bell</i> are not helpful to the
    Crown. None of these cases involve situations where it was alleged that the
    complainants consented in advance to sexual activity anticipated to occur while
    they were unconscious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I see nothing in s. 273.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that would prohibit a
    person from consenting in advance to sexual touching expected to occur while
    the person is unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will repeat the relevant portions of s. 273.1 for

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that s. 273.1(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>e)
    demonstrates that consent reflects an ongoing state of mind because it
    recognizes that consent can be withdrawn and that s. 273.1(2)(b) makes it clear
    that an unconscious person cannot consent to sexual activity. However, I do not
    read these provisions as prohibiting a person from expressing in advance their
    consent to sexual touching expected to occur while unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 272.1(1) defines consent as the voluntary
    agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.
    Where a person consents to sexual activity anticipated to occur while
    unconscious and does not change their mind, I fail to see how s. 273.1(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) somehow invalidates the consent. The person is
    consenting and no further consent needs to be obtained. To hold otherwise
    would be to deprive individuals of a significant aspect of their personal
    autonomy by limiting their ability to make choices about who can touch their
    body and in what circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, in my view, the trial
    judge erred in reaching the broad conclusion that a person cannot legally consent
    in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious.  In my opinion, depending on the offence
    charged, a more appropriate inquiry would be whether the complainants consent
    given in advance to sexual acts performed while unconscious was vitiated in the
    particular circumstances of the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge found that the binding
    of [the complainants] hands and the forceful insertion of the dildo to be
    degradation in the humanizing acts in the circumstances of this case. However,
    the trial judges conclusions regarding the sexual assault charge were
    premised, at least in part, on the trial judges finding that the complainant
    did not, at any time, consent to anal penetration of any kind. As I have
    explained, in my opinion, the record in this case is not capable of supporting
    that finding of fact. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, although the Crown alleged at trial that
    strangling the complainant into unconsciousness endangered the complainants
    life and constituted bodily harm, it did not make the same allegations
    concerning the sexual acts performed while the complainant was unconscious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, even assuming the appellant had
    been charged with aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault causing bodily harm,
    I see no basis for the holding that the sexual acts performed with the
    complainants consent while the complainant was unconscious were themselves degrading
    or dehumanizing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>iii) Did the trial judge err in
    law in failing to find that choking the complainant into unconsciousness
    constituted bodily harm and therefore vitiated any consent that may have been
    given?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge confined her analysis of the sexual
    assault charge to the appellant's conduct in penetrating the complainant anally
    with a dildo while the complainant was unconscious. She dealt with the issue of
    bodily harm in relation to the aggravated assault charge and acquitted the
    appellant of the included offence of assault causing bodily harm based on a
    conclusion that the unconsciousness experienced by the complainant was
    transitory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Crown submits that the trial judge erred
    in law in failing to find that choking the complainant into unconsciousness in
    the course of erotic asphyxiation constituted bodily harm that vitiated the
    complainant's consent to that sexual activity. Although the Crown did not
    appeal the acquittal on the aggravated assault charge, the Crown argues that it
    is entitled to rely on uncontroverted evidence to support the conclusion that
    on a proper legal analysis the appellant was guilty of sexual assault causing
    bodily harm and, therefore also of the included offence of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I agree that the trial judge erred in law her
    approach to the bodily harm issue, I do not agree that the Crown is entitled to
    rely on bodily harm to support a conviction for sexual assault <i>simpliciter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the trial judge erred in her approach to
    the bodily harm issue by concluding that the complainant did not suffer bodily
    based on a finding that the unconsciousness experienced by the complainant was
    transitory, and without making a specific finding concerning whether the
    unconsciousness experienced by the complainant was more than merely trifling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I interpret the statutory definition of bodily harm,
    it permits a finding of bodily harm where a hurt or injury that interferes with
    the health or comfort of the person is either more than merely transitory or
    more than merely trifling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I repeat the definition of bodily harm as set out in s.
    2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for ease of
    reference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>bodily</span> harm means any
    hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the
    person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This definition is ambiguous because of the use of the word
    or in the phrase more than merely transient or trifling. One can read this
    phrase positively, treating it as establishing alternative criteria,
    satisfaction of either one of which will qualify a hurt or injury as bodily
    harm. Read that way, the definition indicates that a hurt or injury that
    interferes with the health or comfort of a person will constitute bodily harm
    if it is more than merely transient or if it is more than merely trifling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, one can read this phrase negatively,
    treating it as establishing the categories of hurt or injury that are excluded
    from bodily harm. Read that way, the definition indicates that a hurt or injury
    will not meet the threshold for bodily harm if it is either merely transient or
    merely trifling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern rule of statutory interpretation requires that
    the provisions of an act be interpreted in their entire context and in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament: See <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at
    para. 26, citing Elmer Driedger, <i>Construction
    of Statutes</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p. 83. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adopting this approach, I conclude for three reasons
    that that a hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of a
    person and that is more than merely transient or more than merely trifling is
    sufficient to support a finding of bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on a plain reading of the definition of bodily
    harm, the focus of the section is on what constitutes bodily harm and not on
    what is excluded from the definition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the legislative history of the definition supports
    this interpretation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The definition of bodily harm was introduced into the <i>Criminal Code</i> in 1983: See <span
class=GramE><i>An</i></span><i> Act to Amend the Criminal Code in relation
    to sexual offences and other offences against the person</i>, S.C.
    1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 19. Prior to 1983, the definition was a matter of
    common law. Canadian courts adopted the English definition set out in <i>R. v. Donovan</i>, [1934] 2 K.B. 498 (C.A.),
    at p. 507:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For this purpose we think that bodily harm has its
    ordinary meaning and includes any hurt or injury calculated interfere with the
    health or comfort of the prosecutor. Such hurt or injury need not be permanent,
    but must, no doubt, be more than merely transient <i>and </i>trifling. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See also <i>R. v. Maloney</i> (1976), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 323 (Ont. Co. Ct.), at p. 326.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In adding a statutory definition to the <i>Criminal Code</i>, Parliament changed the
    common-law formulation from transient <i>and</i> trifling to transient <i>or</i> trifling.
    However, there is no indication in the legislative debates that Parliament
    intended to change the meaning of the common-law formulation. On the contrary, the
    legislative committee that considered the predecessor to the 1983 Act was
    expressly told by senior Department of Justice officials that the new
    definition merely followed the common law: See Canada, House of Commons, 32nd
    Parl., 1st Sess., <i>Proceedings of the
    Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, </i>No. 97 (June 15, 1982), at
    p. 56. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the common law formulation of the
    definition does not share the same ambiguity as the statutory formulation. Read
    positively, in order to constitute bodily harm under the common law formulation,
    a hurt or injury that interferes with the comfort or safety of a person
    constitutes bodily harm if it is more than either merely transient or more than
    merely trifling. Similarly, focussing on what is excluded from bodily harm
    under the common law formulation, a hurt or injury must be transient <i>and</i> trifling to be excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, this interpretation is consistent with case law
    that has recognized that injuries of short duration may still be of significant
    gravity. For example in <i>R. v. Garrett</i> (1995), 169 A.R. 394, the Alberta Court of Appeal allowed an appeal on the
    basis that the trial judge appeared in finding that injuries had healed within
    one week were of insufficient duration to constitute bodily harm. The court
    noted that a life-threatening injury may indeed be of short duration but
    nevertheless constitute bodily harm. It makes sense that such injuries cross
    the threshold of bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that in the absence of expert
    evidence it was not open to the trial judge to find that the unconsciousness
    experienced by the complainant amounted to bodily harm. I agree that it may
    have been preferable for the Crown to call expert evidence concerning this
    issue. However, even assuming that it was open to the trial judge to make a
    finding of bodily harm based on the record before her, I am not persuaded that
    the Crown is entitled to rely on bodily harm to support a conviction on the
    sexual assault charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the complainant consented to
    the appellant choking her into unconsciousness. However, the appellant was
    charged with sexual assault <i>simpliciter</i> and not with sexual assault causing bodily harm. Bodily harm is not an element
    of the offence of sexual assault. In effect, the Crown did not formally allege
    that the complainant suffered bodily harm that would vitiate the complainants
    consent to sexual activity. Rather, the Crown alleged that the complainant did
    not consent to the sexual activity that formed the subject matter of the sexual
    assault charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the absence of a request to amend the indictment to
    charge sexual assault causing bodily harm either here or in the court below, I
    fail to see how the Crown is entitled to rely on bodily harm to vitiate the
    complainant's consent to erotic asphyxiation.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 69 of
    her reasons, states that after her review of the authorities and the relevant
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    there is no basis for holding that as a matter of general principle, a person
    cannot legally consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while
    the person is either unconscious or asleep.  She goes on to say that in her view, if anything  the relevant case
    law supports the opposite conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, it is only this portion of her thorough
    and persuasive analysis that I disagree with.  Specifically, I take the opposite view of the interpretation of relevant
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and
    relevant jurisprudence.  As a
    consequence, this takes me to a different result on this appeal.  In my view the appeal should be
    dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For purposes of my analysis, I begin with my
    agreement of my colleagues holding at para. 55: the evidence that was led at
    trial was simply not capable of supporting a finding that the complainant did
    not consent on a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The only question
    that remains therefore is whether the complainants consent is valid in
    law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties frame the issue as being whether a person
    can consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while the person is
    unconscious.  In the context of this
    case, however, the issue is more accurately described as whether a person can
    consent in advance to sexual activity that is expected to occur after the person
    has been <span class=SpellE>chocked</span> into unconsciousness by a sexual
    partner.  Regardless, I would answer no
    to the question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, my opinion is that a person cannot consent
    in advance to sexual activity after being <span class=SpellE>chocked</span> into unconsciousness because it does not fit within the concept of consent to
    sexual contact as that concept has been interpreted in <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>In my view, the Crown is
    correct in that </span><i>Ewanchuk</i> conclusively establishes that a prior consent is not effective as a matter of
    law because unconsciousness deprives the person consenting of the ability to
    express consent or know whether they are consenting at the time the sexual
    activity occurs.  An examination of some
    of the relevant jurisprudence, similar to that carried out by the trial judge,
    supports this.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge observed, in <i>R. v. Jobidon</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714 the Supreme Court of Canada made
    it clear that although the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides some definition of the concept of consent, it is not an
    all-encompassing definition and the common law has a continuing role to play in
    establishing the legal effectiveness of consent in cases of assault.  In particular, she noted that in <i>Jobidon</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    concluded that the common law has created a body of law which illuminates the
    meaning of consent, and places limitations on the legal effectiveness of
    consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although <i>Jobidon</i> dealt with consensual fights, the Supreme Court of Canada expressly
    contemplated that further limitations would be found in other types of cases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just as the Supreme Court of Canada formulated
    limitations on the effectiveness of consent in the context of a fistfight, so
    too it has formulated limitations on the effectiveness of consent in sexual
    assault cases.  In <i>Ewanchuk</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized that the absence
    of consent as an element of the offence of sexual assault is a subjective
    question to be determined by reference to the complainant's subjective
    internal state of mind towards the touching, <i>at the time it occurred</i> (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted by my colleague, the trial judge, at para. 40
    of her reasons relied heavily on the Court of Appeal of Albertas majority
    decision in <i>R. v. Ashlee</i> [2006] A.J.
    No. 1040.  In <i>Ashlee</i> the court squarely addressed the following question of law:
    can a person, while competent, consent to being sexually touched while asleep
    or unconscious?  The majority concluded
    that a person could not.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority in <i>Ashlee</i> said that the answer to the question turns on the proper interpretation of s.
    273.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, specifically, what Parliament intended when
    it <span class=SpellE>negatived</span> consent under s. 273.1(2)(b) where the
    complainant is incapable of consenting.  It is useful at this time to restate the relevant <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>273.1(1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection
    265(3), consent means, for the purposes of sections 271 [sexual assault], 272
    [sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third person or causing bodily
    harm] and 273 [aggravated sexual assault], the voluntary agreement of the
    complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>273.1 (2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes
    of sections 271, 272 and 273, where&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=GramE>the</span> complainant is incapable of consenting to the
    activity;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;<span class=GramE>the</span> complainant, having consented to engage in
    sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to
    continue to engage in the activity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the majority in <i>Ashlee</i> noted, the plain wording of s. 273.1(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>e)
    is explicit; consent is revocable once given.  That is, the complainant is entitled to withdraw consent at any
    time.  From this it can be implied that
    consent is an ongoing state of mind, and therefore ends as soon as the
    complainant falls unconscious and is incapable of consenting.  Prior consent is insufficient. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the only possible way to find that a
    person who is lying unconscious is consenting to sexual activity is to imply
    this consent from their prior behaviour.  U<span style='color:black'>nlike the situation that may exist in other
    forms of human interaction, implied consent is not a doctrine that can be
    applied to sexual assault:  <i>Ewanchuk</i>,<i> </i>at para. 31.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge in our case correctly noted
    that the issue of prior consent has been addressed by our courts.  For example, McLachlin J. (as she then was)
    in <i>R. v. Esau</i> [1997] 2
    S.C.R. 777, at para. 73, identified that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Consent involves capable, deliberate, and voluntary
    agreement to or concurrence.&nbsp; A person who is unconscious or unable to
    communicate is incapable of indicating deliberate voluntary agreement.&nbsp; At
    issue, as elsewhere in dealing with consent, is the social act of communicating
    consent, not the internal state of mind of the complainant.&nbsp; An accused is
    not entitled to presume consent <i>in the
    absence of communicative ability</i>.&nbsp; The complainant in this category
    lacks the capacity to communicate a voluntary decision to consent.&nbsp;   To put it another way, the necessary (but not
    sufficient) condition of consent&nbsp;-- the capacity to communicate agreement
    --&nbsp;is absent.&nbsp; <i>The hypothetical
    case of a complainant giving advance consent to sexual contact before becoming
    unconscious&nbsp;does not constitute an exception. Consent can be revoked at
    any time.&nbsp; The person who assaults an unconscious woman cannot know
    whether, were she conscious, she would&nbsp;revoke the earlier
    consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; He therefore takes the risk that she may later claim she
    was assaulted without consent. </i>[Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that McLachlin Js. <span
class=GramE>comments</span> were made in respect of an unconscious complainant
    in the context of the defence of honest but mistaken belief.  Nevertheless, there is no reason that I can
    perceive to confine her comments to that defence, nor is there any reason to
    conclude she intended such limits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, McLachlin J in <i>Esau</i> would have excluded the defence of honest but mistaken belief
    from being put to the jury in that case.  Her reasoning was that the complainant was heavily intoxicated at the
    time the defendant alleged she had consented.  Because she was incapable of consenting, there could have been no
    mistaken belief in consent.  This line of
    reasoning is dependent on the above definition of consent.  Once again, as the majority in <i>Ashlee</i> noted, her comments are
    consistent with s. 273.1(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>e) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and with the principle recognized in <i>Ewanchuk</i> that consent is revocable at any time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court in <i>R. v. Humphrey<b> </b></i><a name=reflex-caselaw-52982190></a>(2001),
    143 O.A.C. 151 (C.A.), at para. <span class=GramE>56,</span> held that it was
    an error for a trial judge not to remind the jury of his earlier instruction
    that consent meant the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the
    sexual activity in question and that there could be no consent if she was
    unconscious.  The Crown in that case
    contended that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant while
    she was unconscious; the accused maintained that although the complainant had
    consented to intercourse, it never took place because the complainant passed
    out.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, Charron J.A. writing for the court in <i>Humphrey</i>, went on in the same paragraph
    to make the following comments:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Hence, even if consent had been given earlier, it
    would cease at the time the complainant became unconscious.  If the sexual activity continued after the
    complainant was unconscious, there would be no consent, and the focus would
    shift to the accuseds knowledge that consent had ceased.  </p>

style='line-height:200%;color:black'>Furthermore, the
    meaning of s. 273.1 was also in issue in <i>Humphry</i>.  In referring to this section, Charron J.A.
    held at para. 38 that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury when he
    told them that:</span></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=apple-style-span><span style='color:black'> <span class=GramE>consent</span> means the voluntary
    agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question and
    that no consent is obtained if the complainant is incapable of consenting to
    the activity.  To clarify things, he
    told the jury that you cannot consent if you are unconscious. <i>The law requires consent that is conscious
    and continuous, i.e., during all acts</i>.  <i>The consciousness must be
    continuous</i>. [Emphasis added]</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once again, while the context in which the above
    comments were made differs from that in this appeal, there is no reason to
    reject their application in the broader context.  The comments are unambiguous and, as in <i>Esau</i> and <i>Ashlee</i>, they are consistent with s. 273.1(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and with the principle recognized in <i>Ewanchuk</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that because an unconscious person is
    incapable of making a rational choice to consent to sexual activity at the time
    it occurs<i> </i>and because it cannot be
    implied that a consent previously given continues to be operative while the
    person is unconscious, a person cannot in law consent in advance to sexual activity
    expected to occur after the person is chocked into unconsciousness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague notes in para. 78 that at para. 28 of <i>Ewanchuk</i>, Major J. observed that
    [h]aving control over who touches one's body, and how, lies at the core of
    human dignity and autonomy and that protecting individuals security of the
    person lies at the heart of [t]he inclusion of assault and sexual assault in
    the [<i>Criminal</i>] <i>Code</i>. Consequently my colleague concludes that permitting a person
    to consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious or
    asleep is entirely consistent with this principle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first blush, there is a superficial appeal to my
    colleagues assertion  that permitting a
    person to consent in advance to sexual activity that is to take place while
    unconscious or asleep is consistent with that persons autonomous control over
    who touches ones body and how.  This is
    especially tempting when considering the illustration m<span style='color:black'>y
    colleague recites; that prohibiting sexual touching which occurs while ones
    partner is unconscious would have the effect of criminalizing the behaviour of
    a person who touches their partner in a sexual way while their partner is
    sleeping.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my respectful view, however, a closer examination
    reveals the opposite.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the heart of this matter are individual autonomy and
    individual choice to protect the dignity of the individual and the security of
    the individuals person.  Autonomy is the
    capacity to exercise choice free of restraint, unfettered by control and absent
    interference.  It belongs to the
    individual and cannot be assumed by or delegated to another.  The autonomous operating will of the
    individual is negated by unconsciousness; there simply is no active operating
    will while the individual is asleep or unconscious.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In both the common law and statute law
    applicable to sexual assault, choice and autonomy are active and oriented to
    the present; to the here and to the now.  Consent is the autonomous choice of the individual.  Consent ends when the active independent personal
    operating will ceases.  Indeed, this is
    precisely what is being expressed in the jurisprudence, in my view.  Thus, I must respectfully disagree with my
    colleague when she holds that <span style='color:black'>consent in advance to
    sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious or asleep is entirely
    consistent with this principle</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before concluding, I would make two final brief
    observations in respect of the principle of autonomy and the example used to
    illustrate it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Canadian law has long since abolished the notion
    of differing categories of victims in sexual assault cases.  Victims, whether spouses of or strangers to
    the accused, are entitled to the same protections of the law.  I acknowledge that cases such as <i>Ewanchuk </i>and <i>Esau</i> addressed factual situations that are different from the
    present case.  I concede that the
    application of these rules may seem unduly harsh in certain hypothetical
    situations not before this court.  However, I believe that these cases nonetheless set down broadly defined
    rules and principles that are applicable and binding on this court.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in my view Parliament has expressed its clear
    view of the law regarding consent in the context of sexual activity; a person
    cannot consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no basis, in my view, for departing from the
    principles enunciated in <i>Ewanchuk</i> in
    the circumstances of this case.  The
    complainant was not in a position to exercise her right of choice  autonomous
    control over who touches her body and how - at the time the sexual activity of
    anal penetration with a dildo was occurring.  Her consent was negated when she was chocked into unconscious.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a new trial of an assault charge based
    on the trial judges failure to consider the impact of the complainants
    injuries on his finding of inferred consent. However, the court did not
    specifically address the question of whether the issue properly arises on a
