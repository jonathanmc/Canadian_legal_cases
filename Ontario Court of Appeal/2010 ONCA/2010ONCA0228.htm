  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Securities Commission (the “Commission”)
    appeals from the decision of the application judge, Wilton-Siegel J., not to
    continue directions made by the Commission under s. 126 of the <i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, to
    freeze two offshore funds held in Toronto by a fund-holding agent, Newedge
    Canada Inc. (the “Offshore Directions”). The Commission asks this court to
    approve a new legal test to be applied by a court when deciding under s. 126(5)
    whether to continue freeze directions made by the Commission under s. 126(1).</p>
  <h3>Factual Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The named respondent parties in this application are
    not the owners of the funds targeted by the Offshore Directions that the
    Commission seeks to have continued in the instant appeal. They are Canadian
    entities owned or controlled by the same man who owns or controls the targeted
    funds, Otto Spork (the “Sextant Canadian entities”). The targeted funds are the
    Sextant Strategic Hybrid<sup>2</sup>Hedge Resource Fund Offshore Ltd. (the
    “Sextant Hybrid Fund”), and the Sextant Strategic Global Water Fund Offshore
    Ltd. (the “Sextant Water Fund”), together referred to as the “Offshore Funds”
    or the “Funds”. The Offshore Funds were incorporated under the laws of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Cayman Islands and have a stated net asset value of
    approximately U.S. $100 million. Importantly for this proceeding, according to
    the Notice of Application, they have no Canadian investors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accounts of the Sextant Canadian entities held in
    Ontario were also frozen by the Commission and those freeze directions were
    continued by order of the Superior Court under s. 126(5) of the <i>Securities Act</i>. Subsequently, at the
    request of the Commission, a Receiver of the Sextant Canadian entities was
    appointed because of perceived fraud in the operation of those entities and the
    fear that their funds would be removed from Ontario by Mr. Spork if they were
    not protected. The Receiver did not take part in this appeal, having determined,
    after examining the records of the entities under <span class=GramE>receivership,
    that</span> it did not appear to have any interest in the Offshore Funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commission’s concern with respect to all of the
    Spork entities arose out of a class proceeding brought by Squirrel Trust No. 1. <span class=GramE>on</span> behalf of non-Canadian investors in the Offshore
    Funds, where a <i>Mareva</i> injunction was
    sought to protect the monies held by the Offshore Funds in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario from dissipation, pending the class
    action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wilton-Siegel J. heard the two applications, one for
    the <i>Mareva</i> injunction in the class
    action and the other by the Commission for an order continuing the Offshore
    Directions, on two consecutive days. On February 27, 2009, he released his
    reasons granting the <i>Mareva </i>injunction.
    On March 2, 2009, he released his reasons declining to continue the Offshore
    Directions.</p>
  <h3>The <i>Mareva</i> Injunction Application</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The basis of the class action claim was that while the
    Offshore Funds had exercised a forced redemption of the Class A and Class F
    shares held by the Squirrel Trust No. 1 as of September 30, 2008, they had not
    followed through with that redemption. The assets in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario were insufficient to satisfy any
    judgment in respect of the redemption of the shares. The basis for the <i>Mareva</i> injunction application was that
    the value of the Offshore Funds had been falsely inflated in a manner I will
    explain below, in order to allow another Spork entity to pay itself significant
    performance-based management fees. There was therefore a serious concern that
    the Offshore Funds would continue to be dissipated by Spork if they were not
    protected by a court-ordered injunction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In applying the respective steps of the <i>Mareva </i>test, the application judge first
    concluded that the plaintiff class had made out a strong <i>prima facie</i> case that the Offshore Funds were legally required to
    redeem the shares in the Squirrel Trust No. 1. <span class=GramE>at</span> the
    price and in accordance with the forced redemption action that they took on
    September 30, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, the application judge considered whether there
    was a genuine risk of dissipation of the assets of the Offshore Funds held in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario by Newedge. The
    evidence of the risk of dissipation took several forms and is important for
    understanding the Commission’s concern regarding the operation of the Offshore
    Funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first matter relied on was Spork’s attempt to
    transfer U.S. $220,000 from the Sextant Hybrid Fund account at Newedge to
    another Sextant Hybrid Fund account at the Bank of Bermuda, also managed by the
    manager of the Offshore Funds, another Spork company called Sextant Capital
    Management a Islandi ehf (the “Manager”), an Icelandic corporation. This
    attempted transfer was made in the face of the class action proceeding and
    shortly after the funds in the accounts of the Sextant Canadian entities had
    been frozen by the Commission. The application judge found this sufficient, in
    the absence of a business explanation for the transfer, to establish a
    significant risk of dissipation of the assets in the Offshore Funds accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second matter was the calculation and payment of
    the performance fees based on the inflated values attributed by Spork to the
    Offshore Funds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following is the background to the values. Each of
    the Offshore Funds made a significant investment in two private Luxemburg entities
    founded by Spork: Iceland Glacier Products S.a.r.l. (“IGP”), and Iceland Global
    Water 2 Partners SCA (“IGW”).<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> IGP <span class=GramE>had</span> no revenue-producing business operations and
    no current assets other than an alleged 95-year exclusive lease to take water
    from a glacier in Iceland for commercial sale; nor was there evidence of any
    prospect for revenue-producing business operations in the future. Notwithstanding
    these facts, the Offshore Funds ascribed a market value of $226 million to IGP
    as of November 28, 2008. The application judge rejected the evidence tendered
    on behalf of the Offshore Funds that purported to be third-party valuations
    that supported the alleged value. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offering memoranda of the Offshore Funds provided
    that the Manager was to be paid performance fees monthly in an amount equal to
    20% of the increase in value of the “Class Net Asset Values” of the Class A and
    Class F shares of the Offshore Funds since the previous month-end<span
style='line-height:200%'>. F</span>rom June 2007 to
    November 2008 the net asset values of <span class=GramE>the</span> two
    Offshore Funds were alleged to have increased by 506% and 519.2% respectively,
    and performance fees were paid based on those increases. The increases were
    essentially attributable to the increase in market value of the IGP shares held
    by the two funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the market value of
    the IGP shares was not justifiable. To the contrary, he found that there was no
    evidence that the value of the IGP shares was anything other than the value of
    the investment by the Offshore Funds in IGP to purchase those shares.
    Therefore, there was no basis for the payment of the performance fees during
    2007 and 2008. The application judge concluded that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The facts demonstrate a clear propensity on the
    part of these parties ... to appropriate assets of the Funds to the detriment
    of the shareholders of the Funds. The evidence indicates that the Manager and
    Spork have pursued a course of action that involved furthering the interests of
    IGP at the expense of honouring their fiduciary and contractual obligations to
    the shareholders of the Funds, including any judgment that may hereafter be
    obtained in this proceeding. These circumstances therefore establish a genuine
    risk that assets of the Funds will be dissipated in the absence of the
    requested relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that he would grant the requested <i>Mareva</i> injunction, the application judge
    made two further observations about the operation of the Spork entities based
    on the evidence before him that further supported his conclusion. The first was
    that the Offshore Funds’ investment in IGP and IGW was disproportionate
    relative to the total assets of the funds and could not be justified “as
    reasonable investments under recognized investment criteria on the record
    before the Court.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second significant observation by the application
    judge was that the Offshore Funds, along with the Sextant Strategic
    Opportunities Hedge Fund L.P. (the “Canadian Hedge Fund”) “have essentially
    become funding vehicles for IGP and IGW” and that those companies could not
    have conducted any business activities in 2007 and 2008 without the investments
    by the Offshore Funds and the Canadian Hedge Fund. Finally, as the benefit of
    these investments accrued to Spork as the only other substantial shareholder of
    IGP and IGW, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[t]he evidence therefore suggests a serious
    likelihood that Spork would cause the Funds to direct any remaining monies in
    the Funds’ accounts to IGP to attempt to preserve the value of his investment
    in IGP.</p>
  <h3>The Commission Application for an Extension of
    the Offshore Directions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second application before the application
    judge was for an order pursuant to s.&nbsp;126(5) of the <i>Securities Act</i> to continue directions issued by the Commission on
    December 17, 2008 to freeze the Offshore Funds. To understand properly the
    process that the <i>Securities Act</i> provides for the Commission to issue directions to freeze certain assets and
    for the Superior Court to continue those directions by order, <span
style='line-height:200%'>I find it convenient to recite
    the relevant provisions of s. 126:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'>126<span class=GramE>.(</span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Commission considers it

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>the Commission may direct a person or company
    having on deposit or under its control or for safekeeping any funds, securities
    or property of any person or company to retain those funds, securities or
    property and to hold them until the Commission in writing revokes the direction
    or consents to release a particular fund, security or property from the
    direction, or until the Superior Court of Justice orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as practicable and not
    later than seven days after a direction is issued under subsection (1), the
    Commission shall apply to the Superior Court of Justice to continue the
    direction or for such other order as the court considers appropriate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;A direction under subsection
    (1) may be made without notice but, in that event, copies of the direction
    shall be sent forthwith by such means as the Commission may determine to all
    persons and companies named in the direction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;A person or company directly

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge used the test first established
    by Farley J. in <i>Ontario Securities
    Commission v. RBC Dominion Securities Inc. </i>(2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 767 (S.C.),
    to be applied by the Superior Court when determining whether to continue
    directions of the Commission to freeze funds. It is a three-part test similar
    to the test for a <i>Mareva</i> injunction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a strong <i>prima
    facie</i> case or a serious issue to be tried, as to whether there has been a
    contravention of the <i>Securities Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a close connection between the alleged misconduct and
    the frozen assets; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>evidence</span> of potential
    dissipation of assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first issue was whether the Commission could point
    to any breach of the <i>Securities Act</i> by or in relation to the Offshore Funds. The Commission was initially relying
    on alleged breaches of s. 111 of the<i> Act </i>by
    the Canadian Hedge Fund but by the time of the application, it could not link
    any such alleged breaches to the Offshore Funds. Similarly, the Commission was
    also initially relying on questions regarding the propriety of certain payments
    by the Canadian Hedge Fund into the Sextant Water Fund, but again, the
    Commission could not identify any breach of the<i> Act </i>relating to the payments. Accordingly, on the hearing of the
    application, the Commission was relying on only two grounds that it submitted
    could satisfy the first part of the <i>RBC</i> test and justify continuation of the Offshore Directions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first ground was based on a January 2009 e-mail
    request received from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, stating that there
    may be some breaches of the Cayman Islands laws by the Offshore Funds and
    requesting continuation of the Offshore Directions on that basis under s. 126(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b). The application judge rejected the extension order on
    this ground. First, he found that as the original Offshore Directions had been
    made under s. 126(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a), they could not be continued
    on a totally new ground under s. 126(1)(b). Second, the vague, non-specific
    allegations of breach made by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority were not
    sufficient to meet the first or second prongs of the <i>RBC</i> test and to ground an order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground was based on two alleged
    misrepresentations or untrue statements concerning the Offshore Funds, which
    were said to constitute breaches of s.&nbsp;126.2 of the <i>Securities Act</i>.  That
    provision states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>126.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A person or company shall not make a statement that the
    person or company knows or reasonably ought to know,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)    in a material respect and at the time and in the light of the
    circumstances under which it is made, is misleading or untrue or does not state
    a fact that is required to be stated or that is necessary to make the statement
    not misleading; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)    <span class=GramE>would</span> reasonably be expected to have a
    significant effect on the market price or value of a security.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first allegation was that the net asset values of
    the shares of the Offshore Funds that were set out in Internet-posted
    performance charts for the Funds to September, 2008 were misleading. The
    application judge agreed that the net asset values could indeed be <span
class=GramE>misleading,</span> based on his findings in the Squirrel Trust No.
    1 application relating to the underlying value of IGP. However, the Commission
    conceded that no Canadian residents owned shares in the Funds, and therefore
    there was a serious issue whether any breach of the<i> Act </i>had occurred. Furthermore, regarding the second branch of the
    test, the Commission had not established any connection between the alleged
    misrepresentations and any monies in the accounts or that any investor had
    acquired shares based on the performance charts. In that regard, the evidence
    was that a password was required to access these charts on the Manager’s
    website.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second allegation of misrepresentation or untrue
    statements was that the offering memoranda of the Offshore Funds did not
    disclose that 50% of the assets of each of the Funds would be invested in IGP
    and IGW, two start-up companies in the water business associated with Spork,
    the founder of the Offshore Funds. The application judge concluded that this
    ground as well did not meet the <i>RBC</i> test. First, he found that there was no clear misrepresentation based on the
    wording of the offering memoranda, which did state that the investments would
    be in the water business, nor did they identify ratios of proposed public
    versus private investments. Second, even if the disclosure was untrue at the
    date of the application, there was no evidence that the statements in the
    offering memoranda were untrue when they were made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge was also of the view that to
    succeed on the second branch of the <i>RBC</i> test, a sufficiently close connection between the alleged breaches and the
    Funds must be established by showing that one or more investors relied on
    specific misrepresentations in the offering memoranda when they made the
    decision to buy shares in the Funds and that the subscription proceeds were
    deposited into the frozen accounts. The Commission asked the court to draw the
    inference that some investors were misled and that their subscription monies
    were paid into the frozen accounts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected this submission because
    it did not meet the standard of proof required by the <i>RBC</i> test. Given that <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 126 freeze order
    is an extraordinary remedy involving the seizure of assets prior to the
    completion of an investigation by the Commission, the standard of proof
    requires at least a serious issue to be tried regarding a specific breach. In
    this case, drawing the inference that an unspecified investor was misled at
    some unspecified time could not amount to such a serious issue.</p>
  <h3>Issues</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises four issues:</p>
  <p>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether this court should approve the <i>RBC</i> standard for a court to apply on a
    s. 126(5) application or accept the submission of the Commission that the
    standard should be “contextual reasonableness” and, if so, whether the
    application judge erred by failing to apply that standard.  </p>
  <p>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    alternative, whether the application judge erred in his application of the <i>RBC</i> test.  </p>
  <p>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the
    further alternative, whether the application judge erred in failing to find
    misleading or untrue statements capable of constituting a breach of s. 126.2 of
    the <i>Act</i>. </p>
  <p>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the Offshore Directions should be continued.</p>

  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(1)       The standard to be applied for continuing a direction to
    freeze accounts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislative mandate under consideration is
    contained in ss. 126(1) and (5) of the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, which I recite again for ease of reference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>126<span
class=GramE>.(</span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
    the Commission considers it expedient,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>for</span> the due
    administration of Ontario securities law or the regulation of the capital
    markets in Ontario; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>to</span> assist in the due
    administration of the securities laws or the regulation of the capital markets
    in another jurisdiction,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>the Commission may direct a person or company
    having on deposit or under its control or for safekeeping any funds, securities
    or property of any person or company to retain those funds, securities or
    property and to hold them until the Commission in writing revokes the direction
    or consents to release a particular fund, security or property from the
    direction, or until the Superior Court of Justice orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as practicable and not
    later than seven days after a direction is issued under subsection (1), the
    Commission shall apply to the Superior Court of Justice to continue the
    direction or for such other order as the court considers appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intent of s. 126(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) is
    to give the Commission the power to act quickly to preserve property as soon as
    it has concerns about the possible dissipation of that property out of Ontario,
    and to do so based on a standard of expediency “for the due administration of
    Ontario securities law or the regulation of the capital markets in Ontario”.
    Clearly the standard of proof for the Commission to issue freeze directions is
    very low, as it is anticipated that the Commission staff may only be commencing
    an investigation when they believe a direction is necessary. However, having
    acted with expedience, the Commission must then seek a court order within seven
    days, to continue the freeze and to be able to complete the investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection (5) does not use the term “expedient”. In
    fact, the wording of the section gives little guidance as to the standard the
    court is to apply when determining whether to continue the freeze. The
    Commission has explained in its factum that the purpose of inserting a court
    continuance process into the legislative scheme in the 1994 amendments was to
    ensure that a continuing order is made in accordance with <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <h3><i>The Commission’s Position</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that when s. 126 is read as a
    whole, including the ability of an affected person to apply to the Commission
    under s. 126(7) for clarification or to vary or revoke its directions, and that
    that decision can be appealed to the Divisional Court under s. 9(1), “it is
    apparent that s. 126(5) was not intended to substitute the court for the
    Commission, but only to ensure a mechanism for court consideration of the
    issuance of the direction.” The appellant proposes that the proper role for the
    court is to also apply the expediency standard when deciding whether to continue
    a freeze order under s.&nbsp;126(5) by considering whether it is reasonable on
    the evidence for the court to conclude that it is expedient to continue the
    Commission’s direction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that applying such a “contextual
    reasonableness standard” would allow the court to consider all relevant factors,
    including the stage of the Commission’s investigation, the strength of the
    evidence, whether a proceeding has been initiated and any other circumstances.</p>
  <h3><i>Analysis</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commission is seeking to displace the three-part
    test propounded in 2001 in <i>Ontario
    Securities Commission v. RBC Dominion Securities</i>.<i> </i>I will set out the test again here for ease of reference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a strong <i>prima
    facie</i> case or a serious issue to be tried, as to whether there has been a
    contravention of the <i>Securities Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a close connection between the alleged misconduct and
    the frozen assets; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>evidence</span> of potential
    dissipation of assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, the courts that have discussed or applied
    the test have not insisted on a rigid application of the test but have imported
    a measure of flexibility. In <i>RBC</i> itself, where Farley J. was faced with interpreting and applying s. 126(5) for
    the first time, he stated, at para. 13, that the test for a <i>Mareva</i> injunction was a useful guide but
    “with some adjustments.” For example, the strength of the <i>prima facie</i> case of breach of the<i> Act </i>required to continue a freeze of funds may depend on whether
    the freeze would interfere with the operation of the account in question—if the
    account could continue to operate, then a lesser case based on circumstantial
    evidence could suffice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The flexibility of the test was remarked on by Pepall
    J. in <i>Ontario Securities Commission v.
    von Anhalt</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 247, a cease-trading order case under s. 128(4)
    of the <i>Act</i>. In rejecting the need for
    a strong <i>prima facie</i> case for an
    order under s. 128(4), Pepall J. commented, at para. 16, that the freeze order
    under s. 126 is a more onerous order than the cease trade order, but that even
    under s. 126(5), Farley J. in <i>RBC</i> had
    made it clear that a strong <i>prima facie</i> case of breach of the<i> Act </i>would not
    be required in every case depending on the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last case before this one to consider the test
    under s. 126(5) was <i>Ontario Securities
    Commission v. De Freitas &amp; Associates</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 2020, another
    decision of Wilton-Siegel J. In that case, the court noted again that in <i>RBC</i>, Farley J. had anticipated the
    ability to apply a flexible standard regarding the strength of the <i>prima facie</i> case required.  However, in <i>De Freitas</i>, the court decided that a strong <i>prima facie</i> case of breach was required: <i>De Freitas</i> at paras. 28-31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, although the jurisprudence under this
    section is limited, the <i>RBC</i> test that
    has been articulated and applied is cogent, fair and effective. It sets out a
    standard against which a court may test the evidence presented to it and based
    on which the court is asked to impose a very onerous order that freezes assets
    of a corporation operating in the financial markets in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the submission of the Commission, the court
    is not being asked to approve the Commission’s Offshore Directions or to review
    them to determine whether it was expedient for the Commission to make them in
    the first instance. Instead, the court is asked to make an order to continue
    the temporary Offshore Directions into the future, based on the record before
    it. Clearly a court needs criteria to apply in order to determine whether to
    make any order, and the affected parties also need to know the factors that
    will affect their position. This is quite different from the original
    directions of the Commission that can be made without notice and served on the
    affected parties thereafter: s. 126(6).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the <i>RBC</i> three-part test provides appropriate criteria for a court to consider when
    determining whether to continue freeze directions under s. 126(5). I am also of
    the view that the test is to be applied in a flexible manner with the required
    strength of proof of each component of the test dependent on the circumstances
    of the particular case. This would include not only the <i>prima facie</i> case or serious issue to be tried of breach of the Act,
    but also the link between the wrongdoing and the targeted fund. This is also
    the approach taken under the British Columbia and Alberta legislation, which
    provide a different procedure but seek to accomplish the same objective: see,
    for example, <i>Klytie’s Development Inc.
    (Re), </i>2006 ABASC 1763; <i>Workum (Re)</i>,
    2005 ABASC 425.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

  <h3>(2)       Error by the application
    judge in applying the test</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the evidence relied on
    by the Commission in this case did not establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of breach of the <i>Act</i> or a sufficient connection between the alleged wrongdoing and
    the Funds. The Commission argues on this appeal that a breach of the <i>Act</i> is not a necessary requirement for a
    freeze order, and that the order should be issued where there is evidence of
    wrongful misappropriation of funds after they are invested, in order to protect
    investors generally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although at first blush this argument may appear
    attractive, on closer consideration, it does not bear scrutiny. The purpose of
    a freeze direction is to give the Commission time to investigate alleged
    wrongdoing under the <i>Securities Act</i> with a view to the Commission instituting proceedings under the<i> Act </i>in respect of that wrongdoing. The
    Commission’s jurisdiction flows from the <i>Act</i>.
    If the alleged wrongdoing cannot lead to any proceeding under the<i> Act</i>, then the freeze order would amount
    to a remedy in itself, and not a mechanism to preserve assets pending a proper
    proceeding under the<i> Act </i>with
    prescribed remedies upon proof of breach of the<i> Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No case presented, including cases from other
    provinces, suggests that an apparent breach of the<i> Act </i>is not required as a first criterion for a freeze order. The
    application judge correctly required at least a <i>prima facie</i> case of breach of the<i> Act</i>. I also note that on the application hearing, the Commission
    itself recognized that it had to show evidence of a breach of the<i> Act</i>, and narrowed its arguments once it
    became apparent that some of its alleged breaches could not be established. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also observe that in its evidence, the Commission’s
    representative stated that Commission staff intended to amend a Statement of
    Allegations originally issued on December 8, 2008, in support of a temporary
    cease trade order that the Commission issued against the respondents. He swore
    in an affidavit on January 12, 2009, that staff intended to amend the statement
    “to include allegations with respect to the wrongful activity undertaken in
    Ontario in connection with the Sextant Offshore Funds.” However, the record
    does not contain any amended statement or indicate that such amendments have,
    in fact, been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another reason for the application judge’s refusal to
    continue the Offshore Directions was because the evidence did not establish a
    link from the alleged misrepresentations in the performance charts and the
    offering memoranda to the Offshore Funds. He required the Commission to prove
    that an identifiable investor made his or her investment based on one of the
    alleged misrepresentations and that the invested funds were in the frozen
    accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge may well have been
    too stringent in his approach to the requirements of the second branch of the
    test. For example, had there been sufficient evidence of a breach of the<i> Act</i>, it may have been sufficient for
    the Commission to have been able to show that identifiable investors who had
    access to the impugned misrepresentations, whether or not they relied on them,
    invested in the Funds thereafter and that their investment monies were at some
    point in the frozen accounts. Arguably, such an investor should be protected
    pending the Commission investigation, even if the actual monies he or she
    invested had already been wrongfully removed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having said that, I see no error in the result reached
    by the application judge in this case. He was well aware of the serious
    wrongdoing that appeared to be the <i>modus
    operandi</i> of Spork in the operation of all of his related Sextant entities,
    and he was prepared to give an appropriate interim remedy in the Squirrel Trust
    No. 1 action. He was, however, not satisfied that the evidence presented by the
    Commission amounted to anything more than general concern about the operation
    of funds held in Ontario, which was not sufficiently linked to the enforcement
    jurisdiction of the Commission to allow the court to continue the Offshore
    Directions under s. 126(5) of the <i>Act</i>.
    The Commission argues on the appeal that because the Funds are operated from
    Ontario, that should be a sufficient link. I agree with the application judge’s
    reason for rejecting this assertion.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(3)       Error
    by the application judge in his findings on the evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also see no palpable and overriding error by the
    application judge in his conclusion that he was not prepared to interpret the
    offering memoranda as misleading at the time they were issued.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]</span></span></span></a> This was a conclusion that was open to him on the record. The Commission also
    argues that that conclusion was not consistent with the judge’s observation in
    the <i>Mareva</i> injunction ruling that the
    offering memoranda did not state that the Offshore Funds would invest
    disproportionately in IPG and IPW. I do not see any inconsistency. The
    application judge did not go so far as to say that the failure of the offering
    memoranda to state that monies would be disproportionately invested amounted to
    a misrepresentation. Rather, his conclusion was focused on the fact that such
    an investment could not be justified as reasonable based on recognized
    investment criteria. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision reached by the application judge not to
    continue the Offshore Directions also made practical sense in the
    circumstances, where the only known investors whose monies were in the Offshore
    Funds held in Ontario were already protected by the <i>Mareva</i> injunction in the Squirrel Trust No. 1 action.</p>
  <h3>(4)       Should the Offshore Directions
    be continued</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the argument in this matter,
    counsel for the appellant confirmed that as long as the <i>Mareva</i> injunction in the Squirrel Trust No. 1 action <span class=GramE>continued</span> in place, that order had the same effect in this case as a freeze order under
    s.&nbsp;126 of the <i>Act</i>. He further
    confirmed that an arrangement had been made for the Commission to receive
    notice if the <i>Mareva</i> injunction were
    to be lifted and in that event, the Commission would seek new freeze directions
    under s. 126(1) based on the state of its investigation at that time.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge made no error in his
    application of the <i>RBC</i> test in this
    case, and I would not interfere with his conclusion not to continue the
    Offshore Directions under s. 126(5). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore dismiss the appeal, in the
    circumstances, without costs.</p>

    of those jurisdictions to make the freeze orders without any further court
    order. Although the Alberta Commission has rejected the application of the <i>RBC</i> test based on the strength of the
    evidence that may be required, it is clear that a breach of the applicable
    securities legislation and some link to the frozen funds will be required: see <i>Workum (Re)</i> at paras. <span class=GramE>19-22; <i>Klytie</i> at para.</span> 21.</p>

    had found that although they could be misleading, the application failed with
    respect to them because other aspects of the RBC test were not met.</p>
