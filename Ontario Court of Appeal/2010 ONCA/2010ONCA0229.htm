  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted after a jury trial of
    attempted murder and aggravated assault, and sentenced to 10 years’
    imprisonment.  He appeals both conviction
    and sentence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts giving rise to these charges may be briefly
    stated.  The appellant engaged the complainant
    to do some web design work.  There were
    delays in completion and the appellant went to the complainant’s office where
    an argument about these delays ensued.  The complainant testified that he was suddenly attacked by the appellant
    and stabbed in the back repeatedly.  The
    appellant testified and acknowledged that he had stabbed the complainant, but asserted
    that he had been attacked first by the complainant and that he acted in
    self-defence.  The complainant was
    stabbed eight times and the broken blade of a knife was embedded in his
    spine.  The complainant suffered severe
    life-threatening injuries, leaving him permanently disabled.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal
    against conviction: </p>
  <p>1.         The trial judge erred by </p>
  <p><span class=GramE>a</span>.         permitting
    the Crown to lead evidence that the appellant exercised his right to silence;
    and </p>
  <p><span class=GramE>b</span>.         failing
    to instruct the jury as to the permissible use of prior consistent statements
    made by the complainant.</p>
  <p>2.         The trial
    judge erred by failing to give any legal instructions on the use of evidence of
    post-offence conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral submissions, the appellant abandoned the ground
    raised in his factum as to the adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions on
    self-defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further submits - and the respondent concedes
    – that the conviction for aggravated assault should be stayed under the principle
    developed in <i>Kienapple</i> <i>v. R.</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submits that the sentence
    imposed is unfit.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS </span></h4>
  <h3>1. Conviction appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appellant links the grounds relating to the
    right to silence and the use of the complainant’s prior consistent statements,
    I will deal with them jointly.</p>
  <h3><i>(i)
    Right to silence </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Crown vigorously cross-examined the
    appellant.  During the course of that
    cross-examination, the trial Crown questioned the appellant as to why he was
    rubbing his arm while testifying, suggesting that the appellant had a habit of
    rubbing his arm when nervous and that it was a sign that he was lying.  Defence counsel objected and the trial judge
    asked the trial Crown to move on.  However,
    the trial Crown persisted and proceeded to ask the appellant if he remembered
    speaking to the police at the station shortly after he had surrendered.  She referred to a video recording of the
    appellant’s interview with the police and suggested that he was rubbing his arm
    at that time.  The crucial portion of the
    cross-examination is embodied in the following question and answer:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. I’m going to suggest
    to you that that video is quite short, lasts about ten minutes, and all that
    happens is essentially that you’re seated, explained the allegations, you’re
    told about what [the complainant] said you did to him, and Detective Teeter
    explains to you the injury sustained by [the complainant]. Does that help you
    remember?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. The only thing that I remember is sitting in a
    room with Detective Teeter and a female officer asked if I want to make a
    specific statement, to which I declined, and I was taken back [to] where I was
    held.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, and as acknowledged by the respondent, the
    trial Crown’s cross-examination was problematic for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial Crown appears to have simply ignored
    the trial judge’s direction that she <span class=GramE>move</span> on to
    another topic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as the trial judge pointed out when attempting
    to dissuade the trial Crown from proceeding further, the fact that the
    appellant was rubbing his arm was demeanour evidence having little, if any,
    weight. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, by questioning the appellant on his police
    station interview in a case where she knew the appellant had exercised his
    right to silence, the trial Crown was entering into obviously dangerous
    territory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the appellant’s trial counsel did
    not object to the admission of evidence as to what occurred at the station, he
    did not move for a mistrial nor did he ask then or later for any corrective
    instruction to the jury regarding the right to silence.  Moreover, while the trial Crown certainly
    should have stayed away from the police station interview altogether, it was
    the appellant who volunteered the fact that he had declined to make a statement
    after his surrender.  He did so briefly
    and in a neutral manner that minimized the significance of the fact that he
    remained silent in the face of the police questioning.  Apart from a fleeting reference in the Crown’s
    closing address to the fact that neither she nor the jury had heard the
    appellant’s story before he testified, nothing was made of the fact that the
    appellant had exercised his right to silence when questioned by the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before considering the impact the right to silence
    issue had on the trial, I will examine the related ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i>(ii) Use of the complainant’s prior consistent
    statements</i><i></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the presentation of the case for the Crown,
    counsel briefly referred to a statement made by the complainant to the police
    in the hospital.  This reference appears
    to have been made as part of the narrative and, in any event, no objection was
    taken to this evidence.  It was during
    the cross-examination of the complainant that the appellant’s trial counsel
    extensively referenced various out-of-court statements made by the complainant.
     In the end, however, the appellant’s
    trial counsel failed to demonstrate any significant contradictions between
    those statements and the complainant’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s argument centres on the trial Crown’s
    closing address. In that address, she underscored that there were no
    inconsistencies between what the complainant had said at trial and what he had
    said earlier.  This, she submitted, signalled
    that the complainant was “telling the truth”.   She further stated: “The hallmark of a truthful witness is this: that
    there are no inconsistencies in their evidence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, there was no objection from defence counsel and
    no request for a limiting or corrective instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this amounted to an
    invitation by the Crown to draw the impermissible inference that, because the
    witness had told the same story in the past, he was more likely to be telling
    the truth when he testified in court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the respondent concedes that the trial Crown overstated
    the significance of the prior consistent statements, he nonetheless points out
    that virtually all of the prior consistent statements were led by the defence,
    not the Crown.  Moreover, the respondent further
    stresses that, as the defence had sought to use the prior statements to
    undermine the complainant’s credibility, the Crown was entitled to rebut that
    attack by emphasizing that the complainant had, in fact, been consistent in his
    statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the problem arising from the
    invasion of his right to silence is compounded by the Crown’s invitation to the
    jury to use the complainant’s prior consistent statements as a way of finding
    the complainant to be credible.  The
    appellant submits that in a case involving a flat-out contradiction between the
    two principal witnesses, the Crown was, in effect, telling the jury to disbelieve
    the appellant, who had refused to say anything until trial, and to believe the
    complainant had given a consistent version of the incident from the very start.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite Mr. Dineen’s very capable argument, in the end,
    I am simply not persuaded that whether considered individually or cumulatively,
    these regrettable features of the presentation of the Crown’s case occasioned
    any substantial prejudice to the appellant or gave rise to any miscarriage of
    justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Crown should not have ventured into the
    territory of the police station interview, it was the appellant who volunteered
    that he had exercised his right to silence.  His answer was brief and his counsel did not
    object or ask for any corrective instruction.  I agree with the respondent that a corrective
    instruction could well have served only to draw more attention to this feature
    of the evidence.  This was not a case
    where the appellant stood on his right to silence or where anything was made of
    the fact that, when he first encountered the police, he decided not to make any
    statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reach the same conclusion with respect to the prior
    consistent statement issue. It was the defence that led virtually all of the
    relevant evidence in an effort to undermine the complainant’s credibility.  While the Crown overstated the significance of
    the prior consistent statements at issue, it was nonetheless entitled to rebuff
    any suggestion that the complainant had been inconsistent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, when considered in the context of this trial
    as a whole, these were relatively minor errors and fleeting moments in a
    week-long trial that, in my view, would not have affected the outcome.  The appellant’s evidence as to what led to the
    stabbing was, in many respects, implausible and improbable while the nature of
    the injuries he inflicted upon the complainant was hardly consistent with his
    claim that he merely acted in self-defence.  I am entirely satisfied that the minor errors I
    have identified had no meaningful bearing on the outcome of this case and that,
    had they not occurred, the result would have been the same. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I am not persuaded that there was any
    reversible error and, even if there was, I would apply the curative proviso, s.
    686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii).</p>
  <h3>2. Post-offence conduct</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by
    failing to provide a limiting instruction with respect to evidence of post-offense
    conduct.  The evidence allegedly amounting
    to proof of post-offence conduct consisted in the appellant having left the
    scene of the crime and, given that no knife was found in that location, it
    could thus be inferred that the appellant had left with the knife to conceal it.
     The appellant relies on the
    well-established principle that a limiting instruction is required when the Crown
    adduces evidence of post-offence conduct to support an inference of
    consciousness of guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am unable to accept the appellant’s submission on
    this issue. One of the central issues at trial was the source of the weapon
    used to stab the complainant.  The
    complainant thought that it was concealed and attached to a cane being carried
    by the appellant.  The appellant denied that
    he came armed with a knife and testified that during the struggle, he reached
    up and grabbed a knife from a table.  Clearly,
    the origin of the knife was a crucial issue.  If the appellant came armed with a knife, his
    self-defence argument would be seriously undermined.  Similarly, any callousness he demonstrated
    towards the complainant by leaving the scene had a direct bearing on whether he
    had the requisite intent for attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondent’s characterization of the
    trial Crown’s submissions on this point.  The trial Crown did not invite the jury to
    infer guilt or consciousness of guilt from the appellant’s actions following
    the stabbing.  Rather, the trial Crown
    invited the jury to conclude that: (1) the appellant had left with the same
    knife he brought to the meeting and used to attack the complainant; and (2) his
    actions at the time of the offence indicated that he had the intent to kill the
    complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note, as well, that the appellant’s trial counsel did
    not ask for an instruction on evidence of post-offence conduct or raise any
    objection to the charge on this ground. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h3>3. Sentence appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence of 10
    years’ imprisonment.  The trial judge
    gave detailed and careful reasons for sentence.  He reviewed the circumstances surrounding the
    offence in depth.  He identified all
    mitigating factors, the principal one being that the appellant was a first
    offender with strong antecedents, and this offence appears to have been
    completely out of character. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the submission that the sentence
    imposed by the trial judge failed to take into account his own finding that the
    attack on the complainant had not been proved to be premeditated or planned.  The trial judge specifically adverted to that
    fact when considering where to locate this offence and this offender within the
    range of 5 to 15 years that he identified for this case.  He recognized that, taken in isolation, the appellant’s
    antecedents and lack of pre-meditation would push the case into the lower part
    of that range.  He concluded, however,
    that a sentence in the middle of the range was warranted because of the severe
    nature of the injuries inflicted upon the complainant and the devastating and

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would stay the conviction for aggravated
    assault under the <i>Kineapple</i> principle.
     However, I would otherwise dismiss the
    appeal from conviction.  I would grant leave
    to appeal sentence but dismiss the appeal.</p>
