    Claims Court Rules,</i> O. Reg. 258/98 allows a party to bring a motion to
    strike out or amend a document.  Pursuant
    to this rule, the appellant, Dr. Irwin Butkowsky, brought a motion for summary
    judgment in an action brought against him by the respondent, Robertus Van de
    Vrande.  The trial judge granted the
    motion, finding that the appellant was immune from suit and that the action was
    brought beyond the applicable limitation period.  The Divisional Court set aside the order,
    finding that the trial judge had erred by making findings of fact on the
    motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the order of the Divisional
    Court.  In so doing, he raises the
    question of the availability of a motion for summary judgment under the <i>Small Claims Court Rules</i>.  For the reasons that follow, I have concluded
    that the procedure of a motion for summary judgment is not available under the
    Small Claims Court Rules but that the motion judge’s decision is nonetheless
    sustainable under r. 12.02.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was retained pursuant to s. 30 of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.12 to perform an assessment in the context of a custody dispute between
    the respondent and his spouse.  The
    appellant’s report was released on July 14, 2004.  The respondent alleges that on May 5, 2004
    the appellant shared an interim oral report together with a written parenting
    plan with the respondent and his spouse. He alleges that the contents of this
    interim oral and written report were substantially different from the final
    report released on July 14, 2004.  The respondent
    alleges that, instead of simply conducting and submitting an assessment as per
    his retainer, the appellant took on the additional role of mediator in the
    dispute.  The respondent alleges that the
    appellant advised him that court proceedings were ineffective and that he
    settled 95% of the cases referred to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 11, 2007, the respondent commenced an action
    in Small Claims Court, alleging that by acting as a mediator, the appellant had
    breached his contract as an assessor and acted negligently.  The appellant brought a motion seeking
    summary judgment on May 14, 2008.  The motion
    judge granted the motion pursuant to <span class=GramE>rr</span>. 1.03(2) and 12.02
    of the <i>Small Claims Court Rules</i>.  In so doing, she found that the appellant, in
    his capacity as a court appointed assessor, was immune from suit pursuant to
    the doctrine of expert witness immunity.  In the alternative, she found that the action had been commenced outside
    of the applicable limitation period.  She
    found that the applicable limitation period was two years, pursuant to the <i>Limitations Act, 2002,</i> S.O. 2002, c. 24,
    Sch.B<i> </i>as the cause of action arose
    when a motion to compel the appellant to discuss his report with a second
    expert was denied on February 9, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court set aside the motion judge’s order.  Applying the jurisprudence emanating from
    Rule 20 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, <span lang=EN-US>R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, it </span>found
    that, on a motion for summary judgment, the motion judge was not entitled to
    make findings of fact.  She therefore
    erred in granting summary judgment pursuant to the doctrine of expert witness
    immunity, as doing so required rejecting the respondent’s argument that the
    appellant had gone beyond his role as assessor and was therefore not entitled
    to such immunity.  Similarly, in granting
    summary judgment because the action was commenced after the applicable
    limitation period, the motion judge erred in finding that the cause of action
    had not become discoverable prior to the coming into force of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> on January 1,
    2002.</p>

    respect to the availability of a motion for summary judgment, the appellant
    argues that such a motion can be read into the <i>Small Claims Court Rules</i>.  He
    argues that the absence of explicit reference to such a motion in the <i>Small Claim Court Rules</i> is a gap.  In attempting to fill this gap, he refers to
    r. 1.03(2), which reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If
    these rules do not cover a matter adequately, the court may give directions and
    make any order that is just, and the practice shall be decided by analogy to
    these rules, by reference to the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i> and the Act governing the action and, if the court considers
    it appropriate, by reference to the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure. </i> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    arguing for the availability of a motion for summary judgment, the appellant
    emphasizes s. 25 of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, which provides that Small Claims Court should
    proceed in a summary manner.  He therefore
    argues that, pursuant to r. 1.03(2) of the <i>Small
    Claims Court Rules </i>and s. 25 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act,</i> r. 12.02 should be read broadly, as allowing a motion for
    summary judgment.  With respect to the
    applicable test, he argues that reference should be had to r. 76.07 (since repealed
    on January 1, 2010) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>,<i> </i>which governs motions for
    summary judgment under the simplified procedure, and allows a motion judge to
    make findings of fact.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent argues that such motions are not available under the <i>Small Claims Court Rules</i>.  He submits that the silence of the <i>Small Claims Court Rules </i>is a deliberate
    omission, not a gap to be filled.  In the
    respondent’s view, a motion for summary judgment is as foreign to the
    proceedings of the Small Claims Court as examinations for discovery and not to
    be read into the <i>Small Claims Court Rules</i>.  In the respondent’s view, both the motion
    judge and Divisional Court erred in applying tests for motions for summary
    judgment to <span class=GramE>a</span> r. 12.02 motion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, the Divisional Court erred in applying the jurisprudence and
    principles emanating from r. 20 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  This rule deals
    with a summary judgment motion in an action that is brought in Superior Court pursuant
    to the rules that apply to that court.  I
    do not view the failure to provide for summary judgment motions as a gap in the <i>Small Claims Court Rules</i>, but rather
    a deliberate omission.  It is not up to
    the court to read in such a provision, particularly in light of the fact that
    r. 12.02 specifically addresses the ability to bring a motion in the nature of
    those contemplated by <span class=GramE>rr</span>. 20, 21 and 76 <i>Rules of civil Procedure.</i>  If a motion for summary judgment of the kind
    provided for in r. 20 is to be created, it is a matter for the Rules Committee
    and not the courts.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    I view r. 12.02 as being situated somewhere between the rules 20 and 21 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  It is not a summary judgment motion involving
    extensive affidavits and a requirement such as contemplated in r. 20 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>where the
    responding party must put his “best foot forward”.  It is more akin to <span class=GramE>a</span> r. 21 motion, although it is worded more broadly and does not have the same
    prohibition on the filing of affidavit evidence.  It is a motion that is brought in the spirit
    of the summary nature of Small Claims Court proceedings and involves an
    analysis of whether a reasonable cause of action has been disclosed or whether
    the proceeding should be ended at an early stage because its continuation would
    be “inflammatory”, a “waste of time” or a “nuisance.”  </span></p>

    my view, the references to actions that are inflammatory, a waste of time, or a
    nuisance was intended to lower the very high threshold set by r. 21.01(3<span
class=GramE>)(</span>d)’s reference to actions that are frivolous, vexatious,
    or an abuse of process. </span></p>

    bears remembering that r. 12.02 motions will often be brought and responded to
    by self-represented litigants who lack the extensive training of counsel. The
    test to be applied on such a motion ought to reflect this, and avoid the
    somewhat complex case law that has fleshed out the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>2)  Did the motion judge err in
    holding that the appellant was immune from suit and that the action was filed
    outside the applicable limitation period?</span></h4>

    the matter before us, the motion judge correctly referred to and applied r.
    12.02 in deciding the issue before her.  Unfortunately, at one point she erroneously referred to the motion as
    one for summary judgment.  This is likely
    due to the appellant having mislabeled his motion in this way. I do not,
    however, consider this error as undermining her analysis and conclusion.  </span></p>

    respondent’s argument with respect to immunity turns on his assertion that at
    some point the appellant ceased to act as a psychiatrist, and instead took on
    the role of mediator.  The respondent
    bases this argument primarily on the appellant’s issuing of the “interim”
    report and his statement to the respondent that he “settles” the vast majority
    of cases referred to him.  The motion judge
    rejected this argument.  She reviewed the
    material before her, including the affidavit material and it was clear from her
    reasons that she felt able to determine the relevant issues based on the evidence
    presented to her. Applying r. 12.02(1), the motion judge was satisfied that the
    claims asserted by the respondent all arose in the course of the appellant’s
    work as a court-appointed assessor.  She
    found, therefore, that the immunity issue was such that the claim had virtually
    no chance of success and ought to be struck.</span></p>

    motion judge went on to find that, even if she had erred in her conclusion on
    the immunity issue, the claim had no chance of success because it was
    instituted after the applicable limitation period had expired.  In reaching this conclusion she addressed and
    rejected the respondent’s submission that the transitional rules of the <i>Limitations Act</i> 2002 applied to the
    respondent’s claim.</span></p>
