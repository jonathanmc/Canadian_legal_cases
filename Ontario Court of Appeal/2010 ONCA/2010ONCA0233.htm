  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following an application for rectification brought by
    TCR Holding Corporation (“TCR”), in which Henry Heidt and Angela Young
    intervened as added parties, Newbould J. set aside the amalgamation of TCR and
    several subsidiary companies <i>nunc pro tunc</i>.  The interveners appeal the decision, dated
    August 19, 2009, and request that the order be set aside and judgment
    dismissing the application for amalgamation be entered.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. </span><u><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The
    parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>a. June 2000 share purchase transaction </span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2000, the president of TCR, Trent Robinson,
    agreed to purchase Henry Heidt’s shares in Heidt Products Inc. (“HPI”), a
    manufacturer of school and institutional furniture in Waterloo.  Heidt owned all the shares in HPI, and he
    agreed to a sale price of $11.5 million, payable $9 million at closing with a
    promissory note for the balance, payable in five years.  The promissory note was secured by a
    guarantee from HPI and from “Holdco”, the corporate sole owner of the purchaser
    of HPI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1420859 Ontario Limited (“859”) was subsequently
    incorporated to be the purchaser of HPI.  Also incorporated was 1420846 Ontario Limited (“846”) as “Holdco”, the
    corporate sole owner of the purchaser, 859.  In a share purchase agreement dated June 30, 2000, 859 as the purchaser
    of HPI gave a promissory note to Heidt for the $2.5 million balance.  846, as the owner of 859, provided the guarantee
    on the promissory note to Heidt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, as of June 30, 2000, TCR owned all the
    shares of 846; 846 owned all the shares of 859; and 859 acquired all the shares
    of HPI.  On closing, 859 amalgamated with
    HPI to form HPI, making 846 the holder of the shares of HPI, and HPI gave Heidt
    a new promissory note for $2.5 million to replace that from 859, which 846
    guaranteed by pledging the shares of HPI to Heidt.  The only assets of 846 were the shares of
    HPI.</p>
  <h3>b. October 31, 2003 amended promissory
    note </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A new promissory note was issued by HPI to Heidt on
    October 31, 2003, for $2 million.  This
    was the outstanding balance on the debt.  Under the new promissory note, the date for payment was extended to July
    6, 2010; however, HPI defaulted in payment of the new note on October 31,
    2006.  The outstanding balance at that
    time was $1.6 million.  On November 1,
    2006, a receiver was appointed for HPI.  Unable to sell the assets, the receiver placed HPI into bankruptcy on
    December 21, 2006.  HPI had assets of
    $2.4 million and liabilities of $12.6 million.</p>
  <h3>c. 2008 amalgamation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 22, 2008, TCR amalgamated with several wholly
    owned subsidiary companies: 991 Victoria North Limited, Ferris Drive Limited,
    and 846.  As a result of the
    amalgamation, TCR assumed the liabilities of 846, the guarantor of the HPI
    promissory note to Heidt.  The
    amalgamation was recommended by Douglas Bruns, TCR’s accountant, and Paul
    Flemming, its solicitor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bruns recommended the amalgamation for tax planning
    purposes, but stated that the inclusion of 846 played no role in the tax
    planning: he meant the amalgamation to dissolve 846 as he considered it a
    purposeless “shell company”.  Bruns also
    stated that had he known about the potential liability on the guarantee, he
    would never have recommended 846’s amalgamation with TCR.  Flemming, though he was involved in the June 2000
    transaction, stated that he had forgotten about 846’s outstanding obligation to
    Heidt as a result of its guarantee on the promissory note.  Robinson stated that he was unaware that 846
    had guaranteed the promissory note to Heidt, and certified 846 as solvent prior
    to the amalgamation, unaware of its assets and liabilities.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    litigation</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Heidt commenced litigation against TCR and the law firm
    that had acted contemporaneously for Heidt, Robinson and their respective
    corporations.  By Statement of Claim
    issued on October 10, 2008, Heidt claimed against TCR based on the guarantee of
    846 that had become a potential liability of TCR through the amalgamation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TCR delivered a Statement of Defence and Crossclaim,
    pleading: (a) that the sole purpose of including 846 in the amalgamation was to
    clean up and streamline the corporate holdings of TCR; (b) that Flemming and
    Bruns had mistakenly and negligently failed to take into consideration any
    ongoing obligations of 846 pursuant to the guarantee in the amalgamation; and
    (c) the defences of mistake and <i>non est factum</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TCR then made an application for an order setting aside
    the amalgamation of TCR and its subsidiary companies, including 846,
    principally on the basis that 846 had been included in the amalgamation in
    error.  The respondent Ontario, on behalf
    of the Director appointed under the <i>Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. B.16, did not oppose the order sought and takes no position in this
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that the intention of
    TCR, as formed by Robinson on the advice of Bruns and Flemming, was that 846
    was to be included in the amalgamation as a corporation without any
    liabilities.  He defined the mistake to
    be rectified as Robinson’s lack of knowledge as to the liabilities of 846,
    Flemming’s lack of recollection, and Bruns’ assumption that 846 had no
    liabilities, preparing yearly financial statements for 846 on that basis.  He found further that no one would be
    prejudiced by an order setting aside the amalgamation, neither TCR nor the interveners.  With regard to the interveners, he stated
    that they would not be prejudiced as it could not be said that they were losing
    something to which they were entitled; in fact, he considered it a windfall to
    the interveners if the amalgamation was not set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge set aside the amalgamation,
    noting that TCR and the other companies involved would be free to undertake a
    new amalgamation.  He also noted in
    passing that he saw no reason that the court could not also grant to TCR relief
    against mistake, an alternative equitable ground paired with rectification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interveners appeal the application judge’s
    decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUE</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue on the appeal is whether the application
    judge erred in setting aside the amalgamation of TCR and its subsidiary
    companies.  The appellants also challenge
    the application judge’s costs award.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the application judge made
    several factual and legal errors in his analysis culminating in the setting
    aside of the amalgamation of TCR and its subsidiary companies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellants assert that the application judge
    erred by concluding that the intention of the parties seeking the amalgamation
    was to include 846 in the amalgamation as a company with no liabilities.  Rather the intent, claim the appellants, was
    a simpler one – to amalgamate the four companies, irrespective of their current
    financial situations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission.  The application judge’s conclusion on this
    point is a factual one and is, therefore, subject to substantial
    deference.  The application judge
    reviewed the relevant evidence, including the evidence of Robinson, Flemming
    and Bruns, and concluded that “the intention of TCR … was that 846 was to be
    included in the amalgamation as a corporation without any liabilities.”  I see no basis for interfering with this
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellants contend that the creation by the
    amalgamation of a debt owing to them is not, as the application judge found, a
    windfall.  846 owed money to the
    appellants and TCR stepped into its shoes, thereby becoming liable to pay off
    the debt.  It follows, say the
    appellants, that the application judge also erred by concluding that the
    appellants would suffer no prejudice if the amalgamation was set aside; on the
    contrary, the appellants’ prejudice would be an inability, bordering on
    impossibility, of recovering the debt owed to them by 846.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a sense, this is the flip side of the appellants’
    first submission.  Importantly, like the
    first submission, it implicates the application judge’s assessment of the
    factual record.  The application judge
    carefully reviewed the history of the transactions, including the genesis of,
    and rationale for, 846’s guarantee.  He
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The covenant of TCR was never bargained for and
    would be a windfall if the amalgamation were not set aside.  I share the view of Farley J. in <i>Re: GT Group Telecom Inc.</i> (2004), 5 CBR
    (5<sup>th</sup>) 230 that it would be inappropriate for a party, in that case
    the CCRA, to claim a windfall benefit which arose through an inadvertent
    mistake.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>In my view, this conclusion cannot
    be considered a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellants submit that the application judge
    erred in his understanding and application of the principle of rectification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Snell’s Equity</i>, 31st ed. (John McGhee ed.,
    London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2005), the equitable principle of rectification is
    defined at para. 14-02:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There will be cases where the terms of the
    instrument do not accord with the true agreement between the parties: a term
    may have been omitted, or an unwanted term included, or a term may be expressed
    in the wrong way.  In such cases, equity
    has power to reform, or rectify, that instrument so as to make it accord with
    the true agreement.  What is rectified is
    not a mistake in the transaction itself, but a mistake in the way in which that
    transaction has been expressed in writing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants assert that although the application
    judge purported to conduct a rectification analysis, his actual conclusion –
    setting aside the amalgamation – does not comport with the above definition of
    the remedy.  In light of the application
    judge’s factual conclusion that “the true intention of TCR … was that 846 was
    to be included in the amalgamation as a corporation without any liabilities”, they
    argue that, if the law permitted, the proper rectification order would have
    been to amend the amalgamation to reflect this intention.  This is not what the application judge did;
    instead, he simply set aside the amalgamation, effectively sending all of the
    parties back to ‘square one’.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is some force to this submission.  A pure rectification order amending the
    amalgamation to reflect the parties’ intention that 846 was joining the
    amalgamated company with no liabilities would have violated s. 178(2)(a)(i) of
    the <i>Business Corporations Act</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>178(2)The articles of amalgamation shall have
    attached          thereto a statement of a
    director or an officer of each       amalgamating
    corporation stating that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (a)
    there are reasonable grounds for believing that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) each amalgamating
    corporation is and the amalgamated corporation will be able to pay its
    liabilities as they become due,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the application judge did not make a
    rectification order along these lines.  Rather, although he used the analysis and language of rectification, in
    the end he simply set aside <i>nunc pro tunc </i>the amalgamation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question then becomes: was this order lawful and
    appropriate?  In my view, it was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Broadly speaking, a superior court has “all the powers
    that are necessary to do justice between the parties”: see <i>80 Wellesley St.
    East Ltd. v. Fundy Bay Builders Ltd.</i>, [1972] 2 O.R. 280 (C.A.), at p. 282.  More specifically, “superior courts have
    equitable jurisdiction to relieve persons from the effect of their mistakes”:
    see <i>771225 Ontario Inc. v. Bramco Holdings Co.</i> (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 739
    (C.A.), at p. 741.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was the alternative basis for the application
    judge’s order.  After reviewing the
    relevant evidence, he characterized the inclusion of a still debt-liable 846 in
    the amalgamation as “an inadvertent mistake” and, citing <i>Bramco</i> and this
    court’s decision in <i>Attorney General of Canada v. Juliar</i> (2000), 50 O.R.
    (30) 728, concluded that there was “no reason not to grant the relief to TCR
    under this equitable jurisdiction to relieve against mistake.”  I see no basis for disagreeing with this
    analysis or with the application judge’s exercise of discretion in setting
    aside the amalgamation.  The amalgamating
    companies agreed to the amalgamation based on the mistake that 846 was debt
    free.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants submit that the application
    judge should not have awarded costs to TCR because it was TCR’s fault that the
    application became necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The
    respondent in the application, her Majesty the Queen in right of Ontario, did
    not contest the application.  The
    appellants, as interveners on the application, did.  Their intervention generated costs to TCR in
    preparation and in response to their position.  The application judge, in the exercise of his discretion, made a costs
    order in favour of TCR.  I would not
    interfere with this order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of
    the appeal which I would fix at $32,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
