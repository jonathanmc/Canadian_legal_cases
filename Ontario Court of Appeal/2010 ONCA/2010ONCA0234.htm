  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal from the order of Price J. dated
    July 29, 2009, granting partial summary judgment to the respondents for the
    return of a $250,000 deposit on a failed commercial lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the motion judge erred in
    two important respects.  First, the
    appellants submit that partial summary judgment should not have been granted
    because the crucial lease provision in issue – the termination clause – had
    more than one meaning.  The
    interpretation of the clause would require the assessment of conflicting
    extrinsic evidence, necessitating a trial. Second, the appellants argue that
    partial summary judgment should not have been granted because the portion of
    the claim on which partial summary judgment was sought was inextricably linked
    to, and not severable from, all of the liability issues in the main action and
    the counterclaim.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The
    parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wild Water Kingdom Ltd. (“Wild Water”) operates a
    recreational facility in the summer months consisting primarily of a water
    park.  In early 2007, Wild Water decided
    to expand its operations into the winter by constructing a sports dome facility
    that would cover three sports fields and be used primarily for soccer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WWK Sportsdome Inc. (“WWK”) developed and was the lessor
    of the sports dome facility.  Edward
    Chong (“Chong”) is the principal of both Wild Water and WWK.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.G. Sports Inc. (“D.G. Sports”) is an owner and
    organizer of recreational indoor soccer leagues for children and adults.  In order to operate these leagues, D.G.
    Sports rents indoor soccer fields from third parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David Gee (“Gee”) is the principal of D.G. Sports.  On or about March 12, 2007, Gee delivered to
    Chong a letter of intent concerning a proposed lease for the sports dome
    facility that WWK planned to construct.  The letter of intent was accepted by Chong, on behalf of WWK, on May 23,
    2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After acceptance of the letter of intent, there were
    considerable negotiations.  The parties
    executed the lease and an addendum on September 11, 2007.  WWK was the lessor and D.G. Sports and Gee
    were the lessees.  Wild Water and Chong
    were guarantors with respect to a WWK obligation, under the addendum to the
    lease, to repay certain funds to D.G. Sports and Gee in the event that they
    were entitled to terminate the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lease agreement had a 4.5 year term from October 1,
    2007 to April 30, 2012.  The guaranteed
    rental dates for each year were October 1 to April 30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lease payments totalled over $3.5 million for the term
    of the lease.  Prior to October 1, 2007,
    the lessees made four deposit payments totalling $250,000.  On October 1, 2007, a rent payment of
    $149,780 was due.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lease contained termination provisions in favour of
    both the lessor and the lessees.  The
    lessees’ provision was s.3(a)(ii), which provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Termination.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) This Agreement may be terminated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) at the option of Lessee, (A) with immediate
    effect in the event that completion of the Air-Supported Structure is delayed
    beyond September 30, 2007, and (B) in the event that Lessor shall fail to
    perform any other material obligation of Lessor under this Agreement, and such
    non-performance shall continue uncured ten (10) days after written notice
    thereof to Lessor;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of October 1, 2007, the sports dome facility could
    not be used for soccer matches.  There
    was no heat or water in the facility.  It
    also lacked the fire access route and fire hydrants necessary for the facility
    to be lawful under the <i>Building Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 1, 2007, Gee received a telephone call from
    Chong’s representative, Mark Anthony, demanding that the lessees make the rent
    payment of $149,780 due that day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day, October 2, 2007, Chong sent a letter to
    Gee, warning the lessees that if they did not pay the rent instalment of
    $149,780 by October 8, 2007, “the landlord reserves its right to terminate the
    Lease without prejudice to all other remedies available to it, including its
    right to require the immediate payment of all rent for the remainder of the
    Term.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later that day, Gee sent a Notice of Termination to
    Chong purporting to terminate the lease pursuant to s. 3(a)(ii)(A) of the lease
    on the basis that the “completion of the Air-Supported Structure has been
    delayed beyond September 30, 2007.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The various defects in, and relating to, the sports
    dome facility were corrected soon thereafter, and the City of Brampton issued
    an occupancy permit for the facility on October 17, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 5, 2007, the respondents commenced an
    action.  They sought a declaration that
    WWK had breached the lease, and claimed damages for the $250,000 already paid
    to WWK and for lost profits.  The
    respondents alleged that the appellants breached the lease because the
    “Air-Supported Structure” referred to in s. 3(a)(ii)(A) was not completed by
    September 30, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 5, 2007, the appellants defended the
    respondents’ claim and WWK brought a counterclaim.  The counterclaim claimed damages from the
    respondents for breach of the lease.  The
    appellants alleged that the respondents were not entitled to terminate the
    lease because the “Air-Supported Structure” was completed as of September 30, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents brought a motion for summary judgment,
    seeking only damages of $250,000, this being “the repayment of all deposit and
    pre-paid rental instalments paid to [September 30, 2007] pursuant to section
    4(b) of the Lease Agreement”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge granted the motion, with supporting
    reasons delivered on July 29, 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal the motion judge’s Order.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two issues on the appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    motion judge err in granting summary judgment based on an incorrect application
    of core principles of contract law?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did the
    motion judge err in granting summary judgment in circumstances where the issue
    before him was not severable from the remaining liability issues in the main
    action and counterclaim?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) <u>Contract interpretation</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the motion judge erred by
    basing summary judgment on a contractual interpretation that could only be made
    by resorting to conflicting extrinsic evidence.  In such a context, assert the appellants, summary judgment is
    inappropriate: see <i>Hi-tech Group Inc. v.
    Sears Canada Inc.</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), at para. 26.  In this case, the pivotal words
    “Air-Supported Structure” in s. 3(a)(ii)(A) of the lease were not defined in
    the lease.  Since the parties disagreed
    on the proper definition, it follows that a trial was necessary to resolve the
    disagreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission.  The motion judge reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I must determine if the lease in the present case
    is clear and unambiguous.  In making this
    determination, I have reminded myself that “effect must, if possible, be given
    to every word and every clause in an agreement”.  If a provision in the lease is reasonably
    susceptible of more than one meaning, I would be compelled to find that it is
    ambiguous.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is my opinion that the meaning of “Air-Supported
    Structure” must be derived from its context of the D.G. Sports’ lease of a
    facility for the known purpose of renting it to third parties for the soccer
    season beginning October 1<sup>st</sup>.  I find that D.G. Sports was unable to use the facility for that purpose
    at the beginning of the soccer season on October 1, 2007 because it lacked heat
    and water or any lawful access to or from it for fire safety.  It would make no sense for me to find, in those
    circumstances, that D.G. Sports had no right to terminate because the membrane
    enclosing the fields was inflated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If there is an ambiguity in a contract, evidence of
    the circumstances surrounding the making of it is admissible.  If evidence of the surrounding circumstances
    in the present case were necessary in order to interpret the lease, I would be
    compelled to conclude that “the process cannot be fully carried out until
    findings of fact have been made on evidence”.  Once there is a necessity to make findings on evidence that are open to
    different interpretations, inferences and different views on what weight should
    be given to them, I would have to conclude that there is a genuine issue for
    trial and not grant summary judgment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the present case, if Mr. Gee’s evidence had been
    that the parties used the terms “Air-Supported Structure” and “sports dome”
    interchangeably but Mr. Chong’s evidence had been that the parties ascribed
    very different meanings to the terms and this difference of evidence were material
    to the interpretation of the lease and to whether the “Air-Supported Structure”
    was completed by the required date, then I would dismiss the motion and leave
    these issues to be decided by a trial judge.  That is not the case here.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is my opinion that the interpretation of the
    terms “Air-Supported Structure” can be determined from the wording of the lease
    itself.  That interpretation is
    overwhelmingly supported by the circumstances attested to by the witnesses,
    including the parties themselves and the City’s representative, who was
    responsible for deciding whether the facility was fit to be used for intended
    purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this reasoning is sound.  First, it focusses on the words of the
    lease.  Second, it properly links the
    words of the lease with the known purpose of the lease – to establish a
    facility for indoor soccer usable at the start of the soccer season: October 1,
    2007.  Third, there was no conflicting
    extrinsic evidence about either the purpose of the lease or the
    interchangeability of the terms “Air-Supported Structure” and “sports
    dome”.  The consistent evidence of the
    representatives of the appellants, respondents and City of Brampton was that
    these were interchangeable terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ second submission under the rubric of
    contract interpretation is that, even if the motion judge was entitled to
    interpret the term “Air-Supported Structure” on a motion for summary judgment,
    he erred in his interpretation of the term.  Specifically, the appellants contend that the trial judge’s interpretation
    of this term was inconsistent with the negotiations leading up to the lease,
    ignores the alternative remedy in s. 3(a)(ii)(B) of the lease, wrongly treats
    the non-completion of the “Air-Supported Structure” as a fundamental breach of
    the contract, and is inconsistent with good business sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with this submission.  In my view, the motion judge correctly
    focussed on the wording of the crucial provision in the lease and on the
    central contextual factor related to it, namely, the creation of a facility
    capable of being used by indoor soccer leagues as of October 1, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I want to say a word specifically about the appellants’
    ‘good business sense’ argument, which is that s. 3(a)(ii)(A) of the lease must
    be interpreted in the context of a lease with a duration of 4.5 years and
    involving payment obligations of over $3.5 million.  In that context, say the appellants, a
    two-week delay in having the facility ready for use should not permit termination
    of the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  In
    my view, it is instructive to note what actually happened on October 1 and 2,
    2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gee’s description of the events of October is contained
    in his affidavit dated December 22, 2008:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On or about October 1, 2007, I received a phone
    call from Mr. Anthony, on behalf of WWK, who demanded that I pay the 5<sup>th</sup> Installment of the rent payment for Year 1 of the lease term as per section
    4(b) of the Lease Agreement.  I was
    concerned because the Sports Dome was not completed and I had no indication
    from Mr. Anthony, WWK or anyone else as to when it would in fact be
    completed.  Further, when I asked Mr.
    Anthony whether I could speak to Dr. Chong, he said that Dr. Chong was not
    available to speak with me.  Mr. Anthony
    said that Dr. Chong was too busy.  Later
    on in the afternoon of October 1<sup>st</sup>, I actually attended at Dr.
    Chong’s office in order to attempt to see him.  I waited approximately twenty minutes and then left the office without
    seeing him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chong’s description of the same events is found in his
    affidavit dated January 16, 2009:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am advised by Mr. Anthony and do verily believe
    that on October 1, 2007, Mr. Gee and Mr. Anthony had a telephone conversation
    during which Mr. Gee advised Mr. Anthony that the Plaintiffs would be
    withholding the payment of the 5<sup>th</sup> rent installment in the amount of
    $149,780.00 which was due on October 1, 2007, pursuant to the Lease.  Mr. Gee advised Mr. Anthony that he had the
    money but that he would not release it unless he could meet with me personally
    to discuss his concerns and to further negotiate the terms of the Lease.  I advised Mr. Anthony that Mr. Gee was not
    entitled to impose any preconditions to withhold rent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day, October 2, 2007, Chong sent the letter
    demanding payment of the $149,780 rent instalment and threatening termination
    of the lease if payment was not made.  Later the same day, Gee purported to terminate the lease pursuant to s.
    3(a)(ii)(A).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellants that the duration and value
    of the lease are important contextual facts.  However, under the rubric of ‘good business sense’, they support the
    respondents’ decision to terminate.  The
    reality is that on October 1, 2007: (1) the facility was not useable; (2) this
    was the first day of the first year of a 4.5 year plan to rent the facility to
    indoor soccer leagues; (3) the landlord was telling the lessees absolutely
    nothing about when the facility would be useable (Chong’s affidavit does not
    contest this point); (4) the landlord was demanding immediate payment of a huge
    rent instalment ($149,780) for a facility where not one soccer match could take
    place; and (5) the landlord was threatening legal action, including
    termination, if payment was not forthcoming.  In my view, against the backdrop of this constellation of contextual facts,
    it was Gee who displayed ‘good business sense’ by invoking the termination
    clause available to him in the lease.  Or, as expressed vividly by the motion judge: “It would make no sense
    for me to find, in those circumstances, that D.G. Sports had no right to
    terminate because the membrane enclosing the fields was inflated.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>Partial summary judgment and severability</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the motion judge erred in
    granting partial summary judgment in circumstances where the issue before him
    was not severable from the remaining liability issues in the main action and
    counterclaim, both of which must go to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue determined by the motion judge was that the
    “Air-Supported Structure” was not completed by September 30, 2007, as required
    by the lease and, therefore, the respondents were entitled to terminate the
    lease pursuant to s. 3(a)(ii)(A).  The
    appellants submit that this is the crucial, albeit not the only, issue in both
    the respondents’ action and the appellants’ counterclaim and that its resolution
    on a motion for summary judgment improperly precludes consideration of the
    issue at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the appellants say that the balance of
    the respondents’ claim for lost profits under the lease will require the trial
    court to determine whether WWK breached the lease.  Similarly, the liability determination on
    WWK’s counterclaim against the respondents will require a determination of
    whether it was the respondents who breached the lease.  Given that this will require the trial court
    to determine whether the “Air-Supported Structure” was completed by September
    30, 2007, the appellants argue that the motion judge improperly severed these
    issues by resolving them on the motion for summary judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission.  Rule 20 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, specifically
    authorizes partial summary judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>20.01(1) A plaintiff may … move with supporting
    affidavit material or other evidence for summary judgment on all or <i>part of the claim</i> in the statement of
    claim.                                                                                                             [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ford Motor Co.
    of Canada Ltd. v. Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board</i> (1997), 36
    O.R. (3d) 384 (C.A.), Osborne J.A. identified three categories of cases in
    which a motion for partial summary judgment is appropriate.  He described the first category in this
    fashion at pp. 394-95:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The cases in which summary judgment has been
    granted for “part of” a claim seem to me to fall into three groups:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) actions where the evidence establishes that
    there is no genuine issue for trial in respect of a discrete claim.  These partial summary judgment cases require
    no further comment except to say the result of summary judgment for “part of” a
    claim is consistent with the purpose of Rule 20; the partial summary judgment
    removes a discrete issue from the issues to be tried and thus shortens the
    trial.  This is consistent with
    “procedural justice” concerns referred to by Morden A.C.J.O. in <i>Irving Ungerman</i> and with the purpose of
    Rule 20 as referred to in <i>Jockey Club</i>;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this is precisely the purpose and effect of
    the successful motion for summary judgment in this case.  The respondents brought a motion for summary
    judgment on a discrete issue – partial damages (i.e. the return of deposit
    monies) that were clearly identifiable under the terms of the lease in an
    action with a sole liability issue that was clearly engaged by the respondents’
    motion.  The respondents led evidence in
    support of the motion and the appellants responded.  The motion judge determined that the
    appellants’ response did not raise a genuine issue for trial with respect to
    the sole liability issue.  In my view,
    the motion judge’s determination of this issue was correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true, as the respondents assert, that the effect
    of granting partial judgment is that no liability issue is left for trial.  The respondents’ action would proceed on the
    issue of damages, and the appellants’ counterclaim would be moot.  However, these are the natural and
    permissible consequences of a motion for summary judgment properly brought and
    granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants assert that the motion judge’s
    award of costs of $63,000 to the respondents for the summary judgment motion
    was unreasonable.  On the record before
    us, there is no basis for interfering with the costs award.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  The respondents are entitled to their costs
    of the appeal which I would fix at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
