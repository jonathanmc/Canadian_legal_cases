  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background Facts and Procedural History on
    the Underlying Murder Charge</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Robert Badgerow, the applicant, is charged
    with the first degree murder of Diane Werendowicz.  On June 20, 1981, the morning after friends
    had last seen her, Ms.&nbsp;Werendowicz was found lying face down in a creek
    with a tire over her head and her purse strap wrapped around her neck.  Police found what forensic testing revealed
    was semen on her jeans and in her vagina.  With the murder still unsolved in 1998, the Centre for Forensic Sciences
    was able to employ scientific advances to extract a DNA profile from the
    semen.  It matched a DNA sample from Mr.
    Badgerow.  Police arrested Mr.&nbsp;Badgerow
    on December 1, 1998.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      At trial before Lofchik J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice sitting with a jury, the Crown alleged that Mr. Badgerow
    sexually assaulted and strangled Ms Werendowicz to death.  As part of the evidence on which its
    prosecution relied, the Crown submitted a statement that Mr. Badgerow had given
    to police after arrest – but before he was aware of the DNA evidence – in which
    he denied knowing or recognizing Ms Werendowicz.  The jury convicted Mr. Badgerow on April 13,
    2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Mr. Badgerow appealed his conviction to
    this court in 2008.  Though four grounds
    of appeal were submitted, Simmons J.A. needed only to consider one that she
    found dispositive: she found that the police breached Mr. Badgerow’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights in obtaining the
    statement and concluded that the statement should have been excluded under s.
    24(2).  In reasons released on September
    5, 2008, she set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The retrial commenced on February 22, 2010, and the
    parties expect it to continue until June 2010.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;page-break-after:avoid;
'><b>Prior
    Unsuccessful Bail Applications</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;page-break-after:avoid'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Mr. Badgerow first applied for bail
    several months after his arrest, in March 1999.  Yates J. of the Ontario Court (General Division) denied his
    application.  He noted evidence before
    the court that described Mr. Badgerow’s personality as “aggressive, pugnacious,
    troublemaker, weird, bizarre, crude, vindictive [and] prone to violent
    behaviour both at work and elsewhere.”  He also noted that Mr. Badgerow, as a shift worker, “experiences sleep
    problems, which would cause him to go out walking or bike riding late at night
    and into the early morning, and during this period he was known to have prowled
    into people’s yards and peeped into their windows.”  In light of this evidence, Yates J. decided
    that Mr. Badgerow had failed to show cause why his detention in custody would
    not have been justified under s. 515(10); indeed, he was not persuaded on any
    of the three grounds therein.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      After failing in a subsequent bail review
    at trial, Mr. Badgerow remained in custody through his trial, through the
    interim between his conviction at trial and his appeal, and through his
    appeal.  This totalled over ten years in
    custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><b>Successful Bail Application and Conditions
    of Release</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      After this court set aside Mr. Badgerow’s
    conviction, he applied for bail pending the new trial.  This application came before Crane J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice.  As well as the
    evidence as to Mr. Badgerow’s personality that was before Yates&nbsp;J., Crane
    J. also heard <i>viva voce </i>evidence from
    a correctional guard who described Mr. Badgerow as a “model inmate” and from
    Mr. Badgerow’s five proposed sureties: his father, his mother, his brother, his
    sister, and his brother-in-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      On July 24, 2009, Crane J. granted bail to
    Mr. Badgerow pending his retrial.  Strict
    conditions, he reasoned, could address the concerns underlying each of the
    three grounds for justifying ongoing detention in s. 515(10).  In reviewing the grounds, Crane J. further
    noted:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>(1)       <span class=GramE>that</span> Mr.
    Badgerow “has had the opportunity to be matured by ten years of imprisonment”
    and that he “would not appear to have access to the financial means for
    flight”;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>(2)       <span class=GramE>that</span> the
    evidence against Mr. Badgerow on his murder charge is not susceptible to
    interference and that the risk to the sureties’ “life savings” would supply
    substantial motivation to prevent “any physical separation from a surety [as] a
    breach of a recognizance”; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>(3)       that, while the offence is “most grave”
    and subject to a lengthy term of imprisonment, the case against him, though strong,
    is not certain and the 30 years elapsed suggest that the “community and its
    media have gone on to many other alarms since then”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>As
    to the sureties, who pledged a total of $450,500 representing their life
    savings, Crane&nbsp;J. was “impressed with each”, describing them as “good
    people who are in a position to know [Mr. Badgerow]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Among other conditions of release, Crane
    J. required: that alarm systems be installed in each surety’s residence where
    Mr. Badgerow would sleep to prevent his leaving at night undetected; that Mr.
    Badgerow be in the presence of a surety at all times during his waking hours;
    and that Mr. Badgerow report to the Hamilton police every Thursday between 9:00
    a.m. and 9:00 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><b>The Failure to Report</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 24, 2009, a Thursday, Mr. Badgerow spent
    Christmas Eve at his sister’s home with four of his sureties: his mother and
    siblings, but not his father.  For the
    first time, Mr. Badgerow did not report to the police during the set window
    that day and the police contacted Mr. Badgerow’s father.  Mr. Badgerow’s father passed the information
    on to Mr. Badgerow, whose sister drove him to the police station where he reported
    at 9:40 p.m.  Mr. Badgerow explained and
    continues to maintain that he and his sureties simply forgot that it was a
    Thursday in light of the emotion and excitement of the first Christmas Eve
    family gathering since Mr Badgerow’s release after over ten years in prison.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police allowed Mr. Badgerow to sign in and to leave
    with his surety.  However, five days
    later, on December 29, a police officer attended at Mr. Badgerow’s father’s
    residence and told the father that Mr. Badgerow would be “breached for being
    late.”  According to the officer, Mr.
    Badgerow’s father replied: “For being 40 minutes late?”  The officer arrested Mr. Badgerow, who
    cooperated with the arrest, and charged him with failing to comply with his
    recognizance under s. 145(3).  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Bail Revocation under Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the interim before trial on the s. 145(3) charge, the
    Crown also applied pursuant to s.&nbsp;524(4) to revoke Mr. Badgerow’s bail on
    his murder charge.  Ramsay J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice heard the application on January 4, 2010.  The Crown and Mr.&nbsp;Badgerow’s counsel
    jointly agreed to proceed on a paper record of both police notes and reports
    and written statements.  These included
    statements from all of Mr.&nbsp;Badgerow’s sureties except his mother.  Each of the sureties’ statements supported
    Mr. Badgerow’s explanation for his failing to report on time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ramsay J. first looked to the Crown’s onus to show that
    Mr. Badgerow contravened his recognizance.  Noting that Mr. Badgerow admitted to failing to report as required,
    Ramsay J. framed Mr. Badgerow’s position on this point as follows: “He says
    that in the excitement of his first Christmas Eve with his family in eight
    years, he forgot that it was Thursday.  He does not allege an excuse.  Rather, he says that he lacked the <i>mens
    rea</i> for the offence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ramsay J. noted that Mr. Badgerow’s father, when asked
    what had happened on December 24 in a witness statement to police, answered, in
    part: “Robert’s mother decided to take him to sign in instead of myself.  He was given the OK to stay at his sister’s
    home for Christmas Eve and Christmas day.”  Ramsay J. inferred, from this: “I take from the father’s statement that
    it was [Mr. Badgerow’s] mother who had adverted to the fact that it was
    Robert’s sign-in day, and she who was supposed to drive him to the police
    station.”  He continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find it implausible that a man in the accused
    person’s position, having reported every Thursday for some months, would forget
    what day of the week it was, even if it was Christmas Eve.  It is also inconsistent with the evidence
    that his mother, the bondsman who was that day responsible for driving him to
    the police station, adverted to the fact that it was Thursday and must have
    communicated with his father about it.  I
    do not believe that the accused forgot that it was Thursday.  I do not believe him and I do not believe his
    bondsmen….  I do infer that the father
    and mother communicated with each other about the need to report on Christmas
    Eve.  I am satisfied that the accused did
    not forget in the excitement about spending Christmas with his family.  I find that for whatever motive, he decided
    to push his luck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ramsay J. then addressed whether Mr. Badgerow
    nevertheless showed <span class=GramE>cause</span> why he should not be
    detained.  On this point, Ramsay J.
    stated that while “Crane J. did trust the sureties”, “[g]iven the circumstances
    as they now exist, I do not.  Either they
    were negligent or they colluded with the accused.”  For Ramsay J., the breach undermined the
    order’s ability to address the primary and secondary grounds for justifying
    detention: “whether … a minor breach or not”, “it casts doubt on the feasibility
    of the existing release order to ensure the appearance of the accused and the
    protection of the public”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ramsay J. granted the application, revoked Mr.
    Badgerow’s bail and ordered that he be detained in custody.  That is the order from which Mr. Badgerow now
    appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><b>Fresh Evidence: Trial and Acquittal on the
    s. 145(3) <span class=GramE>Charge</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 20, 2010, after the revocation decision of
    Ramsay J., Mr. Badgerow was tried before Takach J. in the Ontario Court of
    Justice for failure to comply with his reporting condition.  Takach J. heard <i>viva voce</i> evidence on the failure to report on December 24,
    2009.  Mr. Badgerow now seeks to
    introduce the transcript of the proceedings before Takach J. as fresh evidence,
    which the Crown opposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, Mr. Badgerow’s father testified that the
    discussion between Mr.&nbsp;Badgerow’s parents regarding responsibility for
    taking Mr. Badgerow to report on Christmas Eve had taken place two or three
    days earlier and the two did not discuss it again.  For Mr. Badgerow, as appellant, this counters
    any possible inference by Ramsay&nbsp;J. that this conversation took place on the
    day of the breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Takach J. acquitted Mr. Badgerow.  Looking to the necessary <i>mens rea</i> of the offence, which required the Crown to show at least
    wilful blindness or recklessness, Takach J. found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the very least, his testimony raises a
    reasonable doubt on the critical issue.  He stated simply that he forgot.  It is apparent that, by inference, from the evidence, that his mother
    also forgot…  In my view, it’s not
    unreasonable that he forget, having regard to the time of the year and the
    juxtaposition of Thursdays in connection with Christmas.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After so ruling, the Crown asked for a certificate of
    default under s. 770 to note the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of failing to report.  Accepting the
    request, Takach J. endorsed the recognizance “with the indication that there
    was a default, that the reason for the default was forgetfulness on the part of
    the accused”.  Moreover, Takach J.
    stated: “Clearly, as I have said, my finding should be clear that I accept his
    evidence, at least on the basis of raising a reasonable doubt, that he simply
    forgot about it, forgot about the requirement to appear on the day in question
    because he did not think it was a Thursday.”  Mr.&nbsp;Badgerow also seeks to submit Takach J.’s ruling and these subsequent
    statements as fresh evidence on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><b>Fresh Evidence: Bail Application before
    Trial Judge</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 3, 2010, Mr. Badgerow applied to the
    assigned trial judge on his murder charge, Taylor J., for an order to vacate
    Ramsay J.’s detention order pursuant to s.&nbsp;523(2)(a).  He sought to put <i>viva voce</i> evidence from the sureties before Taylor J.  However, Taylor J. determined, based on <i>R. v. Robinson</i> (2009), 95 O.R. (3d) 309
    (C.A.), that the hearing was not <i>de novo</i> and that he could not substitute his view for Ramsay J.’s view; rather, he
    could only consider evidence of a significant or material change in
    circumstances subsequent to Ramsay J.’s order.  He determined: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It should not be open to Robert Badgerow, having
    decided to proceed before Ramsay J. on the basis of written material, to now
    seek to have me consider, in the form of <i>viva
    voce</i> evidence, the same evidence that was before Ramsay J.  Similarly, it should not be open to Robert
    Badgerow to now seek to present evidence before me that was available to be
    called before Ramsay J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>Accordingly,
    Taylor J. ruled that Mr. Badgerow could only lead evidence of changed

    at the family gathering simply forgot.  Again, Mr. Badgerow seeks to have the transcript before and ruling of

    Mr. Badgerow applied to this court to review Ramsay J.’s ruling pursuant to s.
    680.  Pursuant to s. 680(1), Blair J.A.,
    sitting as the Chief Justice’s designate, directed that this court consider the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal under s. 680(1) of the <i>Code</i> involves two issues: (1) Should the decision of Ramsay J. that
    the appellant and his sureties were deliberate in his failure to report on
    Christmas Eve and that his bail should be revoked on that basis be set aside? (2)&nbsp;If
    so, has the appellant shown <span class=GramE>cause</span> why he should be
    granted bail?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 680(1) of the <i>Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>680(1)              A decision made by a judge under s. 522 or
    subsection 524(4) or (5) or a decision made by a judge of the court of appeal
    under s. 261 or 679 may, on the direction of the chief justice or acting chief
    justice of the court of appeal, be reviewed by that court and that court may,
    if it does not confirm the decision,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            a) <span class=GramE>vary</span> the decision; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b) <span class=GramE>substitute</span> such other decision as, in its opinion, should have been made.</p>
  <p>Section
    524(4) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>524(4)              <span class=GramE>Where</span> an accused
    described in paragraph 3(a) is taken before a judge and the judge finds</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    the accused has contravened or had been about to contravene his … recognizance,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>he shall cancel the …recognizance and order that
    the accused be detained in custody unless the accused, having been given a reasonable
    opportunity to do so, shows cause why his detention in custody is not justified
    within the meaning of subsection 515(10).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Daniels</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 737, this court considered the proper operation and
    application of s. 680, albeit in the context of a Crown appeal from an order of
    this court granting bail pending appeal. Doherty J.A. described the “broad
    remedial powers” of the court of appeal under this section at para. 26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>The
    broad remedial powers found in s. 680(1) do not suggest that the review
    provided by s. 680 is other than an appellate review. The power to “vary” in s.
    680(1)(a) refers to the reviewing court's power to make the same type of order
    as was made at the initial hearing but to vary the specifics of that order. For
    example, the reviewing court could hold that an appellant was properly released
    on bail but alter the conditions of that release. The power to “substitute”
    found in s. 680(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) recognizes that the reviewing
    court may make an entirely different order than that made on the initial bail
    application. For example, when the reviewing court determines that bail should
    have been refused, it substitutes an order dismissing the application for bail
    for the initial order granting bail. It is noteworthy that while s. 680(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) gives the reviewing court a wide authority, it still
    directs that the court make the order which should have been made on the s. 679
    application. The broad remedial powers found in s. 680(1) arm the reviewing
    court with the authority to make any order which could have been made on the
    initial application. Arguably those with powers imply a correctness standard on
    review. They do not, however, alter the appellate nature of the process
    contemplated by s. 680: R. v. M. (S.H.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446 at pp. 464-66, 50
    C.C.C. (3d) 503 at pp. 548-49.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also held at para. 29 that when exercising its
    appellate jurisdiction under this section, the court can hear fresh evidence of
    a change in circumstances and use that evidence in determining the appropriate
    order, even though the court on review is making the order that should have
    been made on the original application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, following the s. 524(4) proceeding before
    Ramsay J., a breach hearing was held where Takach J. dismissed the charge on
    the basis that he accepted the appellant’s evidence, at least on the basis of a
    reasonable doubt, that he forgot to report on Christmas Eve, forgetting that it
    was a Thursday. On that hearing, there was also evidence from the appellant’s
    father, one of his sureties, that the conversation he had with the appellant’s
    mother where they agreed that she would be the one to take the appellant to
    report on Christmas Eve did not occur, as Ramsay J. may have inferred, on that
    day, but a few days earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the findings of Takach J., made based on <i>viva voce</i> testimony and not only on the
    paper record before Ramsay J., are properly admitted as fresh evidence on the
    s. 680 application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having admitted the fresh evidence, in my view, the
    conclusion of Ramsay J. that the appellant and his sureties acted deliberately or
    in collusion when they failed to ensure that he report on Christmas Eve cannot
    stand. The appellant and his sureties gave an explanation for what occurred.
    That explanation was un-contradicted and was further explained before Takach J.
    Furthermore, the appellant had reported faithfully every Thursday until that
    day. His sureties have a very significant amount to lose in the event of a
    breach where a judge finds <i>mens rea</i>,
    including recklessness or wilful blindness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the sole basis for Ramsay J.’s finding
    that the appellant had not shown cause was  his conclusion that the appellant had acted deliberately in failing to
    appear and that his sureties could no longer be trusted to supervise him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in light of the fresh evidence and my
    conclusions based on it, the correct result is that I do not confirm the
    decision of Ramsay J. Under subsection (b), I can then substitute the decision
    that should have been made.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an unusual case from a procedure and timing
    point of view, because this appeal was heard after the new trial commenced, and
    therefore, while the appellant is before the trial judge and under his
    jurisdiction. In those circumstances, I raised with counsel whether the
    appropriate order for this court would be to refer the show cause issue to the
    trial judge. This would certainly be consistent with this court’s preferred
    approach, as expressed in cases such as <i>R.
    v. Ranger</i> (2003), 180 O.A.C. 138, and <i>R.
    v. Durrani</i> (2008), 94 O.R. (3d) 350, when the trial has not yet begun.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant took the position that under
    s. 680, this court does not have the option as one of the allowed
    substitutions, to remit the show cause decision to the trial judge. He also
    argued that in the circumstances of this case, such an order would not serve
    the interests of justice. He relies on the recent procedural history where
    following the decision of Takach J.<span class=GramE>,</span> the appellant
    first moved before Taylor J., the trial judge (but before the trial had started)
    for a new bail order. On that motion, the Crown opposed the jurisdiction of
    Taylor J. on the basis that the appellant should have pursued <span
class=GramE>a</span> s. 680 application for review of Ramsay J.’s order or
    concede the correctness of that decision. Taylor J. accepted that position. The
    appellant submits that having then obtained leave from the Chief Justice’s
    designate, and proceeded with this <span class=GramE>review,</span> it is in
    the interests of justice that he now receive the decision from this court. He
    also points to the fact that the trial is proceeding from Monday to Thursday
    each week and it would possibly cause the trial judge to have to disrupt that
    schedule to conduct a show cause hearing.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am persuaded by the appellant that in the
    circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that this court make the decision
    under s. 680(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) and not refer it to the trial
    judge. Besides the arguments made by counsel, another reason that has persuaded
    me is that in this case, there are no new circumstances that may require a show
    cause hearing with <i>viva voce</i> or other
    new evidence. Rather, the decision is to be made on the record subject to one
    matter raised by the Crown which I will refer to below. This does not in any
    way preclude the bail issue from being revisited before the trial judge if new
    circumstances arise. Because of this decision, it is unnecessary for me to
    decide whether this court has the power to refer the show cause decision to the
    trial judge in the appropriate case.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I indicated above, the sole basis for Ramsay J.’s
    conclusion that the appellant had not shown cause was his view that the
    appellant’s conduct in failing to report was deliberate and that the sureties
    were complicit and could no longer be trusted. There was no other change from
    the record before Crane J. Based on the fresh <span class=GramE>evidence,</span> I accept that the appellant forgot to report on Christmas Eve, as he testified,
    as did the sureties. The question before me therefore is: is the appellant’s
    negligent failure to report on Christmas Eve sufficient cause to revoke his
    bail? In my view, based on the record before Crane J., the appellant has shown
    cause to be entitled to continue his previous bail. Having only once forgotten
    to report on a special occasion, and having reported upon being reminded, and
    being under the very stringent conditions imposed by Crane J. as well as the
    surety bonds posted or pledged by the sureties along with the alarm system that
    was installed to ensure that the appellant could not leave the home where he
    was staying without a surety, in my view, the appellant has shown cause why he
    should not be detained in accordance with the reasons of Crane J. granting him
    bail pending his new trial. Before reaching a final conclusion, however, I must
    address the fresh evidence application of the respondent.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent seeks to introduce fresh evidence following
    the argument on this review motion. It is new evidence that the Crown just
    learned from a man who says he agreed to assist the appellant following his
    arrest in 1999 by removing what appeared to be store-bought sex video tapes
    from the appellant’s attic and throwing them in the garbage. I agree with the
    appellant that on its face, this proposed fresh evidence, without more, is not
    relevant to my decision on the show cause. However, I also agree with the
    appellant that the Crown is not precluded from relying on this new evidence and
    seeking to elaborate on it if it wishes to bring a s. 523(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    application for detention before the trial judge.<i></i></p>
  <h3>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this s. 680(1) review application, the decision of
    Ramsay J. is set aside and an order shall go for bail in accordance with the
    conditions contained in the original recognizance ordered by Crane J. on July
    24, 2009, together with any additional conditions or variations that may be properly
    requested by the Crown, in which event, I may be spoken to.</p>
