style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant pled guilty to several
    charges.  He was sentenced to 12 months
    incarceration, in addition to five and one-half months credit for his
    pre-sentence custody.   The appellant was also placed on probation for
    two years, received the mandatory minimum ten-year weapons prohibition, and was
    required to provide a DNA sample.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant filed a prisoner’s notice of
    appeal against the sentence imposed, expressly acknowledging his guilt on the charges
    to which he had pled guilty.  Subsequently,
    with the assistance of duty counsel, the appellant requested an extension of
    time to appeal his conviction.  On that
    application, the appellant argued that his guilty pleas were not valid and
    should be set aside.  An extension of
    time was granted and the appeal became an appeal from both conviction and
    sentence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The validity of the guilty pleas was the only
    issue raised on the conviction appeal.  The
    appellant filed an affidavit in support of his request that the pleas be set
    aside.  The Crown filed the affidavit of the
    appellant’s trial counsel, Richard John Linley.  Both the appellant and Mr. Linley were cross-examined on their
    affidavits.  On the sentence appeal, the
    appellant contended that the trial judge erred in principle by imposing a
    sentence that gave undue weight to the factors of denunciation and general
    deterrence.  The appellant requested that
    the sentence be varied to time served, the equivalent of nine months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court dismissed
    the conviction appeal, allowed the sentence appeal, and varied the sentence to
    time served.  These are the reasons for
    those dispositions.  </p>

    pleas is taken from the trial record and Mr. Linley’s affidavit.  Although Mr. Linley and the appellant
    disagree as to what was said on certain occasions, there is no significant
    dispute as to the chronology.  In any
    event, I accept Mr. Linley’s recollection of the chronology of the various client
    meetings, as his recollection is supported by detailed notes.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On September 29, 2007, the appellant and a
    bouncer became engaged in an altercation outside of a bar.  The appellant was charged with one count of
    assault and one count of causing a disturbance.  He was released by the officer in charge on his own undertaking, which
    included a condition that he <span class=GramE>abstain</span> from the
    consumption of alcohol.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 6, 2007, a week later, the appellant
    was found consuming alcohol in contravention of his undertaking.  He was charged with breaching his undertaking,
    and released on his own recognizance.  That recognizance contained a curfew and a drinking prohibition.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant retained Mr. Linley in October
    2007.  Mr. Linley met with the appellant
    on November 11, 2007, to discuss the charges.  It was understood between Mr. Linley and the appellant that the
    appellant wanted to go to trial on the assault charge, claiming self-defence or
    the defence of his friend.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On December 15, 2007, the appellant became
    involved in another melee.  During this
    altercation, the appellant picked up a metal baseball bat and struck the victim
    over the head.  The appellant claimed
    that he did so to help a friend who was being choked by the victim.  The appellant was charged with aggravated
    assault, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and
    three counts of breaching his release orders.  Not surprisingly, given that he was already on two release orders, the appellant
    was detained for a bail hearing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley appeared for the appellant in bail
    court on December 17, 2007.  He explained
    to the appellant that the onus was now on him to show why he should be released,
    and that he would need someone who was prepared to act as a surety and allow
    the appellant to reside with him or her.  Mr. Linley spoke to the appellant’s mother on December 18, but his
    parents were unwilling to act as sureties as they were leaving the country on
    vacation.  Neither the appellant nor his parents
    suggested anyone else who might be prepared to act as the appellant’s
    “residential” surety.  The bail hearing
    was adjourned on consent until January 2008.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As of January 14, 2008, no potential sureties were
    available.  Although the appellant’s
    parents had returned from their holidays, they were not prepared to act as
    sureties.  The appellant had been in custody
    for about four weeks.  This was the first
    time he had ever been in jail, and he was having problems coping with
    incarceration.  According to the
    appellant, he was assaulted while in custody.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 14, 2008, Mr. Linley received Crown disclosure
    relating to the December 15 charges.  The
    disclosure included statements from various participants and witnesses of the
    relevant events.  There was also a
    videotaped statement given by the appellant to the police after he had been cautioned
    and had spoken to counsel.  In that
    statement, the appellant admitted that he had hit the victim over the head with
    a bat.  He said he did so because that
    person was choking his friend.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 23, 2008, Mr. Linley met with the
    appellant at the jail.  He explained that
    in his opinion the appellant did not have any valid legal justification for
    hitting the victim.  Mr. Linley told the
    appellant that the best course was to offer a plea of guilty to the included
    offence of assault causing bodily harm, as well as guilty pleas on the charges
    relating to the breach of the release orders.  Mr. Linley explained to the appellant how guilty pleas could mitigate
    sentence.  He also told the appellant that
    they could proceed to trial on the charges if that is what the appellant wanted.  Mr. Linley’s contemporaneous notes of the
    meeting include the following: “I tell him he does not have to plea – he can go
    to trial and see what happens.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 24, 2008, Mr. Linley met with the
    Crown Attorney.  The Crown suggested guilty
    pleas to some of the outstanding charges, including a guilty plea to a charge
    of assault causing bodily harm on the aggravated assault charge.  The Crown proposed, however, to proceed by
    indictment on the assault causing bodily harm charge, meaning there would be a
    mandatory weapons prohibition of at least ten years included in the
    sentence.  The Crown advised Mr. Linley
    that he would ask for a sentence in the range of 15 months in addition to any time
    spent in custody by the appellant prior to sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The same day, Mr. Linley had a brief telephone
    conversation with the appellant.  The appellant
    said he wanted to go to trial.  There was
    no discussion about the merits of his case in this brief call.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was due in court on January 28,
    2008.  On that day, prior to the court appearance,
    Mr. Linley met with the appellant.  He
    again explained that he thought it was very unlikely that the appellant could
    be acquitted on the assault charge involving the baseball bat.  Mr. Linley acknowledged that the appellant
    had difficulty accepting that he was criminally culpable, because in his mind he
    did not think he had done anything wrong in assisting his friend.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley and the appellant offered different
    versions of what happened during their conversation prior to court on January
    28, 2008.  Mr. Linley contends that he
    explained the Crown’s proposed global resolution, advised of what he thought
    would happen if the appellant pleaded guilty to the charges offered by the
    Crown, made sure the appellant understood that the sentence was ultimately for
    the trial judge, and explained to the appellant that the sentence would include
    a mandatory weapons prohibition.  Mr.
    Linley also reminded the appellant that it was his choice to plead guilty or
    not guilty.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley did not encourage the appellant to go
    to trial as he thought it was in the appellant’s best interests to plead guilty
    to the charges on which the Crown was prepared to accept guilty pleas.  Mr. Linley testified that the appellant
    struggled with the decision, but decided to plead guilty.  A short time later, the appellant was before
    the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to the appellant, he was “pushed to
    plead guilty” throughout the process after he was jailed on December 15, 2007.  In his affidavit, he asserts that he was
    never told anything about the Crown’s position, but was assured that if he pled
    guilty he would get out of jail, if not immediately, then certainly within a month
    or two at most.  According to the
    appellant, he was “completely shocked” when he was not released from custody after
    his guilty pleas.  The appellant insists
    that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to consider his options.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b>Were the Pleas Valid?</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A guilty plea is valid if it is unequivocal,
    voluntary and informed.  An informed
    guilty plea is one made with an appreciation of the nature of the allegations
    made, the legal effect of the guilty plea, and the consequences of that plea: see <i>R. v. T<span class=GramE>.(</span>R.)</i> (1992)<span class=GramE>,  10</span> O.R.
    (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 519; s. 606(1.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant advances two arguments
    in support of her claim that the pleas were not valid.  First, she contends that the transcript of
    the proceedings in which the guilty pleas were entered reveals that the pleas
    were neither voluntary, nor unequivocal.  Second, counsel submits that if the transcript alone is insufficient to
    demonstrate the invalidity of the guilty pleas, the fresh evidence offered on
    appeal, particularly the appellant’s affidavit and cross-examination as well as
    the admissions made by trial counsel, demonstrates the invalidity of the
    pleas.  I will consider each submission
    in turn, beginning with a review of the proceedings at which the appellant
    entered his guilty pleas.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the January 28, 2008 proceeding, the trial
    judge began by specifically asking the appellant whether he proposed to plead
    guilty to each of the five charges as she described them.  The trial judge gave a brief description of
    each charge.  Following each description,
    the appellant stated that it was his intention to plead guilty.  The following exchange ensued:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:  Have you made those decisions voluntarily?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:  <u>By

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u>Not entirely, <span class=GramE>Your</span> Honour, but I think it is the best way.  </u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:  It
    is really important that I be sure that this is a voluntary plea.  Would you like to discuss that matter with
    your client in a little bit more detail?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Linley:  I
    think it has been a difficult decision, but I think it is a decision he has
    made.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After this exchange, Mr. Linley and the
    appellant had a brief, private conversation in the courtroom.  Mr. Linley then told the court:  “I have addressed that again with him, Your
    Honour.  The question could be put to him
    again if you wish.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Court asked Mr. Linley if the appellant’s
    decision to plead guilty was voluntary.  Mr. Linley replied that no pressure had been put on the appellant, but
    that it “is not an easy decision to make.  There are many facts and circumstances”. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge spoke directly to the appellant
    and asked whether the decision to plead guilty was being made voluntarily.  The appellant replied “Yes, <span
class=GramE>Your</span> Honour”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge then put a series of questions
    to the appellant designed to ensure that the pleas were voluntary and informed.  The appellant specifically acknowledged that
    he understood that by pleading guilty he was admitting that he had committed
    all of the offences and was waiving his right to a trial.  The appellant specifically acknowledged that
    he had reviewed with his lawyer the facts that the Crown would be relying on in
    support of the charges.  The appellant
    also told the judge that his counsel had explained the consequences of entering
    a guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Court asked counsel whether the Crown had
    provided a position on sentence.  Counsel
    for the appellant indicated that “a range” had been given.  The trial judge then addressed the appellant
    directly as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You should be aware that these offences - -
    obviously you are in custody, <u>you understand that a jail sentence is a
    strong consideration on sentencing and you should be aware that if the Crown
    has given you a position on sentence, that is something I take into account
    just as I take your lawyer’s submissions into account.  The sentence may be different than what the
    lawyer suggests and it may be longer than what - - the jail sentence may be
    longer than what is sought by the Crown.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant specifically indicated that he
    understood what the trial judge had just explained to him, and the following
    exchange ensued:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:  So
    knowing that do you still wish to plead guilty?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes, <span class=GramE>Your</span> Honour.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:  Do
    you have any questions for Mr. Linley before you do so?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No, <span class=GramE>Your</span> Honour.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant then entered guilty pleas to the
    five charges on which the Crown had indicated it would proceed.  The Crown read in facts in support of the
    charges.  Mr. Linley added some mitigating
    detail in respect of the assaults.  The
    matter was adjourned to March for sentencing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley spoke to the appellant on the phone
    in February.  The appellant seemed
    confused and regretted his guilty plea.  Mr. Linley also spoke to the appellant on March 2, 2008, the day before
    sentencing.  The appellant was concerned
    about the potential effect of a weapons prohibition on his ability to join the
    Armed Forces.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sentencing proceeded on March 3, 2008.  Mr. Linley urged the court to impose a
    sentence of time served, to be followed by probation.  The Crown asked for a sentence of 18 to 24
    months, with five and one-half months credit for pre-trial incarceration.  Ultimately, the trial judge imposed a
    sentence of 12 months in addition to the pre-trial custody.  She also placed the appellant on probation
    for two years and imposed the mandatory ten-year minimum weapons
    prohibition.  The appellant was also
    ordered to provide a DNA sample.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A review of the entirety of the trial
    proceedings reveals no basis upon which to question the validity of the
    appellant’s guilty pleas.  The trial
    judge conducted a careful and comprehensive plea inquiry before accepting the guilty
    pleas.  The facts as read in by the Crown
    fully supported those pleas.  The trial
    judge addressed all of the matters referred to in s. 606(1.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in clear and simple
    terms.  She put questions directly to the
    appellant and received clear unequivocal responses from him.  The trial judge gave the appellant every
    opportunity to speak up if he had concerns about his pleas.  She offered him an opportunity to speak to
    his lawyer before proceeding with the pleas.  By the time the pleas were entered, there was no reason to doubt their
    validity.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant contends that the
    appellant’s indication to the trial judge that his plea was “not entirely”
    voluntary demonstrates that the plea was invalid.  However, the appellant’s comment cannot be
    considered in isolation.  After he made
    that remark, he spoke with his lawyer.  He then gave several clear and unequivocal answers to questions put to
    him by the trial judge, and declined the opportunity to have any further
    discussions with counsel.  Given the
    entirety of the record, this single utterance by the appellant raises no air of
    reality to his claim that his pleas were involuntary and coerced.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, even if one were to examine the exchange
    relied upon by counsel for the appellant in isolation, it does not demonstrate
    that the pleas were invalid.  In that
    passage, the appellant asserts that his decision to plead guilty to some of the
    charges was “not entirely” free of outside pressures.  He goes on to indicate that the guilty pleas
    are “the best way.”  It is hardly
    surprising that an accused who is being held in custody, <span class=GramE>who</span> is facing serious charges for which he has no defence and for which he will in
    all likelihood be incarcerated, will feel pressure at the time he is required
    to decide how to plead.  His further
    assertion that “I think it is the best way” reflects his consideration of the
    alternatives and his decision as to which course of action was best. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nothing in the record of the proceedings at
    trial warrants the conclusion that the pleas were invalid.  To the contrary, the record demonstrates that
    the pleas were voluntary, unequivocal and informed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><b><span style='"Times New Roman"'>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b>The
    Fresh Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant claims in his affidavit and
    cross-examination that he was coerced into pleading guilty by the circumstances
    and, to some extent, by the attitude of his trial lawyer.  I have no difficulty accepting that the
    appellant was under pressure at the time.  He was 21 years old, and in custody for the first time with no real
    prospect of release.  He was facing a
    series of criminal charges, one of which was a serious allegation.  His lawyer had informed him that he had no
    defence on that serious charge.  These
    factors no doubt weighed heavily on the appellant’s mind when he was trying to
    decide what to do.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the circumstances in which the
    appellant found himself were hardly unique, and are shared by many who must
    decide whether to plead guilty to criminal charges.  That decision by its very nature must be made
    when individuals are under considerable pressure.  That pressure is often the product of the
    grim realization that there is no viable alternative to a guilty plea, and that
    the consequences of a guilty plea will be immediate, serious and far-reaching.  The pressures inherent in the nature and
    timing of the decision to plead guilty cannot in and of themselves invalidate a
    guilty plea on appeal.  People are
    capable of deciding what is in their best interests even when they are under
    considerable pressure and none of the available options are attractive.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before turning to the appellant’s affidavit and cross-examination,
    I will address Mr. Linley’s testimony.   Much of what he said is supported by
    contemporaneous notes.  Further, Mr.
    Linley had nothing to gain by pressuring the appellant into pleading guilty.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley acknowledges that his relationship with
    the appellant could have been better.  He
    accepts that there were things he could have done differently to perhaps provide
    the appellant with more effective assistance.  For example, it might have been better had Mr. Linley suggested an
    adjournment on January 28, to allow the appellant some time to decide whether
    he wanted to plead guilty to the charges suggested by the Crown.  It might also have been better had Mr. Linley
    requested a brief adjournment after the appellant indicated to the trial judge
    that his pleas were “not entirely” pressure free.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The shortcomings in Mr. Linley’s performance do
    not, however, undermine the essential validity of the guilty pleas.  At best they demonstrate, with the benefit of
    hindsight, that Mr. Linley could have done more to afford the appellant a
    better opportunity to consider his options.  That conclusion does not, however, mean the pleas should be set aside.  The appellant must demonstrate the invalidity
    of the pleas, not merely that he could have been given a better opportunity to
    consider his position.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley frankly acknowledged that he told the
    appellant that in his view the appellant did not have a viable defence to the charge
    involving the assault with the baseball bat.  Mr. Linley also testified that the appellant had difficulty accepting
    this because in his mind it was appropriate for him to have come to the aid of
    his friend.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley cannot be criticized for advising the
    appellant, even in strong terms, of his opinion as to the merits of any proposed
    defence.  Mr. Linley owed his best advice
    to the appellant even if that advice was difficult for the appellant to accept.  The appellant’s difficulty in accepting Mr.
    Linley’s opinion no doubt explains his vacillation prior to the plea and his
    second thoughts after the plea.  That
    vacillation is not, however, a basis upon which to allow an accused to retract
    his guilty pleas on appeal.  I would add
    that on the facts of this case, I agree with Mr. Linley’s opinion that the
    appellant had no defence on the merits to the charge of assault causing bodily
    harm. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Linley’s candour during his
    cross-examination suggests to me a person who was doing his best to answer
    questions truthfully, rather than seeking to protect his own self-interest.  For that reason and the others set out above,
    I find Mr. Linley’s evidence credible and reliable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not find the appellant to be a credible
    witness.  After reading his cross-examination
    several times, I am compelled to agree with Crown counsel’s submission that the
    appellant was prepared to say almost anything that he thought would assist him in
    these proceedings.  Much of his evidence
    is irreconcilable with what he said when he entered his guilty pleas.  As his cross-examination proceeded, the appellant
    became more and more adamant that he had been told less and less.  By the end of his cross-examination, the appellant
    professed virtually total ignorance of all matters relating to his guilty
    pleas.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his cross-examination, the appellant offered
    a myriad of explanations for the answers he gave to the trial judge during her
    extensive plea inquiry.  The explanations
    changed, but they ultimately came down to the assertion that he did what he was
    told because he was assured he would get out of jail.  As the appellant put it when asked why he
    would mislead the trial judge with his answers, “I chose that I wanted to get
    out of jail.  That’s all I chose.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This explanation for answers given to the trial
    judge is incredible, particularly given that one of the questions made it clear
    that the matter of sentence would be decided by the trial judge and that “a
    jail sentence is a strong consideration on sentencing”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When pressed in cross-examination, the appellant
    repeatedly contradicted earlier answers he had given in his cross-examination.  Three examples will suffice:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In his
    affidavit, the appellant asserted that he spoke to Mr. Linley about laying
    charges against the bouncer arising out of the September assault.  When cross-examined on this assertion, the
    appellant gave three different answers in the space of less than two pages of
    transcript.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    appellant was cross-examined about whether he provided the name of his brother
    to Mr. Linley as a potential surety after the appellant’s arrest in December
    2007.  The appellant gave completely contradictory
    answers in the space of less than one page of transcript.  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    appellant was cross-examined about whether his mother attended at court and her
    willingness to act as a surety in December 2007.  He gave different answers at different stages
    of his cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not only did the appellant repeatedly vacillate
    during his cross-examination, many of his answers defy common sense.  For example, the appellant contends that he
    was told by Mr. Linley, before going into court, that he would be pleading guilty
    to all charges.  In fact, Mr. Linley and
    the Crown had already agreed that if the appellant pled guilty it would be to
    only some of the charges.  It makes no
    sense that Mr. Linley would lead his client to believe that he was going to
    plead guilty to all of the charges when he had already arranged pleas to some
    of the charges.  Furthermore, the
    appellant’s ready replies when the selected charges were put to him by the
    trial judge were entirely inconsistent with a person who believed he was
    pleading guilty to all of the charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s convoluted answers to questions
    about his understanding of the consequences of his guilty pleas afford another
    example of answers that defy common sense.  The appellant denied that he understood that he would have a criminal
    record if he pled guilty.  He also denied
    that he had any understanding of how a criminal record could affect his future.  These answers reflect the attitude of one who
    is prepared to go to any length to disavow even a rudimentary understanding of
    the consequences of a guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his cross-examination, the appellant added
    detail to the allegations he had set out in his affidavit.  For example, he alleged for the first time that
    he was physically forced into the courtroom on the day he pled guilty, by a
    police officer who threatened him with additional charges if he did not enter
    the courtroom.  This allegation, if true,
    would add substantial weight to the appellant’s claim that his pleas were not
    voluntary.  One would have thought that
    if the allegation had any truth, it would have appeared in the appellant’s
    affidavit and not emerged for the first time well into his
    cross-examination.  This embellishment has
    all the earmarks of an improvised fabrication made up to improve a story that was
    not weathering well under cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Perhaps most significantly, the overall tenor of
    the appellant’s cross-examination is that of a person who simply will not
    accept responsibility for his own conduct.  In his cross-examination, the appellant could not even bring himself to
    admit his guilt on the charges involving the breaches of the various court
    orders.  No one suggests he has any
    defence to those allegations.  The
    appellant quite obviously has come to see himself as a victim in this
    narrative.  That misperception has
    clearly skewed his recollection of the events and rendered his evidence
    unreliable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fresh evidence put forward on appeal

  <h2>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant pled guilty to assault, three counts
    of breaching release orders and one count of assault causing bodily harm.  The assault charge arose out of an
    altercation that occurred outside a bar on September 29, 2007.  One of the bar employees had grabbed the
    appellant to prevent him from assisting his friend who was engaged with another
    employee of the bar.  The appellant
    responded by striking the employee in the chin area three times with his
    elbow.  The employee released the
    appellant and he ran away.  The appellant
    was not involved at the commencement of the altercation, but came upon the
    scene to find that his friend had “got into difficulties” with one of the bar
    employees. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The three charges relating to breaches of release
    orders arose out of two separate incidents and involved the consumption of
    alcohol and the breach of curfew.  On
    October 6, 2007, the police found the appellant at a dance.  He appeared to have been drinking and
    admitted that he had consumed three beers.  Under the terms of the undertaking on which he had been released following
    the September incident, the appellant was required to abstain from the
    consumption of alcohol.  He was charged
    with breaching that undertaking and released.  The other two breach charges arise out of the events of December 15,
    2007.  The appellant was consuming
    alcohol in contravention of two release orders, and he was out past the curfew
    imposed by the October release order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is common ground that the assault committed on
    the bouncer in September was a minor one that, standing alone, would not have
    merited incarceration.  The breaches of the
    release orders are a more serious matter.  Those three charges taken together merited a short sharp jail term of approximately
    30 days.  Unfortunately for the
    appellant, he significantly upped the penal stakes when he committed the much
    more serious assault on December 15, 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the early morning hours of December 15, 2007,
    the appellant and others were consuming alcohol at a party in a residence.  A dispute occurred and the appellant was told
    to leave the residence.  He left only to
    be followed by two men, one of whom was carrying a metal baseball bat.  The appellant and the person carrying the bat
    had a confrontation some distance from the home.  The appellant took the bat away from the
    other individual and threw it on the ground.  Meanwhile, another fight had broken out.  A man named Armstrong, one of the men who had followed the appellant out
    of the home, had a friend of the appellant on the ground and was choking
    him.  The appellant picked up the
    baseball bat and struck Armstrong over the head with a downward blow.  He then fled the scene with the bat.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Armstrong was taken to the hospital, received
    seven stitches and was released.  Photographs filed by the Crown show a large gash on Armstrong’s
    head.  It does not appear that he
    suffered any significant long-term effects from the blow.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant turned 21 in December 2007.  He had never been charged with a criminal
    offence before the altercation with the bouncer in late September 2007. While the
    appellant initially did not do well in school, he overcame his problems to
    graduate from high school and successfully complete an eight-month mechanics
    course at community college.  Following
    that course, the appellant was employed as a mechanic, however, that job ended
    after three months.  He was unemployed in
    the fall of 2007 with the exception of weekend employment with the military
    reserve.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant wanted a career in the Canadian Armed
    Forces.  He had performed well with the
    reserves and had taken all of the steps necessary to apply to the regular Armed
    Forces.  His convictions, and particularly
    the ten-year mandatory minimum weapons prohibition, all but ended his hopes of
    joining the Armed Forces.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s family has remained supportive

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The pre-sentence report was quite favourable,
    although some concern was expressed about the appellant’s alcohol
    consumption.  The probation officer
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The subject appears to have some difficulty with
    problem-solving and common sense.  It
    would appear his actions of heavy drinking and negative associates prior to his
    enrolment in the Armed Forces were the result of poor judgment.  His continued lack of insight while on an Undertaking
    is somewhat more perplexing.  It appears
    with very clear direction and structure he can follow direction; however, he
    was not compliant with the Court ordered terms.  These issues would likely prove continued difficulty for Mr. Carty in
    the long term, if he does not attempt to resolve them.  </p>

    the time of sentencing.  The trial judge
    gave him credit for 160 days – or five and one-half months.  In imposing sentence, she referred to all of
    the relevant mitigating and aggravating circumstances.  The trial judge indicated she was giving the appellant
    credit for his guilty pleas, the absence of any record, his age, and the lack
    of pre-meditation.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge determined that the appellant
    should serve an additional 12 months resulting in an effective sentence of 17 ½
    months.  She assigned 12 months to the
    assault causing bodily harm charge and the remainder to the other four
    charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant, recognizing the
    limited scope of appellate review of sentencing, argues that the trial judge
    erred in principle when she said, “The paramount sentencing principles have to
    be denunciation and deterrence for these blatant breaches of court orders and
    for this level of violence.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel submits that given the appellant’s
    status as a first offender and his youth (20-21 at the time of the offences),
    the trial judge should not have treated denunciation and deterrence as the “paramount
    sentencing principles”.  Counsel acknowledges
    that both principles had roles to play in determining the appropriate sentences,
    but argues that rehabilitation should also have played a significant role.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel submits that the trial judge’s almost
    exclusive reliance on denunciation and deterrence as the operative principles
    is evident from the length of the sentence she imposed.  That sentence (17 ½ months) was only one-half
    of a month short of the range that the trial judge had described as appropriate
    in the circumstances, were it not for the appellant’s guilty plea, age and lack
    of prior record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Counsel
    submits that by discounting the sentence by less than a month, the trial judge
    gave the appellant’s rehabilitative prospects very little weight.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept counsel’s submissions.  While deterrence and denunciation were
    important given the nature of the offences, the rehabilitative prospects of the
    appellant were at least equally important.  An appropriate sentence should have reflected a blending of all three
    factors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the trial judge erred in principle, this
    court must determine the appropriate sentence.  I begin by agreeing with the trial judge’s determination that as of the
    date she imposed sentence, a sentence of time served (the equivalent of five
    and one-half months) would not have been appropriate.  The assault committed by the appellant with
    the baseball bat was a serious one.  Fortunately,
    the victim did not suffer any significant long-term injuries, although as the
    trial judge noted, that consequence is more the product of good luck than
    anything else.  However, without
    diminishing the seriousness of the assault, it must also be acknowledged that
    the appellant’s actions were spontaneous and involved a single blow delivered
    in circumstances that, while offering no justification or defence for his
    actions, do present an explanation with some mitigating value.  The appellant believed that his friend was
    being choked by the victim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bearing in mind the circumstances surrounding
    the offence of assault causing bodily harm, the appellant’s antecedents, his
    age, lack of criminal record, the serious impact of his convictions on his
    desire to join the Armed Forces, and his significant rehabilitative prospects,
    a sentence in the range of six to nine months would have been appropriate on
    the assault bodily harm charge.  The three
    breaches of the release orders taken together merited a consecutive sentence of
    about 30 days.  The assault charge arising
    out of the altercation with the bouncer is best addressed by a concurrent non-custodial
    term.  In total, an appropriate sentence
    for the appellant’s offences would have been in the range of seven to ten
    months.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant served three and one-half months
    before he was released on bail pending appeal.  Taking into account that incarceration plus the five and one-half months
    credited for pre-trial incarceration, the appellant has served an effective
    sentence of nine months.  He has been on
    bail pending appeal for about 20 months without any incident.  I see no value in re-incarcerating him now for
    a period of about 30 days.  A sentence of
    time served is appropriate at this stage.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentence appeal is allowed.  The sentence on the assault bodily harm
    charge is varied to time served (nine months) to be followed by two years
    probation on the terms fixed by the trial judge.  The mandatory minimum ten-year weapons
    prohibition made by the trial judge remains in effect, as does the DNA
    order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It would appear from my review of the
    informations that the sentences imposed on the other charges were all made
    concurrent to the assault causing bodily harm sentence, and that there is no
    need to vary those sentences to affect the immediate release of the appellant
    from custody.  I do not propose to vary
    those sentences.  To be clear, however,
    the intention of this disposition is that the appellant should not be required
    to serve any further period of incarceration on these charges.  </p>
