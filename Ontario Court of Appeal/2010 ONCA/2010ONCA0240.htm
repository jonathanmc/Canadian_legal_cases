  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a
    four-year-old child and, in the light of his lengthy prior record for similar
    offences, he was declared a dangerous offender and given a sentence of
    indeterminate detention in 1998.  At the
    1998 hearing, the trial judge concluded that on the evidence the appellant met
    the conditions for a long-term offender designation, but declared him a
    dangerous offender because at the time the offence was committed the long-term
    offender designation was not available.  This court reversed that decision in 2004 and ordered a new hearing
    which led to the designation now under appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the new hearing in 2005 before the same judge, the
    appellant led no new evidence but relied upon the evidence given at the first
    hearing.  The Crown called one witness
    who introduced as an exhibit the reports of Correctional Services of Canada (“CSC”)
    detailing the appellant’s seven-year custodial history following the first
    hearing. The appellant conceded that he presented a substantial risk to
    reoffend but urged the trial judge to designate him as a long-term rather than
    as a dangerous offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the evidence and concluded
    that he was “unconvinced, based on the material provided, that there is a
    reasonable possibility of the essential control of the risk that the offender
    will reoffend.  The long-term offender
    provision is not an appropriate determination”.</p>

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The CSC Reports</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As issues 1 and 2 are closely related, we deal with
    them together.  We do not accept the
    submission that the trial judge erred in relying on the CSC reports, which gave
    the appellant’s seven-year institutional history or that he misapprehended the
    contents of those reports. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellant’s counsel objected to the
    admissibility of opinions offered as to risk assessment contained in the CSC
    reports, he did not contest the admissibility of the reports themselves.  The trial judge admitted the reports and
    observed that if the appellant wished to contest any opinions as to risk, the
    authors of the reports could be brought before the court for examination.  That did not occur and during oral argument,
    counsel for the appellant argued that those reports indicated that the
    appellant had made considerable progress over the seven-year period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant takes particular issue with
    the trial judge’s use of a report completed by Dr. Willoughby and John Gresham.
     The appellant submits that the trial
    judge treated this as an expert report despite the fact that no proper
    foundation was laid for admitting it on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  In
    our view, that report cannot be properly characterized as an expert opinion
    report nor did the trial judge treat it as such.  As its title “Program Performance Report”
    indicates, it describes the various programs and treatments the appellant has
    undergone.  The trial judge was entitled
    to take into account the appellant’s institutional history as reflected in that
    report and other documents, and in particular, the fact that the appellant had
    done relatively poorly in the programs and that while pharmacological treatment
    had reduced his sex drive to some extent, he continued to have marked <span
class=SpellE>pedophilic</span> preferences that made any contact or access to
    children inappropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge did not treat the report
    as offering an opinion as to the risk posed by the appellant nor did he rely on
    the opinions expressed therein.  The
    trial judge referred to the “objective indicia” contained in the reports, by
    which we understand him to be referring to the facts contained in those
    reports, including the programs and treatment the appellant had undertaken and
    the results from both.  However, the
    trial judge was entitled to rely on the expert opinions offered at the 1998
    hearing.  The 1999 statement of Dr.
    Brinks referred to by the trial judge, in our view, did not materially add to
    the rest of the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that as the appellant had not
    made any significant progress toward suitability for living in the community
    with drug treatment, the prediction offered by Dr. Bradford at the first
    hearing that he might be managed through drugs had not been borne out.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Fresh
    Evidence</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have reviewed the updated report of Dr. Bradford
    proffered as fresh evidence. We are not satisfied that this report meets the
    fourth criterion of the <i>Palmer</i> test,
    namely, that when taken with the other evidence adduced it could reasonably be
    expected to have affected the result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While Dr. Bradford continues to be of the view that the
    appellant could be managed in the community, his updated report is considerably
    less optimistic than the report he filed at the first hearing.  Dr. Bradford now states that the appellant is
    in the highest of six categories for the risk of recidivism, that he continues
    to show <span class=SpellE>pedophilic</span> sexual preference, and that other
    features of his profile including antisocial personality disorder, lack of
    sexual knowledge, and substance abuse have an impact on the likelihood of
    future recidivism. Dr. Bradford’s opinion is based on what he acknowledges to
    be the appellant’s “last hope”, namely chemical castration, the most drastic
    form of pharmacological treatment.  The
    success of that treatment depends upon the appellant’s willingness to continue
    it and tolerate its drastic effects and possible side effects.  We were told during argument that the
    appellant has in fact commenced this treatment in the institution.  However, there is no evidence before us
    sufficient to indicate that this treatment, over time, offers a reasonable
    prospect for managing this appellant in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, given the serious risk the appellant
    continues to pose to public safety, the interests of justice do not favour
    admitting the fresh evidence and either making an LTO designation or ordering a
    new hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that this does not leave the appellant without
    hope should the drastic form of treatment he has apparently commenced prove
    successful, as his case can be reviewed on a regular basis by the Parole Board:
    see <i>R. v. T.L.</i> 2008 ONCA 766 at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.</p>
