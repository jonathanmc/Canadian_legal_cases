  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 17, 2006, officers from the Ontario Ministry
    of Transportation stopped a vehicle owned by Petrus Van Berlo as it was travelling
    along Blue Line Road in Norfolk County in southern Ontario.  As a result, Mr. Van Berlo was charged and
    convicted at trial by a Justice of the Peace of a number of charges under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8
    (“<i>HTA</i>”).  He was also acquitted of two charges under
    the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.25.  On appeal to the
    Ontario Court of Justice, the convictions were upheld and the acquittals were
    reversed.  With leave, Mr. Van Berlo
    appeals all his convictions to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of offences that require
    the vehicle in question to be a “motor vehicle”, such as permitting the
    operation of motor vehicle on a highway without a permit.  The definition of “motor vehicle” in the <i>HTA</i> excludes a “self-propelled implement
    of husbandry”.  Thus, the appeal turns on
    whether Mr. Van Berlo’s vehicle comes within this exception, as a
    self-propelled implement of husbandry.  If so, the parties agree that the appeal must succeed and the
    convictions must be set aside.  If not,
    the appeal fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “self-propelled implement of husbandry” is
    defined in s. 1.1 of the <i>HTA</i>.:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Self-propelled implement of husbandry” means a
    self-propelled vehicle manufactured, designed, redesigned, converted or
    reconstructed for a specific use in farming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This vehicle was clearly self-propelled.  The only question is whether it was
    “converted … for a specific use in farming”.  For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the appellant has not
    demonstrated that his vehicle meets the definition.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the vehicle in question was stopped on August 17,
    2006, it was towing a trailer loaded with irrigation pipes.  It was being driven by one of the appellant’s
    employees from a field on one of the appellant’s farms to another of his
    farms.  Two other employees were also on
    board.  All three were engaged in the
    picking up, transporting and laying of irrigation pipe used in the appellant’s
    farming operation.  The farms produce
    tobacco, sweet potatoes, ginseng, corn, beans and other crops, all of which
    require irrigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant purchased the vehicle on August 11, 2002
    for $2000.  It was a 1976 Chevrolet
    pick-up truck.  His intention was to
    modify it for use in his irrigation operations.  He then spent $16,000 on the vehicle so it could tow farm equipment from
    farm to farm and from field to field, and so it could be used in the fields for
    irrigation purposes.  He had the gasoline
    engine replaced with a diesel engine for more power.  The gearing was changed and the two-wheel
    drive was converted to four-wheel drive.  Large tread snow tires were installed to facilitate driving through
    fields of mud and sand.  Finally a hitch,
    ten times heavier than a regular trailer hitch, was installed at the rear of
    the vehicle to allow for the pulling of various pieces of farm equipment.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE JUDGMENTS BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of these facts, the Justice of the Peace
    found that the vehicle still looked like a pick-up truck but had been altered
    and modified to increase its versatility for farming tasks.  He concluded that it remained a Chevrolet
    pick-up truck.  It was a motor vehicle
    being used on a farm with alterations to make it more adaptable and useful on
    the farm.  He found it was not a
    self-propelled implement of husbandry, and therefore convicted the
    appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Ontario Court of Justice found that the
    modifications did not change the character of the vehicle and that it was still
    capable of being used for the purpose for which it was originally designed.  The court concluded at page 3 of its reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The modifications made to it may very well have
    made it easier for the appellant to use in his fields but it, in my opinion,
    never lost its true character of being a pick-up truck.  It is obvious that the vehicle was not
    manufactured or designed for a specific farm purpose nor could it be said that
    the modifications amounted to a redesign, conversion or reconstruction for a
    specific use in farming.  It is a pick-up
    truck which is now better able to be used in farm fields for farm tasks but it
    is still fully capable of being operated on a highway, albeit with some
    limitations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellant argues that the provincial
    court judge erred in law by reading into the definition of “self-propelled
    implement of husbandry” the requirement that the vehicle be incapable of being
    used for its original purpose.  He says
    that properly read, the vehicle meets the definition because it was only being
    used for irrigation operations in relation to farming, and that this was the appellant’s
    specific purpose for converting it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the Crown argues that the provincial
    court judge was correct because the vehicle does not meet the definition if, as
    here, it is capable of behaving like a motor vehicle on the highway.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>HTA</i> excludes a “self-propelled implement of husbandry” from the definition of
    “motor vehicle”.  If the appellant’s
    vehicle is a self-propelled implement of husbandry it escapes the requirements
    placed on a motor vehicle by the <i>HTA</i>.  Thus, the central issue in this appeal is how
    the statutory definition of “self-propelled instrument of husbandry” unpacks in
    the context of this case.  To repeat,
    that definition is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Self-propelled implement of husbandry” means a self-propelled
    vehicle manufactured, designed, redesigned, converted or reconstructed for a
    specific use in farming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper approach to statutory interpretation was set
    out in the well-known words adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes</i>, [1998] 1
    S.C.R. 27 at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one principle or approach,
    namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interpretive task required in this case must
    therefore be informed by the broad objective of the <i>HTA</i>.  Murray Segal has
    described its primary objective this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Act has many purposes.  It is first and foremost a collection of
    duties and obligations imposed on drivers in relation to the operation of
    vehicles, especially motor vehicles, to ensure the safety of motorists and
    others.  See <i>Harris v. Yellow Cab Ltd., </i>[1926] 3 D.L.R. 254 (Ont. C.A.).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important that the provision to be interpreted excludes
    a vehicle from the requirements that the <i>HTA</i> imposes on motor vehicles in order to achieve its objective.  This suggests that a narrower interpretive
    approach to the exception is necessary to avoid undermining the broad purpose
    of the legislation: see <i>Sullivan and
    Driedger</i> <i>on the Construction of Statutes</i>,
    4<sup>th</sup> ed., at pp. 396-397.  Moreover, s. 47(3) of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33, puts the onus on the appellant as
    defendant to bring this vehicle within the exception.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the statutory definition of a
    “self-propelled implement of husbandry”, there is no dispute that the
    appellant’s vehicle is self-propelled.  The appellant says that it comes within the exception because he “converted”
    it “for a specific use in farming” namely, the irrigation function needed for
    his farming operations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines “convert” as
    “to change into something different; to change in character or function; to
    transform.”  This definition suggests two
    things when applied to the statutory language in this case.  First, the change must be significant enough
    to transform the vehicle into something different.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, since the change must be enough to change the
    essential character of the vehicle, that suggests that the change must have an
    objective quality and that the subjective intention of the end user is not
    enough.  The need for change that is
    objectively apparent for a vehicle to be “converted for a specific use” is also
    consistent with the other ways that the statutory definition provides for a
    vehicle to come within this exception.  For example, a vehicle that is “manufactured” or “designed” for a
    specific use in farming has an objectively discernable character or function
    that does not depend at all on the particular use intended by the end
    user.  Thus, I do not agree with the
    appellant that the use intended by the appellant is what matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I also do not agree with the Crown that the exception
    requires that the vehicle be capable only of the specific use in farming for
    which it was manufactured or converted.  Section 7(2) of the <i>HTA</i> requires that a self-propelled implement of husbandry requires a permit when
    operated on a highway other than in relation to a specific use for which it was
    manufactured or converted.  Such a
    provision would be unnecessary if the exception required that the vehicle be
    incapable of any use (including its former use) other than the specific use
    that qualifies it for the exception.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, to be “converted for a specific use in
    farming” a vehicle must be changed significantly enough that, viewed
    objectively, its essential character or function has been transformed for that
    specific use, although it may retain some limited capacity for other
    functions.  The transformation cannot
    just be for general use in farming, it must be for a specific use.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When this interpretation is applied to the facts of
    this case, I conclude that the appeal must fail.  As the Ontario Court of Justice found, the
    changes made by the appellant really do not change the character of the
    vehicle.  The appellant installed a more
    powerful engine, changed the gearing, converted the vehicle from two to
    four-wheel drive, and installed large tread snow tires and a stronger rear
    hitch.  Whether taken separately or
    together, these modifications do not change the vehicle from a truck into
    something different.  Although these
    changes make the vehicle more powerful and therefore better able to perform
    some functions, such as pulling loads, these functions remain essentially the
    same.  Nor do the changes point to the
    specific use of irrigation.  At best,
    they are for general use in farming.  Viewed objectively rather than through the lens of the subjective
    intention of the appellant, the changes are neither significant enough to
    change the essential character or function of the vehicle, nor can they be
    described as for the specific use of irrigation in the appellant’s farming
    operation.  In other words, the appellant
    cannot bring the vehicle within the defined exception.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
