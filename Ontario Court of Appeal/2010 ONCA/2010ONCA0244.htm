  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would dismiss the appeal from conviction and
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no error in the trial judge’s ruling admitting
    the out-of-court statements of the witness, Z.  The trial judge admitted a statement given to the police by the witness,
    Z., the day after the accident that led to the charges.  The trial judge also admitted a transcript of
    the testimony of Z. given at the trial of one of the other individuals who was
    charged as a result of the same incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Z. was a “recanting witness”
    and that it was, therefore, “necessary” to admit the out-of-court statements.  In our view, this finding, which is
    essentially a finding of fact, was open to the trial judge on the evidence he
    heard on the <i>voir dire</i>.  We see no error in that finding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was abundant evidence that the out-of-court
    statements, both the statement taken by the police and the prior testimony,
    were sufficiently reliable to justify their admission under the principled
    approach to hearsay.  Perhaps most
    importantly, the witness, Z., was available for cross-examination at
    trial.  As was evident on the <i>voir dire</i>, Z. was only too anxious to
    accommodate and assist the defence in his testimony.  In our view, the availability of Z. for
    cross-examination, the fact that the out-of-court statements were recorded and
    that Z. volunteered the statement to the police knowing full well the potential
    criminal implications should he lie to the police, made the statements
    sufficiently reliable to justify their admission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the jury should not have been
    given a copy of the DVD containing the statement to the police during their
    deliberations.  We disagree.  The jury saw the DVD during the trial and it
    was marked as an exhibit.  The defence
    made much of the appearance of the witness Z. on the DVD in his closing.  Presumably, the jury requested the DVD so it
    could give full and careful consideration to the submissions that had been made
    to it by the defence.  There was no
    suggestion at trial that the jury should not be given a copy of the DVD to
    examine during their deliberations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the jury should have
    been cautioned to not put undue emphasis on the contents of the DVD and should
    have been given the transcript of the prior testimony of Z. and the transcript
    of his testimony at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It may be that had the trial judge been asked, he could
    have given the jury a caution not to put undue emphasis on the DVD.  Absent any such request, in our view, it is
    not reversible error to fail to do something that the trial judge was not asked
    to do.  Furthermore, we do not see how
    the added documentation now suggested by counsel for the appellant, as
    necessary for the jury’s deliberations would have helped them.  This is made evident by the absence of any
    such request at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the instruction on the
    essential elements of the crime of criminal negligence causing bodily harm was
    not clear.  We disagree.  The trial judge made the distinction between
    criminal negligence and dangerous driving.  The distinction is a subtle one and any difficulty in understanding it
    is perhaps a product <span class=GramE>of  that</span> subtle difference rather than
    anything the trial judge said.  In any
    event, we do not see how any possible error in relation to the instruction on
    criminal negligence could have made any difference.  This was an overwhelming case of criminal
    negligence causing bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to sentence, counsel for the appellant
    argues that the trial judge erred in failing to give any reasons for rejecting
    the submission that a conditional sentence should be imposed.  The trial judge’s reasons on sentence do
    indicate why he rejected that submission.  The trial judge said at p. 7 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A disposition short of actual custody would
    endanger the community and mock the principles of general and specific
    deterrence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree entirely with that sentiment.  Indeed, as a subsequent decision in this
    court, <i>R. v. Nusrat</i> (2009), 239
    C.C.C. (3d) 309, has made clear, convictions for offences of criminal
    negligence arising out of racing on public highways must be met with
    significant sentences.  As was indicated
    by my colleague in that case, at para. 69, “every street racer is a potential
    killer”.  We agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant in this case is lucky that he was not
    facing charges of criminal negligence causing death.  The manner in which he drove has caused
    serious injury to two victims.  It could easily
    have left nothing short of carnage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction and sentence is dismissed.</p>
