style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for
    fraud following a plea of guilty on the second day of trial.  The appellant submits that he did not receive
    effective assistance of counsel.  This
    incompetence, he argues, manifested itself early in the trial such that he
    found himself in a “no-win” situation.  He had no choice but to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The facts supporting the guilty plea can be
    briefly summarized as follows. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, posing as an employee of
    Barclay’s Bank, contacted a sales representative at Landmark Leasing for the
    purpose of leasing two vehicles for the company.  Negotiations took place electronically and
    resulted in the representative leaving two cars at a hotel for pick up.  When the representative became suspicious
    that Landmark Leasing had been defrauded, he arranged to lease a third
    vehicle.  The appellant was arrested when
    he arrived at the designated place to pick up this third car.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police investigated the area and seeing a
    car with a suspicious license plate, looked inside and found articles that implicated
    the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s argument of ineffective
    assistance of counsel is based on three aspects of the proceedings:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Failure to adduce evidence in the s. 8 <i>voir dire</i> involving the search of the
    car to establish the appellant’s reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Failure to review disclosure prior to trial or
    to seek an adjournment in order to be prepared to deal with the disclosure.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Failure to provide proper advice for the
    purposes of the guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal must fail as the appellant’s
    arguments do not meet the high threshold for establishing a claim of
    ineffective assistance of counsel that requires the appellant to establish
    first, the material facts upon which the incompetence is based; second, that
    the assistance counsel provided was ineffective on a test of reasonableness
    against a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct was reasonably competent;
    and third, that the ineffective assistance resulted in a miscarriage of
    justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Starting logically with the third test, the
    appellant faces the hurdle of overcoming his guilty plea.  Counsel for the appellant submits that trial
    counsel’s failure to adduce evidence in the <i>voir
    dire</i> to establish a privacy interest in the car and to respond properly to
    Crown disclosure put the appellant in a position early in the trial were he
    felt defeated.  The plea was therefore
    not voluntary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, the way in which it was taken and what
    the appellant said and did not say suggested that the plea was equivocal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the appellant’s argument fails on the
    prejudice aspect of the ineffective assistance of counsel test.  Even with evidence that the items in the car
    belonged to the appellant, it is highly unlikely that he would have been able
    to establish a privacy interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, there is nothing in the record to
    support a finding that counsel was not fully prepared when the trial was
    started.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, we are satisfied that even if a case
    could be made out in respect of the allegations of ineffective assistance of
    counsel, there was no miscarriage of justice.  In his signed guilty plea instructions, the appellant attested to the
    fact that he was pleading guilty voluntarily and free from coercion.  The plea was unequivocal at the time he made
    it.  A month later when he was sentenced,
    the appellant raised no issue about his plea.  In fact, he expressed remorse.  The mere fact that the appellant was not prepared to acknowledge his
    guilt in his written instructions does not, given what was said in court,
    impact on the unequivocal nature of his plea.  Moreover, to date there is not a hint of any defence beyond a bald
    assertion of innocence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No argument was made nor could one be made on
    this record that the appellant was not informed in respect of the nature of the
    allegations against him, the effect of his plea and the consequences of
    it.  What the record demonstrates is that
    the appellant, who is no stranger to the criminal justice system, entered a
    voluntary, unequivocal plea to the charge knowing full well the effect and
    consequences of that plea.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, we note that the case against the
    appellant was overwhelming.  In addition
    to his presence at the agreed-upon pick up location for the third car, the
    Crown relied on evidence including that of the appellant’s sister-in-law that
    the appellant let his family use one of the stolen cars that two witnesses
    identified the appellant’s voice as the person who negotiated the leases and
    that the e-mails in which the fake leases were negotiated were sent from a
    computer in the home where the appellant lived.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
