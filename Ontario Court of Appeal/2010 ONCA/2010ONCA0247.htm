  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pled guilty to a charge of possession of
    cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and was sentenced to 18 months
    imprisonment in addition to the 104 days she spent in pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same proceeding, the appellant’s <span
class=GramE>co-accused,</span> her then boyfriend who was living in her house,
    pled guilty to simple possession of cocaine and was sentenced to one day of
    imprisonment in addition to time served.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that she entered the guilty plea
    because her counsel did not provide her with effective representation and
    because the plea was not voluntary or informed.  She seeks an order setting aside the guilty plea and a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first issue, the appellant recognizes that she
    must establish on a balance of probabilities both that her trial counsel was
    incompetent and that the incompetent representation resulted in a miscarriage
    of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We find it unnecessary to deal with the first element
    because we conclude that she has failed to establish the second.  Had the appellant proceeded to a trial, it
    was likely that the copious evidence of drug trafficking at the house would
    have satisfied a trial judge that, at a minimum, she knew that drugs were being
    trafficked from the house over which she had control and she knowingly permitted
    those activities to go on.  Had she taken
    the stand and denied such knowledge and control, it is most likely that she
    would not have been believed given her numerous previous convictions, including
    several for crimes of dishonesty.  The
    appellant has failed to establish that if there was any incompetence it likely
    resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In regard to the second issue, the appellant carries
    the burden of persuading the court that her plea was not informed or voluntary.  She argues first that the plea was not
    informed because she entered the guilty plea without knowledge of the
    immigration consequences of that plea.  While counsel did not expressly advise her that her deportation would be
    automatic if convicted of possession for the purpose, he did tell her that upon
    conviction her deportation was unavoidable and that she would have no chance.  We would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.  The failure to specifically
    advise her that deportation would be automatic does not persuade us that the
    plea was not informed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She also argues that her plea was not voluntary because
    it was induced by threats from her co-accused.  Such threats must be established by credible evidence.  In our view, this allegation has not been
    made out.  Several facts weigh against
    her assertion:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All of the threats were made in a prison van en
    route to the court house, out of earshot of other people.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She did not report the threats that were
    allegedly made the morning of the trial to the police, the judge, her lawyer or
    anyone else at court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She has an extensive criminal record and has
    been convicted in the past for crimes of dishonesty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The joint submission that her plea was based on
    would have provided her with a favourable sentence in the circumstances.  Although the trial judge did not accept the
    joint submission, a possible consequence of which the appellant was aware, his
    failure to do so does not negate the voluntariness of her plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fact that the appellant entered a guilty
    plea is consistent with her past behaviour and is not a marked departure from
    it.  On the many occasions the appellant
    has appeared before the courts, she has always pleaded guilty and never contested
    any of her charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant filed her notice of appeal only
    after receiving the decision of the Immigration Appeal Division to discontinue
    the cancellation of the stay of the deportation order.  The decision to discontinue the stay was
    issued on February 10, 2009.  Her notice
    of appeal was filed February 23, 2009. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we agree with the Crown’s submission in its
    factum that private threats are easily claimed and difficult to disprove.  More was required than what was put forward
    in this case.  Otherwise, the integrity
    of the resolution process is far too easily undermined by an accused who
    regrets his or her choice to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
