  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves a question as to the jurisdiction
    of the Ontario Energy Board (the “Board”), namely, the extent of the Board’s
    exclusive jurisdiction to deal with legal and factual issues raised by a party
    claiming damages arising from the use of natural gas storage pools.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%'>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants are landowners in a rural area near the Township of
    Dawn-Euphemia.  Their lands form part of
    the Edys Mills Storage Pool, <span class=Prompt><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%;'>one
    of 19 natural gas storage pools operated by the respondent </span></span>Union Gas Ltd. (“Union”) as part of its
    integrated natural gas storage and transmission system.  Natural gas storage pools are naturally
    occurring geological formations suitable for the injection, storage and
    withdrawal of natural gas.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the
    1970s, the appellants (to be read in this judgment where necessary as including
    the appellants’ predecessors in title or interest) entered into petroleum and
    natural gas leases with Ram <span class=SpellE>Petroleums</span> Ltd. <span
class=FootnoteTextChar><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'> (“Ram”).  Those leases </span></span><span lang=EN-US>granted Ram the right to conduct drilling operations
    on the appellants’ properties in exchange for a monthly royalty payment on all
    oil produced</span>.  In October 1987, the appellants entered into
    Gas Storage Leases (the “GSLs”) with Ram, which ratified the earlier gas and
    petroleum leases and provided the appellants with a 10% profit share of all of
    Ram’s earnings from storage operations unless the leases were assigned to a
    third party.  The GSLs required the
    appellants’ consent before such an assignment could be made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    August 1989, the appellants agreed to Ram’s assignment of the GSLs to
    Union.  The appellants assert that they
    consented to the assignment on the understanding, based on representations made
    by Ram, that they would receive significant crude oil royalty payments from
    Union under the earlier leases. However, shortly after the assignment, Union
    ceased oil production and all royalty payments ceased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=Prompt><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%;'>In
    1992, the appellant Snopko entered into an Amending Agreement pursuant to which
    Union acquired the right to construct certain roadways on her property.  In the Amending Agreement, Snopko
    acknowledged receipt of compensation in respect of these roadways while also reserving
    the right to make a future claim in relation to wells installed by Union.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    November 30, 1992, the Lieutenant Governor in Council issued a regulation
    designating the Edys Mills Storage Pool as a designated gas storage area. On
    February 1, 1993, the Board issued a Designation Order under the predecessor
    legislation granting Union’s application for an order authorizing it to inject,
    store, and remove gas from the Edys Mills Storage Pool, and giving it
    permission to drill and construct the wells and other facilities necessary to
    connect the Edys Mills Storage Pool to Union’s integrated natural gas storage
    and transmission system. </span></p>

    1993 and 1999, Union paid the appellants compensation pursuant to the terms of
    their GSLs and, in the case of the appellant Snopko, pursuant to the 1992
    Amending Agreement.  Union also provided
    compensation to the appellants Lyle and Eldon Knight pursuant to a Roadway
    Agreement they had entered into, which provided for certain annual roadway
    payments.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Lambton County Storage Association (the “LCSA”), of which the appellants were
    members at the relevant time, is a volunteer association representing
    approximately 160 landowners who own property within Union’s storage
    system.  In 2000, the LCSA brought
    an application before the Board seeking “fair and equitable compensation” from
    Union pursuant to s. 38(3) of the <i>Ontario
    Energy Board Act, 1998, </i>S.O. 1998, c. 15, Sched. B (the “Act”), which
    requires a party authorized to use a designated gas storage area to make “just
    and equitable compensation” for the right to store gas or for any damage
    resulting from the authority to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Union argued that, in the light of the terms of their
    leases, the appellants had no standing to apply for compensation.  In a Decision and Order dated September 10,
    2003, the Board found that Snopko’s standing was limited to issues not dealt
    with in the GSLs and that the appellant McMurphy had no standing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the remaining issues were decided on the merits
    by the Board, the LCSA and Union settled on the question of just and equitable
    compensation for all claims arising between 1999-2008 that were or could have
    been raised at the hearing.  On March 23,
    2004, the Board approved this settlement by way of a Compensation Order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent with the terms of an undertaking given by
    Union to the Board, Union extended to all LCSA members who did not receive full
    standing an offer to be compensated on the same terms enshrined in the
    Compensation Order.  Each of the
    appellants accepted.<span style='line-height:200%;
'> <span class=Prompt><span lang=EN-US>The agreements

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 29, 2008, the appellants commenced this

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge granted Union’s motion for summary
    judgment <span class=GramE>and  dismissed</span> the claim on jurisdictional grounds.  The
    motion judge followed the decision of Pennell J. in <i>Re Wellington and Imperial Oil Ltd.</i>, [1970] 1 O.R. 177 (H.C.J.), at
    pp. 183-84:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n many cases where a dispute arises as to
    the amount of compensation, the first thing a board of arbitration has to do is
    to inquire what were the subsisting rights at the time the right to
    compensation arose; and that in some cases such inquiry would necessarily
    involve the interpretation of agreements in which the subsisting rights were
    embodied.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is with reluctance that I conclude that the Legislature has taken
    away the <i>prima facie</i> right of a party
    to have a dispute determined by declaration of the Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that s. 38 conferred
    exclusive <span class=GramE>jurisdiction</span> on the Board to decide all
    issues pertaining to compensation from the operation of the gas storage
    operation and that the appellants’ claims fell within that exclusive
    jurisdiction. Accordingly, he dismissed the appellants’ action.   </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While Union submits that the appellants’ claims should
    be dismissed on several grounds, the central issue on this appeal is whether
    the motion judge erred in concluding that the Superior Court has no
    jurisdiction to entertain those claims against Union.</p>

    broad jurisdiction to regulate the storage of natural gas, to designate an area
    as a gas storage area, to authorize the injection of gas into that area, and to
    order the person so authorized to pay just and equitable compensation to the
    owners of the property overlaying the storage area.  Moreover, s. 38(3) provides that no civil
    proceeding may be commenced in order to determine that compensation.</span></span><u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants concede that if their claim arose simply
    from an inability to agree with Union on the <i>amount</i> of compensation, s. 38(3) of the Act grants the Board
    exclusive jurisdiction.  They submit,
    however, that as their claim attacks the validity of agreements relied upon by
    Union and <span class=GramE>alleges</span> breach of contract, negligence,
    unjust enrichment and nuisance, it falls outside the ambit of s. 38 or, at the
    very least, there is a <span class=SpellE>triable</span> issue as to
    jurisdiction that should not have been decided on a motion for summary
    judgment. <u></u></p>

    submission that the legal characterization of their claims <span lang=EN-US>determines the issue of the Board’s
    jurisdiction. It is the substance not the legal form of the claim that should
    determine the issue of jurisdiction. If the substance of the claim falls within

    chooses to describe it. </span><span class=Prompt><span lang=EN-US

    Pennell J. stated in <i>Re Wellington and
    Imperial Oil Ltd.</i>, at p. 183, “whatever may be the form of the issue

    claims <span class=GramE>advanced  by</span> the appellants in the statement of claim all arise from Union’s operation of
    the Edys Mills Storage Pool. The claim for breach of contract asserts that
    Union has failed to compensate the appellants for crop loss and other lost
    income arising from Union’s storage operations. The claim for unjust enrichment
    asserts that Union “is enriched by storing gas on and in the Plaintiffs’ land
    and is enriched by having oil located in the Plaintiffs’ land left in place.”
    The nuisance claim asserts that “Union’s gas storage operation unreasonably
    interferes with [the Plaintiffs’] enjoyment of their land.” The negligence
    claim asserts that Union “was negligent in their gas storage operations”,
    thereby causing harm to the appellants. Finally, the appellants alleged that
    Union has been storing gas without a contract.</span></span></p>

    response to the court’s invitation to make written submissions on the
    jurisdictional issue, counsel for the Board advised us that the jurisprudence
    of the Board supports an expansive interpretation of its jurisdiction under its
    enabling statute, which would include the ability to determine the validity of
    compensation contracts. In <i>The Matter of
    certain applications to the Ontario Energy Board in respect of the Bentpath
    Pool</i> (1982), E.B.O. 64(1) &amp; (2), the Board held, at p. 33, that it
    “does have the power, as part of its broader administrative function, to
    determine the validity of contracts” for the purpose of determining the
    appropriate compensation to be paid to a landowner under what is now s. 38 of
    the Act. I agree with the respondent that <i>Bentpath</i> and <i>Re Wellington and Imperial Oil Ltd.</i> supersede the Board’s earlier decision in <i>The
    Matter of an Application by Union Gas Company of Canada and Ontario Natural Gas
    Storage to inject gas into, store gas in and remove gas from the designated gas
    storage area known as Dawn #156 Pool</i> (1962), E.B.O. 1.</span></span></p>

    is empowered to decide. I agree with Union’s submission that, to endorse the
    appellants’ position by holding that the Board’s jurisdiction could be avoided
