    hospital, but that on a later date, when the radiology report became available,
    he breached the standard of care in not advising Mr. Frazer of his talus
    fracture.  The damages that flowed from
    the failure to advise Mr. Frazer of his talus fracture until the point that he
    became aware of it were assessed by the trial judge at $2,500.  </span></p>

Further, the trial judge awarded $50,000 for Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chap. F.3 damages to Jennifer Smith.

    loss of income or, in the further alternative, he seeks a new trial. He also

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span class=Prompt><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Grant Frazer was in a motorcycle accident on November 25,
    2001.  He was taken to the emergency room
    at Northumberland Hospital where Dr. Haukioja was the attending physician.  Dr. Haukioja was a charismatic, humorous and
    confident man.  He joked around and spoke
    to Mr. Frazer about motorcycles as he performed his duties.  X-rays and a CT scan were performed.  Among Mr. Frazer’s other injuries, Dr.
    Haukioja diagnosed a left-ankle fracture and a right-ankle soft tissue
    injury.  A cast was placed on the left
    ankle only.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Frazer was admitted for observation.  When he complained of continuing pain in his
    right ankle, Dr. Haukioja advised that the pain was a necessary part of
    recovery and that he had to work through it.  Mr. Frazer was discharged by another doctor on December 2, 2001 with a
    follow-up appointment with Dr. Haukioja scheduled for January 10, 2002.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It was not until December 6, 2001 that the radiologist, Dr.
    Marrocco, examined Mr. Frazer’s x-rays.  He immediately noticed a talar fracture in Mr. Frazer’s right
    ankle.  Dr. Marrocco duly prepared and
    faxed a report to Dr. Haukioja.  He met
    with Dr. Haukioja at Northumberland Hospital later that day to discuss the
    fracture.  The two men examined the x-ray
    image together.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Haukioja made no effort to communicate with Mr. Frazer
    until the follow-up appointment on January 10, 2002.  Although Dr. Haukioja advised Mr. Frazer on
    that day that he had missed a right-ankle fracture, he characterized the
    fracture as tiny, barely visible and not requiring treatment.  He suggested that the continuing pain was
    attributable to soft-tissue damage.  He
    reiterated that Mr. Frazer had to work through the pain in order to recover,
    and further advised that Mr. Frazer could stop using crutches and return to
    work.   Dr. Haukioja then ordered another
    set of x-rays.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In accordance with Dr. Haukioja’s advice, Mr. Frazer returned
    to work on January 14, 2002.  He found
    the physical demands of working to be exhausting.  On January 15, 2002, he experienced four
    separate attacks of severe pain in his right ankle.  He described them as “dental shocks” because
    the pain was similar to what one would experience when a cavity is drilled
    without anaesthetic.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As a result of the pain Mr. Frazer attended at a walk-in
    clinic at the end of the day on January 16, 2002.  He was seen by Dr. Woodward, who undertook to
    review his hospital chart.   Dr. Woodward
    subsequently advised that Mr. Frazer had a “major fracture” in his right ankle
    that might require surgical intervention.  He referred Mr. Frazer to Dr. Blastorah, an orthopaedic surgeon.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On January 23, 2002, Mr. Frazer met with Dr. Blastorah.  It was at this meeting that Mr. Frazer was
    first apprised of the seriousness of his injury and the potential
    complications.  He learned that the
    complications that could arise included arthritis, avascular necrosis (death of
    the bone as a result of an interruption of the blood supply) and the
    possibility that he might need surgery to fuse a joint in his ankle.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>When Mr. Frazer realized the full extent of his injuries, he
    became focused on the fact that Dr. Haukioja had lied to him.  This led to Mr. Frazer being “hyper alert”
    and “hyper aware” as to why he was not called by Dr. Haukioja, why he was
    permitted to walk on a fractured ankle, and why he was allowed to injure
    himself.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Frazer saw a psychiatrist, Dr. Joel Sadavoy.  Dr. Sadavoy saw him three times between
    December 13, 2005 and January 5, 2006, and once in October, 2007 and concluded
    that Mr. Frazer suffers from an anxiety disorder with features of panic
    disorder and presents with elements of depressive, emotional states that are
    intermittent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that the psychiatric diagnosis of Mr.
    Frazer was totally as a result of Dr. Haukioja’s failure to properly treat his
    patient.  </span></p>

    Reznek for Dr. Haukioja.  The trial judge
    preferred Dr. Sadavoy’s evidence.  Dr.
    Neal’s independence and impartiality were called into question by the nature of
    his communications with counsel, his methodology, and his demeanour in the
    witness box.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge rejected Dr. Reznek’s opinion because he was
    “[c]herry picking facts that support a diagnosis that just happens to support
    the cause of the client... and failing to include the facts that hurt the
    cause, whether those latter facts are capable of explanation and elimination in
    the course of the development of the expert’s analysis and opinion or not”.  </span></p>

    surgeon.  The trial judge found that
    while most of his evidence was helpful, his testimony regarding potential
    displacement in the sub-talar joint was not balanced and fair.  He preferred the opinions of Dr. Haukioja’s
    witnesses, Dr. Rubenstein and Dr. Sanders.</span></p>

    interpretation of Mr. Frazer’s November 25, 2001 right-ankle x-ray did not
    breach the standard of care.  His reasons
    included:  [T]hat Dr. Rubenstein
    testified that the quality of the image was “sub-optimal” and that talar
    fractures are an uncommon injury.  Indeed, he noted that Dr. Haukioja had never before diagnosed such an
    injury.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Frazer was discharged from the hospital on December 2,
    2001, although the radiology report for the right-ankle x-ray was missing from
    his chart.  Nevertheless, the trial judge
    found that Dr. Haukioja did not authorize the discharge and therefore was not
    liable for failing to notice that the report was missing.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>However, the trial judge did find that Dr. Haukioja breached
    the standard of care by failing to take active steps following December 6, 2001
    to advise Mr. Frazer of the right-ankle fracture.   Further, he found that Dr. Haukioja’s breach
    extended past the follow-up appointment on January 10, 2002, in which Dr.
    Haukioja continued to misrepresent the extent of the injury.  And finally, the trial judge found that Dr.
    Haukioja missed yet another opportunity to fulfil his duties when the January
    10, 2002 x-rays confirmed the existence and severity of the fracture — all of
    which I refer to collectively as “the non-disclosure”. </span></p>

    or remoteness issue, much of the confusion would vanish. ... Although one
    cannot totally and completely divorce the two issues, it can be said that
    cause-in-fact is fundamentally a question of fact, which can be treated
    relatively expeditiously in most tort litigation.  Proximate cause or remoteness, on the other
    hand, cannot be handled so simply, because it deals with the limits of liability
    for negligent conduct, which...demands delicate value judgments and the drawing
    of fine lines.  It is more a question of

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Factual causation can be established in two ways: the “but
    for” test and the “material contribution” test.  Only one of these tests will apply in any given case.  The differences between the two tests was
    recently clarified in <i>Resurfice Corp. v.
    Hanke</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 333 at paras. 21-25:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, the
    basic test for determining causation remains the &quot;but for&quot; test.  This applies to multi-cause injuries.  The plaintiff bears the burden of showing
    that &quot;but for&quot; the negligent act or omission of each defendant, the
    injury would not have occurred.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, in
    special circumstances, the law has recognized exceptions to the basic &quot;but
    for&quot; test, and applied a &quot;material contribution&quot; test.  Broadly speaking, the cases in which the
    &quot;material contribution&quot; test is properly applied involve two
    requirements.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, it
    must be impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's negligence
    caused the plaintiff's injury using the &quot;but for&quot; test.  The impossibility must be due to factors that
    are outside of the plaintiff's control; for example, current limits of
    scientific knowledge.  Second, it must be
    clear that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff, thereby
    exposing the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of injury, and the plaintiff
    must have suffered that form of injury.  In other words, the plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the
    risk created by the defendant's breach.  In those exceptional cases where these two requirements are satisfied,
    liability may be imposed, even though the &quot;but for&quot; test is not
    satisfied, because it would offend basic notions of fairness and justice to
    deny liability by applying a &quot;but for&quot; approach.</p>

    submission that the trial judge erred in applying the material contribution
    test after he successfully reasoned his way through the “but for” test.  The two requirements set out above in <span
class=SpellE><i>Resurfice</i></span><i> </i>for application of the material
    contribution test are not met in this case.  Specifically, the difficulty of proving causation in cases of
    psychiatric harm does not always amount to impossibility.  However, as I will explain, I am of the view
    that factual causation is made out on the &quot;but for&quot; test. </p>

    that the non-disclosure was a &quot;but for&quot; cause of Mr. Frazer’s
    psychiatric injury.  In his factum he
    argues that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Sadavoy never said Dr. Haukioja’s conduct
    contributed to or caused the respondent’s psychiatric illness.  He said that the respondent’s belief that he
    had been malevolently treated by Dr. Haukioja contributed to his illness,
    together with other factors, like his realization that he would never heal
    properly.  There was no evidence to show
    that Dr. Haukioja’s failure to appropriately treat the talus fracture caused
    [Mr. Frazer’s] psychiatric illness.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge perceived it, the evidence of Dr.
    Sadavoy is vital in determining whether the &quot;but for&quot; test has been

  <p><span

    difference between the true severity of the talus fracture and Dr. Haukioja’s
    representations.  Dr. Haukioja failed to
    communicate with Mr. Frazer at all between December 6, 2001 and January 10,
    2002, leaving Mr. Frazer with the understanding that there was no right-ankle
    fracture.  On January 10, 2002, Dr.
    Haukioja communicated in an inadequate fashion, leaving Mr. Frazer with the
    understanding that the fracture was tiny, barely visible and minor.  It was not until January 23, 2002 that
    another doctor advised Mr. Frazer of the true nature of his injury.   </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The second cause named by Dr. Sadavoy is Mr. Frazer’s belief
    that he was medically mistreated and deliberately harmed.  Dr. Haukioja argues that there is a legal
    distinction between the non-disclosure and Mr. Frazer's interpretation of the non-disclosure.  Moreover, as the trial judge found there was
    no evidence to support a finding that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Haukioja</span> deliberately exposed Mr. Frazer to harm, it was not open to the trial judge to
    find factual causation.  I do not agree
    with this submission.  Despite the trial
    judge’s finding that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Haukioja</span> did not act
    deliberately, it is sufficient that Mr. Frazer would not have formed the belief
    that Dr. Haukioja was deliberately causing him harm if the non-disclosure had
    never happened.  This is all that the
    &quot;but for&quot; test requires.   </span></p>

    belief that he contributed to his own disability by walking on the ankle.  Mr. Frazer would not have experienced extra
    pain from weight-bearing, and thus formed the belief that he had exacerbated
    his injury, if Dr. Haukioja had disclosed the existence of the fracture on
    December 6, 2001.  This is sufficient to

    principle that the harm suffered must be of a kind, type or class that was
    reasonably foreseeable as a result of the defendant's negligence.  This reasonable foreseeability test stems
    from <i>Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v.
    Mort’s Dock and Engineering Co.</i> (<i>The
    Wagon Mound (No. 1)</i>), [1961] A.C. 388 (P.C) at 422-23.  This was expanded in <i>Hughes v. Lord Advocate</i>, [1963] A.C. 837 (H.L.), and adopted by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Ontario
    (Ministry of Highways) v. Coté</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 595, where Dickson J.
    explained that “<span style='color:black'>[i]t is not necessary that one
    foresee the &quot;precise concatenation of events&quot;; it is enough to fix
    liability if one can foresee in a general way the class or character of injury
    which occurred”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although psychiatric damages traditionally
    engendered more controversy than physical ones, this same foreseeability
    framework has come to be applied.  Canadian law has adopted the following statement from <i>White v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
    Police</i>, [1998] 3 W.L.R. 1509 (H.L.) at p. 1512: “The law expects reasonable
    fortitude and robustness of its citizens and will not impose liability for the
    exceptional frailty of certain individuals.”<span style='line-height:200%'>  Thus, in <i>Mustapha</i>, the Supreme Court found at
    para. 16 that in order to establish a claim for psychiatric damages, a plaintiff
    must show that a person of reasonable fortitude would have suffered a mental
    injury.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    cited above,<span style='line-height:200%'> to the need

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Once the foreseeability of psychiatric damage in a person of
    reasonable fortitude is established, “the defendant must take the plaintiff as
    it finds him for purposes of damages” (<i>Mustapha, </i>para. 16).   Thus, in the present case, it was not
    necessary that the </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span class=GramE>respondent</span> prove that it was
    reasonably foreseeable that a person of normal fortitude would have suffered
    anxiety disorder, depression and agoraphobia.  Rather, once it was established that it was reasonably foreseeable that a
    person of reasonable fortitude would suffer some compensable mental <span

    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Haukioja relies heavily on the recent decision of <i>Mustapha</i>.  The trial judge stated in his reasons that he
    distinguished <i>Mustapha </i>on the basis
    that Grant Frazer suffered an underlying physical injury.  Although the trial judge claims to
    distinguish <i>Mustpha </i>I do not read the
    balance of his reasons as “distinguishing”<i> </i>that case in the sense of refusing to apply the test it establishes.  Rather, the framework set out in <i>Mustapha</i></span><i> </i>led the trial judge to find that the legal causation test was met
    in this case, although it was not in <i>Mustapha</i><span
style='line-height:200%'>.  I take this conclusion as stemming primarily from
    two differences in the facts of this case.  First, unlike <i>Mustapha</i>, there
    is no evidence in this case that Mr. Frazer is anything but a person of
    ordinary mental fortitude.   Second, the
    nature of the breach, when viewed in light of the relationship between Grant
    Frazer and Dr. <span class=SpellE>Haukioja</span> renders psychiatric injury
    foreseeable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>In <i>Mustapha</i>, there were clear
    factual findings that the plaintiff's reaction was abnormal and a product of
    his particular hypersensitivity.  All of
    the medical evidence characterized Mr. Mustapha's reaction as unusual, strange
    and highly individualized.  The lay
    witnesses were all agreed that he had an &quot;unusually high concern over the
    health and well being of his family&quot; and over the cleanliness of his home.  This evidence was not refuted by the
    plaintiff.  Indeed, in concluding that it
    was not reasonably foreseeable that a person of reasonable fortitude would
    suffer a mental injury from seeing a fly in a bottle of water, the Supreme
    Court notes that not even the plaintiff’s expert witness had testified that it
    was:  para. 18. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no evidence that Mr. Frazer’s injuries
    were the result of a similar hypersensitivity.  To the contrary, in our case, all the evidence suggests that Grant
    Frazer had no particular sensitivities, emotional or otherwise.  He was highly educated, employed in the
    vocation of his choosing, financially stable, and physically active.  He had a normal social life and was in a
    long-standing romantic relationship.  The
    trial judge rejected - correctly in my view - the proposition put forward by
    Dr. Reznek that Mr. Frazer was an emotionally vulnerable person because his
    brother had committed suicide and his mother had at one point been diagnosed
    with cancer.   Personal tragedy clearly
    does not equate with hypersensitivity as that term was used in <i>Duwyn</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, in <i>Mustapha</i>,
    the relationship was of a contractual, commercial nature.  In this case, the relationship was between a
    professional and a client; Dr. Haukioja was in a position of trust and
    authority relative to Mr. Frazer.  The
    nature of this relationship is, in my view, such that it should have fallen
    within Dr. Haukioja's contemplation that a breach of that trust as blatant as
    the one that occurred in this case could have severe ramifications for his
    patient's mental health.<a href="#_ftn3"

    his reasons that, “[t]he psychiatric evidence establishes that the illness that
    Dr. Haukioja’s conduct brought about in Grant was foreseeable even if the
    extent of his disability was not.”  I
    read this as the trial judge’s following the test in </span><i>Mustapha</i> and finding that it was
    reasonably foreseeable that Dr. Haukioja’s conduct would cause a mental injury
    in a person of reasonable fortitude, even if the precise nature and extent of
    Mr. Frazer’s condition were not reasonably foreseeable.  Thus, although the trial judge distinguished <i>Mustapha</i> on its facts, he actually applied
    the test established in that case, and did so correctly.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mere &quot;general emotional upset&quot; and
    compensable psychological injury fall along a spectrum that is difficult to
    navigate with any degree of precision: see <i>Mustapha</i>,
    paras. 8-9<span class=GramE>.  The</span> former is unquestionably foreseeable in this case.  However, it seems to me that it was also foreseeable
    that Dr. Haukioja's non-disclosure could give rise to a recognized psychiatric
    illness.  Dr. Haukioja was an experienced
    doctor and Grant Frazer was his patient.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    still being discussed, the correlation between pain and anxiety cannot be said
    to be a revolutionary concept.  I would
    also observe that if one were to consider this case against <i><span style='color:black'>Wagon Mound No. 2</span></i><span
style='color:black'>, [1966] 2 All E.R. 709 (P.C.) per Lord Reid</span>, the
    cost of avoiding the damage was minimal relative to the probability of serious
    psychiatric damage.  All Dr. Haukioja had
    to do was make a phone call to Mr. Frazer within a reasonable time after
    December 6, 2001.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would therefore dismiss these grounds of appeal.  The trial judge analyzed and assessed the
    emotional and psychiatric effect of Dr. Haukioja’s conduct on Mr. Frazer at the
    time that the nature of his professional failures became clear to Mr. Frazer - when
    he learned of the extent of his physical injuries, including the range of
    possible outcomes.  The trial judge’s
    findings were fully supported by the evidence and correct in law.  In rendering his decision, he committed no
    palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law.  There is no reason, in my opinion, to
    interfere with his decision.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 3: Did the trial judge
    err in respect of damages?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Haukioja argues that if he is unsuccessful on the
    first two issues, the damages awarded by the trial judge should be
    reduced.  He advances two main omissions by
    the trial judge that he says amount to errors and argues that the amount awarded
    to Mr. Frazer for lost income ought to be reduced to account for these errors.  First, he says that the trial judge failed to
    consider that the orthopaedic injuries suffered by Mr. Frazer as a result of
    his accident would themselves have resulted in him losing both past and future
    income, apart from the psychiatric injuries caused by Dr. Haukioja’s negligence.  Second, he says that the trial judge failed
    to make adequate deductions for other specific contingencies in respect of Mr.
    Frazer’s future loss of income and past lost income.  I reject both of these submissions.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Consideration of accident caused injuries</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding past loss of income, the trial judge held
    that the evidence did not establish that complications from the injuries
    arising from the accident would have disabled Mr. Frazer and prevented him from
    working from the time he returned to work on January 14, 2002, up to the time
    of trial.  However, he noted that Mr.
    Frazer’s past income loss calculation understated his income loss to trial by
    about 10 months.  The trial judge
    concluded “the missing months adequately compensate for any negative
    contingency the court otherwise might apply to reduce the past income loss
    award.”  And as to the future loss, at
    para. 271 of his reasons, the trial judge held that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From an orthopedic standpoint, neither the
    individual nor combined physical injuries that Grant suffered in the motor
    cycle accident of 25 November 2001 are disabling.  But for the psychiatric disorder that
    followed upon the accident and Grant’s medical management by Dr. Haukioja,
    Grant would have been capable of returning to his pre-accident employment as a
    teacher at least by September 2002 and he would have continued to earn the
    income enjoyed by teachers in his pay grid (A4) …</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is clear that the trial judge concluded that
    the evidence was not sufficient to justify adjusting for the contingency that Mr.
    Frazer’s accident related injuries would have disabled him from working as a
    teacher in the future.  While it was
    certainly possible that he could have on-going problems, the serious orthopedic
    consequences had all disappeared at the time of trial.  Possible future complications in this regard did
    not mean he would be unable to work at his job as an elementary school teacher.</p>
