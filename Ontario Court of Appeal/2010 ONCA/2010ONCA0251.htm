  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the final order of <span
class=SpellE>Magda</span> J. dismissing the appellant’s motion to change a
    final order of Lack J. made on consent.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal <span class=SpellE>Magda</span> J.’s costs award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The consent order provided that Joshua, the second eldest
    child, was to be in the custody of and reside with the respondent while the
    other three children were to be in the custody of and reside with the
    appellant.  It also provided that the
    appellant would pay the respondent $3,000 a month in spousal support and that “[t]here
    shall be no termination date for spousal support” and “[e]<span class=SpellE>ither</span> party may ask for review of the quantum of support upon a material change in
    circumstances.”  The consent order was
    made on February 21, 2008.  On July 1,
    2008, Joshua went to live with his father.  At the time of the move, the parties agreed that the father would no
    longer pay child support for Joshua. The move and the father’s allegedly
    deteriorating financial position are said to constitute a material change in
    circumstances in relation to the spousal support order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant tendered fresh evidence but failed to
    persuade us that it was admissible.  As
    the fresh evidence deals with developments that occurred subsequent to the
    trial judge’s decision, in this case it is not helpful in determining if the
    trial judge committed a reversible error.  The tendered “fresh” evidence here is aptly described as “new” evidence
    that would more appropriately form the subject of another motion to vary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant attempted to argue that the trial judge
    erred in not setting a termination date for spousal support and in not imputing
    income to the respondent.  We do not
    understand how these issues can be said to form the basis of an alleged change
    of circumstances.  They were issues that are
    foreclosed by the consent order made only eight months earlier.  The trial judge did not err in finding that
    the consent <span class=GramE>order</span> provided that only the quantum but
    not the duration of spousal support could be subject to variation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argued that spousal support should be
    reduced because of Joshua’s move and the appellant’s deteriorating financial
    position.  The trial judge did not accept
    that there was any deterioration and observed that the appellant’s income had actually
    increased from what was used as the basis of the consent order.  As well, he noted the appellant would no
    longer have to pay $1,297 a month in child support for Joshua.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue boils down to whether the trial judge erred
    by concluding that Joshua’s move from the mother’s to the father’s residence
    was reasonably foreseeable and therefore not a material change in the
    circumstances of this case.  The
    appellant argues that this finding was not open to the trial judge as the
    mother testified that she did not anticipate Joshua’s move.  We disagree.  Joshua had changed residences before and the trial judge had an ample
    basis to conclude that in the circumstances of this case another move was
    foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal the
    trial judge’s costs order.  Costs are
    discretionary and we were not persuaded this is a case where leave should be
    granted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the appeal are fixed in the amount of $6,000
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
