  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of discharging a firearm
    with intent to wound and various gun related offences. He received a global
    sentence of 7 years, less 55 months for time spent in pre-trial custody. He appeals
    from both conviction and sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to conviction, the appellant raises two
    grounds of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in denying his application to stay the proceedings under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. We would not give effect to
    this ground. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged on May 21, 2006 and his trial
    in the Superior Court commenced on September 2, 2008. As the record indicates,
    over the course of this 27-month period, the Crown did not cause any delay.
    Indeed, the Crown did what it could at every step along the way to move the
    process along. As part of this, early dates were offered to the appellant at
    both the preliminary hearing stage in the Ontario Court of Justice and at the
    trial stage in the Superior Court. For example, in the Ontario Court of
    Justice, dates for the preliminary hearing (which was projected to last 3 days)
    were offered as early as August 2006, within a few months of the charges. The
    appellant was unable to <span class=GramE>proceed</span> that quickly and 3
    days in December 2006 were set aside. Those dates had to be scrapped when the
    appellant changed counsel. Ultimately, the preliminary hearing was conducted
    over a 3-day period in October 2007. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Efforts were also made in the Superior Court to
    accommodate the appellant. The appellant appeared in the Superior Court on
    November 5, 2007. His counsel was not available for trial until after February
    25, 2008. It was estimated that the trial would last at least two weeks and the
    court could not accommodate everyone’s schedules until mid-September 2008. Given
    that the appellant was in custody, the matter was adjourned until January 7,
    2008, with a view to narrowing the issues and seeing if an earlier date could
    be found. On January 7, a two-week block of time in April 2008 was offered to
    the appellant. Unfortunately, that did not accord with his counsel’s schedule.
    In the end, the matter was adjourned to the first week of September 2008 for
    trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the record shows, the system was prepared to
    accommodate the appellant throughout and had he availed himself of the various
    opportunities, or even some of them, his trial would have occurred much
    earlier. That did not occur because initially the appellant had difficulties
    retaining counsel of choice and latterly, because his counsel of choice could not
    take up the April dates offered in the Superior Court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No one is faulting the appellant for his choices. But
    this is not a case where the system or the Crown failed him. While it is true
    that the appellant was in custody throughout, and while we do not minimize the
    prejudice associated with his loss of liberty, it cannot be ignored that during
    the entire process, the appellant chose not to have a bail hearing. Whatever <span
class=GramE>reasons he may have had for this, surely that is</span> not something
    for which the Crown should be held responsible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, balancing the prejudice to the appellant
    against the serious nature of the charges and society’s interest in having a
    trial on the merits, we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred. Indeed,
    we are satisfied that he came to the correct decision. Accordingly, this ground
    fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second ground of appeal against
    conviction is that the trial judge misapprehended key portions of the evidence
    and reversed the onus of proof. We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge engaged in permissible deductive
    reasoning in rejecting the appellant’s version of events. In doing so, he did
    not misapprehend the appellant’s evidence as to the circumstances under which
    he claims the gun was fired. On the contrary, he considered the appellant’s
    evidence and concluded that it was fanciful to infer that the victim either
    shot himself or was shot by a second assailant who was holding the victim in a
    bear hug at the time. The trial judge also gave cogent reasons for accepting
    the evidence of the victim and the second assailant, both of whom testified that
    the appellant was the shooter. Accordingly, we would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for sentence, we are not persuaded that the trial
    judge erred in the application of the <i>Kienapple</i> principle. Regardless, the sentence was fit and not one which we would disturb
    in any event. The appeal from sentence is likewise dismissed.</p>
