  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges the trial judge’s decision in
    her action for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against her former
    solicitor, Mr. Parlee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the midst of the 2005 matrimonial trial, and with
    the advice of Mr. Parlee, the appellant entered into minutes of settlement with
    her former husband.  Within a few months,
    the appellant sued Mr. Parlee alleging that he was negligent and had breached
    his fiduciary duty in his conduct of the matrimonial action and in the advice
    he gave the appellant at the time of the settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the 2008 trial, Mr. Parlee admitted negligence in
    two respects.  First, he admitted that he
    failed to identify that the husband’s cottage property was a matrimonial home
    subject to equalization at the date of separation.  Second, he failed to advise the appellant
    about the proper range of spousal support to which she was entitled after her
    24-year marriage.  The trial judge
    rejected the numerous other claims of negligence that the appellant alleged
    against Mr. Parlee.  In the result, the
    trial judge awarded the appellant damages regarding the cottage and spousal
    support negligence, totalling $69,684, plus prejudgment interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As she did at trial, the appellant argues on appeal
    that the lawyer’s negligence went far beyond the cottage and spousal
    support.  She alleges that the negligence
    permeated every aspect of her settlement with her former husband and that, as a
    result, every item that might have been included on a net family property
    statement should be reconsidered and the equalization payment calculated
    anew.  However, we agree with the trial
    judge that the lawyer’s negligence and consequent damages are limited to the
    two particular areas of admitted negligence and did not permeate the whole of
    the settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge could have canvassed the factual basis
    for his rejection of the appellant’s other grounds of alleged negligence in
    more detail.  However, he concluded that
    the appellant’s other attacks on the overall global settlement of $280,000 were
    simply attempts to re-examine or fine tune the settlement using hindsight.  He did so after noting the appellant’s
    difficulties with her claim for constructive trust against the cottage and with
    the value that she placed on the matrimonial home, which would have been
    adversely affected by the recent discovery that it was insulated with toxic
    material.  In our view, the trial judge’s
    reasons are adequate for their purpose and do not raise a reviewable error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also rejected the wife’s claim for
    section 7 expenses.  He did so on the
    basis that the claim was not substantiated by the evidence and that, in any
    event, it was resolved by the parties when the wife withdrew her claim in
    exchange for the husband agreeing to be responsible for half of the increased
    line of credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was also alert to the disposition of
    costs and prejudgment interest in the minutes of settlement.  He took into account evidence of the
    husband’s intransigence on this issue as well as the improbability of the
    appellant achieving success at trial in obtaining this relief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the trial judge’s rejection of these
    other grounds of negligence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before us, the appellant did not pursue her submission
    that the trial judge was biased in favour of the respondent.  Accordingly, nothing more needs to be said in
    relation to this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn to the remaining issue, which was the amount of
    damages ordered for the negligence in regard to spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s determination of the damages related to
    spousal support was limited to a relatively narrow period of time.  This was because the impugned minutes of
    settlement had provided for a review of spousal support in 2007.  When the appellant sued Mr. Parlee, Mr.
    Parlee issued a third-party claim against the former husband.  The parties then settled the issue of spousal
    support from July 2007 onwards, although only the fact and not the terms of
    that settlement were disclosed to the trial judge.  In the result, the damages arising from Mr.
    Parlee’s negligence on the question of spousal support were restricted to the
    period from the date of the parties’ separation until the 2007 review date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the parties had separated in 2001, the wife
    continued to reside in the matrimonial home until the summer of 2003, initially
    on a full-time basis and latterly on a part-time basis.  At the eventual February 2004 hearing of the
    wife’s claim for interim spousal support, the motion judge concluded that the
    wife earned approximately $34,000 annually and the husband earned an annual
    average income of $75,000.  On this
    basis, he awarded the appellant interim support of $700 per month.  That amount was carried forward into the
    minutes of settlement as ongoing support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that, had Mr. Parlee advised
    the appellant about the proper amount of <i>Guidelines</i> spousal support, she would have been awarded support of $1,500 monthly.  We see no error in the damages award based on
    this amount of monthly spousal support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also see no error in the trial judge’s refusal to
    give the appellant a separate damages award for her claimed post-separation
    educational costs, which he would have taken into account in his disposition of
    her claim regarding spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s
    notional start date of February 2004.  She argues that the proper commencement date should have been the summer
    of 2003 when she initially moved out of the matrimonial home, or September 2003
    when the claim was advanced for interim child support, or November 2003 when
    she commenced her motion for spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge listed five circumstances in denying
    the appellant damages for lost spousal support based on a commencement date earlier
    than February 2004.  The first factor,
    that the appellant was earning $34,000 annually, was not relevant, particularly
    in light of the evidence that the husband’s average income was $75,000.  The second and fourth factors related to the
    parties’ living arrangements until the summer of 2003.  However, those arrangements do not explain
    why spousal support should not begin after the appellant fully moved out of the
    home.  The third and fifth factors relate
    to the wife’s increase of the parties’ line of credit by $39,000 around the
    time of separation.  However, this increase
    in debt load could not be relevant to the issue of the retrospectivity of
    spousal support in light of the fact that responsibility for the increased debt
    was adjusted by the parties in satisfaction of the wife’s claim for section 7
    expenses.  Counsel for the respondent
    acknowledges that the trial judge’s reasons appear to “double account” for the
    increased line of credit.  The $39,000 line
    of credit was irrelevant to the start date of spousal support.  Accordingly, in our view, the trial judge
    erred in restricting the commencement date of spousal support to February,
    2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting date for child support, which was not
    challenged on appeal, was September 4, 2003.  In our view, the circumstances at that time, as well as the fact that
    the appellant could reasonably have made a claim for spousal support retrospective
    to that date, make September 4, 2003 an appropriate notional commencement date.
    This commencement date would have given the appellant a further six months of
    spousal support or $6,210.<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Accordingly, we increase the spousal support damages
    by $6,210 and order prejudgment interest on that amount at the 4 per cent rate awarded
    by the trial judge.  We would otherwise
    dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant achieved some limited success on the
    appeal on the issue of spousal support.  However, the respondent was successful in resisting the weight of the
    appeal.  In light of this result, costs
    to the respondent are fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
