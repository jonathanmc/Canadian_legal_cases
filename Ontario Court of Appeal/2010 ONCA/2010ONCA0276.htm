    plants, 465 of which were being grown outdoors and 126 of which were being
    grown in the outbuildings and residence.  They also seized: ten and a half pounds of processed marihuana; some
    drug paraphernalia such as digital scales, packing material and scissors; a

    on marihuana production, distribution and projected marihuana plant yields.  In addition to evidence on the value of the
    marihuana, set out above, the key aspects of D.C. Kroll’s evidence can be
    summarized as follows.  The property looked
    like a farm.  Less than an acre of the
    land was being used to grow marihuana.  While there was some attempt to hide the outdoor grow operation by
    planting a small patch of corn in front of the plants, the farm had not been
    set up to hide the grow operation and there were no booby traps.  The plants were being watered and properly
    fertilized and appeared to have a lot of bud.  </span></p>

    done was a mistake and he was stupid.  He
    said that he got involved because he was behind in property taxes and owed
    approximately $5,000 in that regard.  His
    income at the relevant time consisted of a yearly pension of $25,000 and
    after-tax income from farming of approximately $500 per year.  </span></p>

    been contacted by undisclosed people and asked to supply his land to grow and
    cultivate marihuana.  The amount he was
    to be paid was dependent on the weight of the crop.  He expected to make between $10,000 and
    $30,000 for growing the marihuana.  He
    estimated the size of the property used to grow the marihuana to be between one-third
    and one-half of an acre.  At the time of
    the offence, he testified that the farm property was approximately 120 acres in
    size, of which 70 acres was arable land on which he planted crops and the
    balance was bush and pasture for the cattle he raised.  He had been involved in the grow operation
    for one year.  None of the marihuana had
    been sold.  He had been smoking marihuana
    because of depression.  The weapons found
    on his premises were for protection from raccoons.</span></p>

    prison for the <i>CDSA </i>offences.  It also brought an application for full
    forfeiture of the appellant’s real property.  The defence asked for a conditional sentence and a fine of $50,000,
    secured against the property, in lieu of forfeiture of the offence-related
    property.</span></p>

    real property.  Accordingly, one would
    have thought that the legal description to the property and all the salient features
    regarding ownership of that property would be clear on the record.  However, that is not the case.  Title to the property in the present case is
    something of a mystery – so much so that it is unclear whether the property in
    question consists of one parcel of land or two.    </span></p>

    Ontario.  The transfer deed contained in
    the record shows that Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> and his then common
    law wife originally purchased property that is legally described as part lots
    11 and 12, Concession 1, Municipality of West Elgin, County of Elgin, Township
    of <span class=SpellE>Aldborough</span> (the “farm property”). They paid $122,500
    for the farm property.  It consists of approximately
    122 acres and is a functioning farm whose primary crop is soya.  Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel’s</span> home and the other farm buildings are on this parcel of land.      </span></p>

    that he paid $70,000 for the vacant land.  There are no title documents in the record for the vacant land and, as
    noted above, the transfer deed showing the original purchase by Mr. Van <span
class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> does not include this parcel of land – it is only
    for the farm property.    </span></p>

    separate properties.  In 2007, the farm

    may be only one property, which consists of two parcels of land.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, there is but a single municipal address for the two
    parcels of land.  Next, apparently there
    is a single mortgage in favour of Farm Credit Corporation that covers both

title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  The mortgage was apparently for $123,800 and
    taken out on March 17, 2006.  Further, when
    Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> and his common law wife separated in
    1999, he paid her $82,000 for her interest in the property and she executed a
    single quit claim over both parcels of land.  In addition, the original Crown application for forfeiture describes the
    two parcels as a single property.  And, the
    affidavit of D.C. Bhabha, filed in support of the forfeiture application, states
    that when he searched the title at the Land Registry office, the legal
    description of the property was for both parcels of land.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    there is a single property, consisting of two parcels of land or whether there
    are two parcels of land, each with its own title.  This uncertainty has ramifications for the
    forfeiture application, as will be seen below.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Crown’s application for forfeiture was brought in
    relation to both parcels of land.  It was
    framed on the basis that there is a single property consisting of two parcels
    of land.  However, before the sentencing
    judge, the Crown sought “full forfeiture” of the farm property alone, stating
    that the vacant land was not offence-related property.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On appeal, the Crown’s position is baffling.  In its factum, it asserts that the sentencing
    judge ordered full forfeiture of the farm property.  For an order of full forfeiture to have been
    made, title to the farm property must be separate from that of the vacant
    land.  In oral argument, however, the
    Crown appeared to take the position that the order below was for partial forfeiture.  This position is based on the notion that
    there is a single property and, as the forfeiture order covered only the farm
    property parcel, the forfeiture order must be partial in nature.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In any event, the Crown could not tell the court how a forfeiture
    order in relation to the farm property might be implemented.  The Crown suggested that it might be by way
    of placing a charge against the property.  It also suggested that if the forfeiture order stands, it might bring an
    application to force the sale of the land so that the Crown could realize on whatever
    it was entitled to.  If the Crown were to
    force sale of the land, its position was that Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> could live in a trailer on the vacant land.  While Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> acknowledged such a
    possibility in cross examination at the sentencing hearing, there was no
    indication of whether services – such as electricity and sewers – run to the
    vacant land.       </span></p>

    the impact that sale would have on the mortgage, which it will be recalled, is
    a single mortgage against both parcels of land.  Would the mortgage be discharged from the sale proceeds, apportioned as
    against the two properties or remain against only the vacant land?  In this regard, the appellant testified that
    the balance owing on the mortgage is between $70,000 and $80,000.    </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Your
    Parliament has permitted sentencing judges to exercise discretion where a
    forfeiture would be disproportionate having regard to the circumstances of the
    offence.  <i>I read this to mean that the nature of some offences that would result
    in a prosecution under the sections of the C.D.S.A. might be so exceptional, so
    unusual, so minor or so technical in nature that the use of forfeiture
    provisions would simply be unfair</i>.  [Emphasis
    added; emphasis in original omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In other words, the sentencing judge was of the view that forfeiture
    orders for offence-related real property must be made in all but the most exceptional
    cases, such as those where the offences are minor or technical in nature.  It is clear from the trilogy that s. 19.1(3)
    is not so limited.  When considering s.
    19.1(3), the courts are to determine whether the impact of the forfeiture order
    would be disproportionate having regard to the three factors set out in the
    provision.  Relief against forfeiture is
    not restricted to cases in which the offences are minor or technical in nature.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Having found that the sentencing judge erred in principle in making
    the forfeiture order, the order cannot stand.  It falls to this court to determine whether to make such an order.  However, the deficiencies in the application
    record prevent this court from making such a determination.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Section 16(1) of the <i>CDSA </i>provides that forfeiture of property shall be ordered where the court is
    satisfied that the property is offence-related.  It is self-evident that the court must know what property is under
    consideration in order to make this first determination.  In the present case, because the state of the
    title is unclear, it cannot be known what property is under consideration.  Is the court considering a single property
    that consists of two parcels or, if there are separate titles for both parcels
    of land, is the court considering only the farm property?    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Further, s. 19.1(3) requires the court to consider whether the
    impact of an order of forfeiture would be disproportionate to the three factors
    set out in that provision.  In order for
    the court to decide this matter, it must first understand the impact such an
    order would have.  In this case, it is
    not possible to know what will happen if the forfeiture order is made, so it is
    not possible to know its impact.  Even if
    there is a separate title for the farm property, <i>Craig </i>dictates that the court must consider whether the order
    should be for full, partial or non-forfeiture.  If an order of partial forfeiture is made against the farm property, how
    much would it be for and how would the order be implemented?  As a charge against the property?  Would Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> be able to continue to live on the farm property?  Would the Crown seek to have the farm
    property sold so it could realize on the order?  If either a full or partial forfeiture order is made, what would happen
    to the mortgage that extends across both properties?  If the impact of the order is that Mr. Van <span
class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> can no longer live on the farm property, is the
    vacant land serviced and in a condition such that Mr. Van <span class=SpellE>Bemmel</span> could live in a trailer on it?  If there
    is but a single property, then all of the foregoing questions and more arise,
    beginning with a determination of what part of the property is
    “offence-related”.   </span></p>

    the Crown.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Baldasaro</i></span>, the court ordered
    forfeiture of 50 per cent of the equity that the appellants had in the house in
    which they lived, a house which the trial judge described as “a marihuana </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE><span

style='line-height:200%'> store operated for
    profit”.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Baldasaro</i></span>, the record made it
    clear why an order of 50 per cent forfeiture would be appropriate – one half of
    the house could be properly characterized as offence-related property.  Further, the record showed how a partial
    forfeiture order could be realized.  The
    mortgagee had possession of the property and had determined the value of the
    appellant’s equity in it.  As has been
    pointed out, the record in the present case does not provide information
