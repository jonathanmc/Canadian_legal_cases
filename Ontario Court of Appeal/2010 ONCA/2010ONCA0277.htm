  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves the availability and priority of
    automobile insurance with respect to a tort claim against the owner and driver
    of a rented vehicle as a result of a single car accident brought by the renter
    of the vehicle who was a passenger in the rented vehicle at the time of the
    accident.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application arises out of a single vehicle
    accident.  The vehicle involved in the
    accident was owned by Enterprise Rent-a-Car Canada Limited (“Enterprise”) and
    insured under a policy issued by ACE INA.  Paul Lee, the individual who had rented the vehicle from Enterprise, was
    a passenger at the time of the accident.  Both Lee and another passenger, Annie Koo, were injured in the
    accident.  Lee and Koo brought a tort
    claim against Enterprise, as the owner of the vehicle, and against the driver
    of the vehicle, Ya Nan Zhou.  Zhou was
    driving the vehicle with Lee’s consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee holds a standard automobile policy for his own
    vehicle issued by the appellant, Meloche Monnex Financial Services Inc.
    (“Meloche Monnex”).  Zhou has no
    automobile insurance policy.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>POLICY PROVISIONS AND LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal deals with the interpretation of amendments
    to <i>Standard Ontario Automobile Policy</i> (“O.A.P. 1”), ss. 2.2.4 and 3.3.5, the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8  s. 277(1.1),
    and the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. H.8, s. 192(3), introduced in 2006 to make renters liable for damages
    sustained by reason of negligence in the operation of a rented vehicle, and to
    relieve the insurer of the owner of a rented vehicle from being the first loss
    insurer where other insurance is available to the renter or driver of the
    rented vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 192(3) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> makes a “lessee”, defined in s. 191.9 as including
    persons who rent vehicles for any period of time, liable in the following
    terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>192 (3) A lessee of a motor vehicle or street car
    is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in
    the operation of the motor vehicle or street car on a highway, unless the motor
    vehicle or street car was without the lessee’s consent in the possession of
    some person other than the lessee or the lessee’s chauffeur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee’s Meloche Monnex O.A.P. 1 policy provides as
    follows with respect to rented and leased vehicles:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>2.2.4 Other Automobiles that
    are Rented or Leased </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rented and renting as equivalent to <span class=GramE>leased</span> and leasing. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition to the coverages referred to in subsection 2.2.3, the
    following coverage applies to rented automobiles if a premium is shown for the
    coverage on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance for a described automobile: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Liability </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Automobiles, other than a described automobile, are covered as described
    in this subsection when rented by you, or by your spouse who lives with you,
    for periods of not more than 30 days, <i>but
    only with respect to the liability of the person renting the automobile arising
    from the negligence of the driver of that automobile</i>, and only if the
    driver is not an excluded driver under this policy. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>3.3.5 Rented and Leased Automobiles </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rent, renter and rented as
    equivalent to lease, lessee and leased. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>This policy provides coverage for persons who rent an automobile, as
    described in the definitions of automobile in Section 2, as a result of liability imposed by law arising from the
    negligence of the driver of that automobile</i><b><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>. </span></i></b><i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a liability claim is made against a driver,
    renter or owner of a rented automobile, <i>coverage
    may be available</i> under more than one motor vehicle liability policy. The
    following rules govern the order in which the policies will respond: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1. <i>If
    insurance is available</i> to the person who rented the automobile, the policy
    providing that insurance responds first. </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2. <i>If
    insurance is available</i> to the driver of the rented automobile, the policy
    providing that insurance responds next. </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3. <i>If
    insurance is available</i> to the owner of the rented automobile, the policy
    providing that insurance responds last. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We have no liability for such claims in excess of
    the limit of liability coverage specified in the Certificate of Automobile
    Insurance and do not have the responsibility to defend such claims against
    anyone other than you, your spouse who lives with you, or the persons mentioned
    in subsections 2.2.3 (6) and 2.2.4 (6). [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The corresponding provisions of the <i>Insurance Act</i> are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P3714_388773"></a><a
name=s277s1></a><a name=BK303></a>277<a
name="P3716_389421"></a><a name=s277s1p1></a>(1.1) … if an automobile is leased,
    the following rules apply to determine the order in which the third party
    liability provisions <i>of any available
    motor vehicle liability policies</i> shall respond in respect of liability
    arising from or occurring in connection with the ownership or, directly or
    indirectly, with the use or operation of the automobile on or after the day
    this subsection comes into force:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1. Firstly, <i>insurance
    available</i> under a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy
    under which the lessee of the automobile is entitled to indemnity as an insured
    named in the contract.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2. Secondly, <i>insurance available</i> under a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle
    liability policy under which the driver of the automobile is entitled to
    indemnity, either as an insured named in the contract, as the spouse of an
    insured named in the contract who resides with that insured or as a driver
    named in the contract, is excess to the insurance referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3. Thirdly, <i>insurance
    available</i> under a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy
    under which the owner of the automobile is entitled to indemnity as an insured
    named in the contract is excess to the insurance referred to in paragraphs 1
    and 2. <span class=GramE>2005, c.&nbsp;31, Sched.</span>&nbsp;12,
    s.&nbsp;6&nbsp;(1). [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION
    OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application, brought by Enterprise, asked for an
    order declaring Meloche Monnex to be the first insurer to respond to the claims
    of Lee and Koo and requiring Meloche Monnex to defend and indemnify Enterprise
    and Zhou for these claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge granted the declarations sought
    on the basis of both O.A.P. 1 and s. 277(1.1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected Meloche Monnex’s
    argument that as no claim for vicarious liability was advanced against Lee, his
    Meloche Monnex policy was not “available”.   The application judge concluded, accordingly, that the Meloche Monnex
    policy stood as the first insurance to cover the claims made against Enterprise
    and Zhou.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While a number of grounds of appeal were raised in the
    notice of appeal and factum, we were advised by the parties that those issues
    have been now resolved or can otherwise be dealt with if we determine the
    following issue: is Meloche Monnex the first insurer to respond to the claims
    of Lee and Koo against Enterprise and Zhou? </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the language of s. 3.3.5 of the policy
    and from s. 277(1.1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> that if Lee’s Meloche Monnex policy is “available” it is the first to respond. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The real issue is whether Lee’s Meloche Monnex policy
    is “available” with respect to a tort claim brought by him and Koo against the
    driver and owner of the vehicle he rented. In my view, the answer to that
    question is no. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The claim is certainly one, in the words of s.
    3.3.5 of O.A.P. 1, for “liability imposed by law arising from the negligence of
    the driver of that automobile”.  However,
    with respect to rented vehicles, the same policy provides coverage, in the
    words of s. 2.2.4, “<span style='line-height:200%;
'>only with respect to the liability of the person
    renting the automobile arising from the negligence of the driver of that
    automobile”</span> or, in the words of s. 3.3.5, “for persons who rent an
    automobile …<i> </i>as a result of liability
    imposed by law arising from the negligence of the driver of that automobile”.<span
style='line-height:200%'>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Simply put, the policy provides coverage where a
    liability claim is asserted against the renter either as driver or, where the
    vehicle was being driven by someone else with the renter’s consent, as the
    renter. <span style='line-height:200%'>The policy
    would provide coverage for Lee with respect to any claims brought <i>against him</i> arising from the negligence
    of the driver of the rented vehicle, but </span>it provides no coverage with
    respect to other claims.  In other words,
    although the policy would be “available” to Lee should a claim be brought
    against him, it is not available in this action as no claim asserted is capable
    of triggering an obligation on the part of Meloche Monnex to respond. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We were not referred to any other provision in Lee’s
    Meloche Monnex policy or in the <i>Insurance
    Act</i> that provides coverage for Enterprise and Zhou with respect to these
    claims.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An individual, such as Zhou, who drives an automobile
    with the owner’s <span class=GramE>consent</span> is covered by the owner’s
    policy by virtue of s. 239(1) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, but that coverage only applies where that person is driving the
    automobile described in the owner’s policy. Section 239(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P2923_272708"></a><a name=s239s1></a><a
name=BK237></a>239. (1) Subject
    to section 240, every contract evidenced by an owner’s policy insures the
    person named therein, and every other person who with the named person’s
    consent drives, or is an occupant of, <i>an
    automobile owned by the insured named in the contract and within the
    description or definition thereof in the contract</i>, against liability
    imposed by law upon the insured named in the contract or that other person for
    loss or damage,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>arising</span> from the
    ownership or directly or indirectly from the use or operation of any such
    automobile; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) <span class=GramE>resulting</span> from
    bodily injury to or the death of any person and damage to property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, if Lee had been a passenger in his own
    vehicle, the “automobile owned by the insured named in the contract”, and
    injured as a result of Zhou’s negligence as the driver, Meloche Monnex would
    have been obliged to provide Zhou with coverage for Lee’s tort claim.  However, there is nothing in O.A.P. 1 or the <i>Insurance Act</i> extending that coverage to
    vehicles rented by the insured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The claims advanced by Lee and Koo against Zhou
    and Enterprise, as presently framed, are simply not covered by the “Other
    Automobiles that are Rented or Leased” provision of the Meloche Monnex policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The priority provisions of s. 3.3.5 of the O.A.P. 1 and
    s. 277(1) of the <i>Insurance Act </i>apply
    only if “insurance is available.” As Lee’s Meloche Monnex policy does not
    provide coverage for the claims asserted, it is not “available” and the
    priority provisions cannot render Meloche Monnex liable to provide coverage. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
    set aside the judgment, with costs to the appellant fixed at $5000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
