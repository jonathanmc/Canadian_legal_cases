    licence was under suspension in contravention of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  The trial proceeded <i>ex parte</i>.  The appellant was
    sentenced to 10 days in jail and ordered to pay a fine of $7,500.  </p>

    appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice.  Young J. (the “appeal judge”) dismissed that appeal on February 4,
    2008.  Simmons J.A. granted leave to

    to the nature of the order made by the appeal judge.  Specifically, the Crown characterizes the
    order as a refusal of leave to extend the time to appeal to the Ontario Court
    of Justice.  The appellant characterizes
    the order as a dismissal of the appeal.  It is not entirely clear from the transcript whether the appeal judge
    dismissed the motion for an extension or dismissed the appeal itself.  On balance, however, I am satisfied that he
    dismissed the appeal.  </p>

  <h2>The Factual Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged on July 3, 2003, with
    driving while his licence was under suspension.  He was given a summons by the police officer compelling him to appear in
    court on July 29, 2003.  The appellant
    did not attend.  The matter was adjourned
    to November 10, 2003, for trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his affidavit and cross-examination filed in
    this court, the appellant contends that he did not attend court on July 29,
    2003, because he was not feeling well.<span class=MsoCommentReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span></span>  He asserts that he attempted to get his
    sister to go to court for him, but she could not attend.  The appellant has considerable experience
    with both the criminal justice system and the provincial offences regime.  He clearly understood the need to go to court
    and that he could have someone attend on his behalf.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 27, 2003, the appellant, who was
    prohibited from driving under both the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>and the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>,
    was once again found driving his motor vehicle.  He was arrested and taken into custody on several charges, including
    another charge of driving while his licence was suspended under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  The appellant was held in custody and, on
    October 6, 2003, pled guilty to the charges arising out of the August 27, 2003
    arrest.  He received a sentence of four
    months in addition to the six weeks he had spent in custody prior to his plea.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his affidavit and cross-examination, the
    appellant asserts that he understood that his guilty pleas on October 6, 2003, encompassed
    all of his outstanding driving charges, including the charge that was laid on
    July 3, 2003.  There is no evidence that
    the appellant made any inquiries or that anyone told him that his October 6,
    2003 guilty pleas included the July 3, 2003 charge.  Nothing in the record of the proceedings on
    October 6, 2003, suggests that any of the guilty pleas referred to the earlier
    charge.  The appellant’s claim comes down
    to an assertion that he assumed, without any basis for doing so, that all of
    his outstanding matters were being dealt with on October 6, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was in custody when the July 3,
    2003 charge, which was adjourned on July 29, 2003, came on for trial on November
    10, 2003.  The appellant had no idea that
    his trial was scheduled for that day because he did not attend as required by
    the summons on July 29, 2003, and made no inquiries in the intervening three
    months to determine his trial date.  The
    appellant knew that he could find out his trial date by calling the courthouse
    indicated on the summons.   In any event, the appellant’s claim that he
    assumed that the July 3, 2003 charge was disposed of on October 6, 2003, forecloses
    any suggestion that, had he not been in custody, he would have attended his
    trial on November 10, 2003.  The fact
    that the appellant was in custody on November 10, 2003, had nothing to do with
    his failure to attend at his trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court proceeded with an <i>ex parte</i> trial on November 10, 2003.  The evidence established that the appellant
    was driving while his licence was under suspension on July 3, 2003.  The prosecutor requested a jail sentence of
    seven to 15 days primarily because the appellant had a prior conviction for
    driving while his licence was under suspension.  The prosecutor also requested the minimum $5,000 fine.  The trial judge imposed a sentence of 10 days
    in jail and a fine of $7,500.  A warrant
    was issued for the appellant’s arrest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was in custody serving the
    sentence imposed on October 6, 2003, until December 26, 2003.  The warrant issued on November 10, 2003, was
    not executed until June 2, 2004.  The
    police attended at a dispute between the appellant and his landlord and, when a
    CPIC check revealed the outstanding warrant, arrested the appellant.  He served his 10-day sentence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About three years after he completed his
    sentence, the appellant made inquiries about the status of his licence.  He anticipated that his various driving
    prohibitions and license suspensions would soon expire and that he would once
    again be eligible for a licence.  He was
    told that in addition to the prohibitions and suspensions, there were a number
    of outstanding fines, including the $7,500 fine imposed on November 10,
    2003.  He could not recover his licence as
    long as his fines remained unpaid.  Consequently,
    in July 2007, the appellant launched appeals from various convictions arising
    out of different proceedings, including an appeal from the November 10, 2003
    conviction and sentence.<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  In that appeal, the appellant claimed that he
    could not attend his trial on November 10, 2003, because he was in
    custody.  </p>
  <h2>  The Constitutionality of Section
    54(1)(a)</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relevant part of s. 54(1) of the Act
    provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where a defendant does not appear at the time and
    place appointed for a hearing and it is proved by the prosecutor, having been
    given a reasonable opportunity to do so, that a summons was served, … the court
    may, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>proceed
    to hear and determine the proceeding in the absence of the defendant; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>adjourn
    the hearing and, if it thinks fit, issue a summons to appear or issue a warrant
    in the prescribed form for the arrest of the defendant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 54 appears in Part IV of the Act.  That Part applies to any proceeding commenced
    under the Act, including Part III proceedings like the one at issue.  Part III proceedings involve the more serious
    offences prosecuted under the Act and provide a procedure that is much like the
    one found in the summary conviction provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was properly served with a summons
    requiring him to attend court on July 29, 2003.  He did not attend on that date, nor did he attend on the trial date of
    November 10, 2003.  Under s. 54(1)(a) of
    the Act, the court had the jurisdiction to proceed <i>ex parte</i> with the trial and with the sentencing if the appellant
    was convicted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Amicus</i> does not take issue with the court’s statutory authority to proceed <i>ex parte</i> under s. 54(1)(a), but claims
    that the section is unconstitutional, at least where there is the potential for
    incarceration.  Counsel argues that the appellant’s
    failure to attend as required by the summons cannot be viewed as an implied
    waiver of his constitutional right to attend and participate in his trial.  Counsel submits that the present scheme does
    not distinguish between defendants who actually choose not to attend and defendants
    who, for valid reasons, cannot attend their trial.  Counsel further contends that mere
    non-attendance cannot give rise to an implied waiver of constitutional rights
    unless there are safeguards sufficient to ensure that the defendant did, in
    fact, waive those rights.  Counsel
    submits that the Act does not contain those safeguards either in the processes
    governing <i>ex parte </i>trials or in the
    procedures available for challenging the results of those trials.  Counsel refers to the provisions applicable
    to indictable criminal offences that require proof that the accused has
    absconded before the court can proceed in their absence as the kind of legislation
    that would provide adequate constitutional protection:  see s. 475 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel submits that this court should
    decline to hear the constitutional issue because it was not raised before the
    appeal judge.   Generally speaking, appeal courts will not
    hear arguments that were not made below.  The court does, however, have a discretion to hear those arguments.  I am satisfied given the nature of the
    constitutional argument that it can be fully, effectively and fairly addressed
    on appeal.  The appeal record assembled
    by the parties and the submissions of counsel contain the information necessary
    to determine whether s. 54(1)(a) of the Act violates either s. 11(d) or s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i>:  see <i>R.
    v. Roach</i> (2009), 246 O.A.C. 96 (C.A.) at paras. 6-8.</p>

    offences, provided that a failure to respond to a ticket within a given time
    constituted a waiver of a right to trial and resulted in a conviction without
    any inquiry into the merits of the allegation.  The legislation in <i>Richard</i> is
    similar to that found in Part I of the Act.  Part I of the Act applies only to minor regulatory offences.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    LaForest J., for a unanimous court, held that the legislation was
    constitutional, stating at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is therefore my view that the New Brunswick legislature
    has acted in accordance with the <i>Charter</i>.  While it is true that it has established a
    scheme that deprives accused persons of the benefit of s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>, that deprivation operates in
    circumstances where the litigants involved have in any event validly waived
    their right to be presumed innocent and their right to a fair and public
    hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Amicus</i> submits that the court in <i>Richard</i> accepted that a defendant’s failure to respond to a ticket constituted a waiver
    of constitutional rights only because the offences in question were purely
    regulatory and a defendant did not face the risk of imprisonment if
    convicted.  Counsel submits that the
    reasoning in <i>Richard</i> is some
    indication that, where the liberty interest of a defendant is engaged by the
    risk of imprisonment, more than mere non-attendance will be required to imply a
    waiver of constitutional rights.  Counsel
    submits that <i>Richard</i> casts doubt on
    the reasoning in <i>Felipa</i> and should
    signal a reconsideration of that decision by this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree that the regulatory nature of the
    offences in question and the absence of any possibility of imprisonment were
    important contextual considerations in <i>Richard</i>:  see <i>Richard</i> at para. 30.  I do not, however, agree
    that the analysis in <i>Richard</i> has any
    bearing on the <i>Felipa</i> analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The statutory provision upheld in <i>Richard</i> not only denied the defendant the
    right to a trial, but also presumed the defendant’s guilt if he did not respond
    to the ticket within the designated time.  Section 54(1)(a) of the Act<i> </i>has no such effect.  A defendant who does not appear for his trial
    is still presumed innocent.  In the <i>ex parte</i> proceedings, the prosecutor
    must prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt according to the
    generally applicable evidentiary and procedural rules.  The defendant has a trial before an
    independent and impartial tribunal.  As
    Houlden J.A. concisely put it in <i>Felipa</i>,
    the Act simply provides a mechanism for proceeding with a trial where the defendant
    does not avail him or herself of the right to appear at that trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As stressed in <i>Richard</i> at paras. 28-29, constitutional rights, including those
    protected by ss. 7 and 11(d), can only be given meaning within a specific
    context.  The reasoning in <i>Richard</i> addresses a fundamentally
    different legislative scheme than that at issue in this case.  Nothing in <i>Richard</i> causes me to doubt the correctness of the analysis in <i>Felipa</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A litigant seeking to have this court overturn
    one of its prior decisions must demonstrate compelling circumstances that justify
    departure from earlier authority.  It is
    not enough to simply show that a good argument can be made for taking a different
    view of the law.  The rationale
    underlying the institutional reluctance to overrule earlier decisions and the
    factors that may cause a court to overrule its earlier decisions are clearly set
    out in <i>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v.
    Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</i> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at
    paras. 118-127, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (2006), 216 O.A.C. 399n.  Only one of the factors identified in <i>Polowin</i> exists in this case – overruling <i>Felipa</i> would establish a rule more
    favourable to the accused:  <i>Polowin </i>at para. 124.  That factor standing alone cannot justify
    overruling a prior authority.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    factor that would justify overruling <i>Felipa</i>.  No case has been made out for reconsidering
    that decision.  Certainly, I am not
    satisfied that it is “manifestly wrong”:  <i>Polowin</i> at para. 126.  To the contrary, I think it is right.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In upholding the constitutionality of <i>ex parte</i> trials under the Act, I do not
    suggest that they are or should become the norm.<a

'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  Clearly, there is a risk of a miscarriage of
    justice inherent in an <i>ex parte</i> proceeding that does not exist where the defendant is present.  This risk exists despite the significant legislative
    and administrative safeguards in place to facilitate a defendant’s appearance at
    trial personally, by counsel or through an agent.  For example, a defendant can, with a simple
    phone call to the location identified in the summons, find out when his or her
    trial is scheduled even if the defendant has missed the return date on the
    summons.  In addition, some, but not all,
    miscarriages occasioned by <i>ex parte</i> proceedings can be rectified on appeal.  To
    acknowledge that an <i>ex parte</i> proceeding can result in a miscarriage of justice does not, however, advance
    the constitutional analysis.  A procedure
    need not be foolproof to be constitutional.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prosecutors and judges have a role to play in
    minimizing the risk of miscarriages of justice through <i>ex parte</i> proceedings.  An <i>ex parte</i> trial is not automatic when a
    defendant fails to appear in answer to a charge under Part III of the Act.  The prosecutor must request an <i>ex parte</i> trial and the trial judge has the
    discretion to proceed <i>ex parte</i> or to take
    other steps, usually the issuance of a warrant, to compel the attendance of the
    defendant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court was told in oral argument that there
    are no formal guidelines in place to assist prosecutors in deciding when to
    request an <i>ex parte</i> trial.  In every case where the prosecutor will seek
    a custodial sentence upon conviction, the prosecutor would be well-advised to
    consider whether an <i>ex parte</i> proceeding is appropriate.  The longer
    the period of imprisonment sought, the less inclined the prosecutor should be
    to request an <i>ex parte </i>trial.  If the prosecutor ultimately decides that it
    would be proper to proceed <i>ex parte</i>, he
    or she should advise the trial judge, before the trial begins, of their
    intention to seek a custodial sentence and the range of sentence that they
    anticipate will be appropriate.  The
    trial judge can use this information to decide whether to proceed with the
    trial or take other action, such as adjourn the hearing and issue a warrant for
    the defendant’s arrest. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, it is worth noting that, as observed by
    Simmons J.A. during the oral argument of this appeal, declining to proceed <i>ex parte</i> and issuing a warrant for the
    arrest of the defendant carries its own significant risk of an unnecessary deprivation
    of liberty.  Issuing a warrant is often
    the only viable alternative to an <i>ex parte</i> proceeding where the defendant has not appeared in answer to a summons.  A person arrested on a warrant issued when he
    or she did not attend their trial may well spend some time in custody before
    that trial is held or the person is released on bail.  If the person is convicted and receives a
    non-custodial sentence, he or she will have spent more time in custody than
    would have been the case had the trial proceeded <i>ex parte</i>.  This risk is
    significant given that the vast majority of <i>ex
    parte</i> trials do not result in sentences of imprisonment.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would uphold the constitutionality of s. 54(1)(a)
    of the <i>Act</i>.  The court has jurisdiction to proceed with an <i>ex parte</i> trial when the conditions
    precedent under the statute are met.  Whether the court should do so, will depend on the circumstances.  The exercise of that discretion in a specific
    case is reviewable on appeal.</p>
  <h2>The Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are several procedural problems associated
    with the conviction appeal.  The
    appellant was self-represented in the lower court.  In this court, initially Crown counsel, and
    subsequently Mr. Glick as <i>amicus</i>, recognized
    a potential injustice and did their best to create a record and get to the
    merits of the appellant’s claims.  The
    court acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of Crown counsel and Mr.
    Glick.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I propose to address the merits of the
    conviction appeal based on the record that is before this court.  In doing so, however, I stress that virtually
    none of this material was before the appeal judge.  He cannot be criticized for the manner in
    which he addressed the appeal given the material that was before him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant complains that the conviction entered
    and sentence imposed on November 10, 2003, were unfair because he did not know
    anything about those proceedings, was in custody on other matters and,
    therefore, was unable to attend the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A valid explanation for non-attendance offered
    on appeal may justify setting aside a conviction entered after an <i>ex parte</i> trial.  There is no valid explanation here.  The appellant did not know about the trial
    date because he chose not to attend on July 29, 2003, as required by the
    summons.  He knew he was required to
    attend and he knew that if for some reason he could not attend, someone could
    attend on his behalf.  He took no
    meaningful steps to either appear in person or have someone appear for
    him.  The appellant made no attempt after
    July 29, 2003, to determine his trial date.  He knew that his trial date could be determined by a simple phone call
    to the courthouse identified on the summons.  He has offered no acceptable explanation for not taking any steps to
    determine his trial date or to have anyone attend on his behalf.  Furthermore, on the appellant’s own version
    of events, he was not concerned about the July 3, 2003 charge because he
    assumed he had pled guilty to that charge and others in October.  On his version of events, he believed that he
    had pled guilty to the July 3, 2003 charge on October 6, 2003, and was serving
    his sentence on November 10, 2003.  While
    that belief was entirely unreasonable, the fact remains that whether the
    appellant was in or out of jail, he would not have gone to court in answer to
    the July 3, 2003 charge on November 10, 2003.  His incarceration was irrelevant to his failure to attend.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The real explanation for the appellant’s absence
    at his trial is clear.  He chose not to
    go to court on July 29, 2003, although he knew he was required to go to court.  The appellant chose to do nothing to find out
    when his trial was scheduled.  He did
    nothing about it because it was of no concern to him.  He chose to ignore the charge.  The appellant became concerned only years
    later when the outstanding fine flowing from his November 10, 2003 conviction became
    an inconvenience for him.  Nothing in the
    specific circumstances of this case would justify setting aside the conviction
    entered after the <i>ex parte</i> trial on
    November 10, 2003.</p>
  <h2>The Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentence appeal centres on the quantum of
    the fine imposed at trial and the appeal judge’s failure to consider the
    sentence appeal on its merits.  At trial,
    the prosecutor asked for the imposition of the minimum fine of $5,000.  The trial judge, without giving any reasons
    for doing so, imposed a fine of $7,500.  As the matter had proceeded <i>ex parte</i>,
    he did so without the benefit of any information concerning the appellant other
    than his criminal and driving records.  The trial judge made no reference to these records when imposing the
    $7,500 fine.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal judge did not deal with the sentence
    appeal on its merits.  This is
    understandable as the appellant had not filed anything that would assist the appeal
    judge in addressing the sentence appeal.  Specifically, the appellant had not filed the trial transcript.  We now have that transcript and additional
    material.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel has fairly conceded that the trial
    judge erred in principle in imposing a larger fine than was requested by the prosecutor
    without giving any reasons for doing so.  The Crown also fairly acknowledges that it can offer no justification
    for increasing the fine beyond the minimum fine requested by the prosecutor.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant accepts the Crown’s
    concessions, but argues that this is an appropriate case to exercise the
    jurisdiction under s. 59(2) of the Act and impose a fine that is lower than the
    minimum fine.  Counsel advised the court
    that the appellant has limited means and that, while he is presently paying off
    his fines in accordance with a payment schedule set for him, those payments are
    onerous for him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would allow the appeal from sentence and
    impose the minimum of $5,000.  Fairness
    dictates that trial judges should not impose a greater sentence than the one
    requested by the prosecutor in an <i>ex
    parte</i> trial without giving good reasons for doing so.  Specific factors justifying the increase
    should be identified before the trial judge goes beyond the sentence requested
    by the prosecutor.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has not, however, made out a case
    for the imposition of a fine below the statutory minimum.  If the payments are posing a real problem,
    the appellant has potential remedies under s. 69 of the Act.  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would hold that the <i>ex parte</i> trial provision in the Act is constitutional.  I would dismiss the conviction appeal.  I would allow the sentence appeal and vary
    the fine from $7,500 to $5,000.</p>
