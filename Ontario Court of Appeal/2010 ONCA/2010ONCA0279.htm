  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Foundos and Ms. Condoyannis were married for 22
    years.  They separated in September,
    1990.  They have two children, now
    adults.  At the time of separation, the
    parties had only two significant family assets, both of which had been
    purchased during the marriage using family funds: the matrimonial home and the
    family business.  The family business was
    a company that owned a gas bar and automobile repair centre on Islington Avenue
    in Toronto.  Mr. Foundos was the sole
    shareholder of the company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the divorce proceedings, Mr. Foundos took the
    position that although the business had been valued at approximately $1.1
    million, it had no value because the land on which it was located was environmentally
    contaminated and the cost of remediation would exceed any equity in the
    business.  Ms. Condoyannis did not have
    the necessary funds to obtain her own valuation of the business.  She did not trust Mr. Foundos, believing that
    he would find some way to benefit from the business and deprive her of her
    share in it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1996, the parties attended a case conference and
    executed Minutes of Settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1999, the family home was sold and both parties
    received their share of the proceeds, in accordance with the terms of the
    Minutes of Settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2006, Mr. Foundos sold the family business for
    $900,000 but refused to pay Ms. Condoyannis any of the proceeds of sale.  The business was sold without any
    environmental cleanup having been performed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Condoyannis brought an application in which she
    sought, among other things<span class=GramE>,  to</span> share in the proceeds of sale of the
    family business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues in the proceeding were bifurcated.  The first trial was devoted to interpreting para.
    5 in the Minutes of Settlement, which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.  If the
    business of the husband is sold within four years, and the value of the
    business at the time exceeds the total of the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. current encumbrances;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>B. notional real estate commission;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>C. soil removal;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>D. reasonable costs of sale;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>E. current business loans;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>then</span> the wife shall be
    entitled to thirty-five per cent of the aforesaid net proceeds of sale.  The wife shall have the option of obtaining
    at her own expense a proper business valuation.  If the wife’s valuation shows that the value of the business exceeds the
    total of A, B, C, D &amp; E above, <span class=GramE>then</span> the husband
    shall have the option of having he business sold or of buying the wife’s
    interest.  In either event, the wife
    shall get thirty-five per cent of the notional or actual net proceeds of sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Mr. Foundos argued that para. 5 extinguished
    Ms. Condoyannis’ right to share in the sale proceeds of the business.  He contended that para. 5 gave Ms.
    Condoyannis a right to: (1) share in the sale proceeds from the business, so
    long as the business was sold within four years from the execution of the
    Minutes of Settlement, and (2) obtain a valuation of the business within that
    same four-year period.  As she did
    neither, her rights were extinguished.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge disagreed.  She found that para. 5 <span class=GramE>was</span> ambiguous.  She viewed the ambiguity in
    para. 5 as relating to the valuation.  She noted that while para. 5 gave the wife the right to obtain a business <span class=GramE>valuation,</span> it did not specify whether that right had
    to be exercised within the four-year period.  The trial judge admitted parole evidence to resolve the ambiguity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties have sued the solicitors who represented
    them at the time that the Minutes of Settlement were entered into for
    negligence.  Those solicitors gave
    evidence at the trial, as did the parties themselves.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Condoyannis and her solicitor were adamant that she
    would never have agreed to extinguish her rights to the business after 4 years
    and that she would not have settled on that basis.  Ms. Condoyannis testified that her solicitor
    told her that whenever the business was sold, she would get 35 per cent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Foundos testified that when he signed the Minutes
    of Settlement, his solicitor advised him that Ms. Condoyannis would have no
    further claim against the business after the four-year period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence from both sides established that in the period
    leading up to the execution of the Minutes of Settlement, two case conferences were
    held.  Only the parties’ then solicitors
    attended the first case conference.  An
    undated handwritten document initialled by the lawyers and entitled “Proposal
    for Settlement” was entered into evidence.  It was not clear whether the Proposal was prepared at the first case
    conference and when the changes that had been handwritten on the Proposal had
    been made.  The Proposal was in the
    handwriting of the husband’s lawyer, except for the last sentence of paragraph
    5 which was in the handwriting of the wife’s solicitor.  Para. 5 of the Proposal reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If business sold within 4 years and there are net
    proceeds after payment of all encumbrances, business loans and soil removal,
    legal costs and other expenses of sale, wife will get 35% of net sale proceeds.  <span class=GramE>If business not sold then
    valuation conducted and wife to receive said interests.</span>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the second case conference, the parties were in
    separate areas and the lawyers were negotiating back and forth between them
    over the period of a few hours.  At the
    end of the negotiations, the husband’s lawyer drafted the Minutes of Settlement
    that are the subject of this proceeding.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge preferred the evidence of Ms.
    Condoyannis and her solicitor.  She found
    that Mr. Foundos was not a credible witness.  The trial judge said that Mr. Foundos struck her as “someone who was
    prepared to do or say anything that would assist him in defeating the wife’s
    rights”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that, properly interpreted, para.
    5 of the Minutes of Settlement gave Ms. <span class=SpellE>Condoyannis</span> entitlement
    to a 35 per cent interest in the business.  The calculation of its worth was to be by way of sale or valuation.  When the wife did not proceed to value the
    business after four years elapsed, the husband was free to sell, at which point
    the wife’s interest would be quantified, subject to deductions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave several reasons for so
    interpreting para. 5.  Both parties’
    interpretation of the Minutes allowed the wife to participate in changes in the
    value of the business after separation.  By the time the Minutes were signed, the parties had been separated for
    six years.  The parties’ agreement that
    the wife would participate in the value of the business going forward produced
    a different approach from the property regime provided for in the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, where
    value crystallizes at the date of separation.  As well, an interpretation that would deprive the wife of her interest
    in the business would require more specific language.  Further, the evidence of both lawyers was
    that the language used in the Minutes was not intended to alter the intent of
    the Proposal.  Finally, she found that a
    release by the wife of her rights to the business was never discussed.  Whereas the Minutes of Settlement provided
    for a release of spousal and child support after the completion of the payments
    called for in the Minutes, there was no similar provision in respect of the
    business after the four-year period.  The
    Minutes could easily and simply have provided for this.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Costs of the
    trial were ordered in favour of Ms. Condoyannis in the amount of $150,802.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Foundos appeals.  He makes a number of submissions to support his contention that the
    trial judge erred in the approach she took to interpreting the Minutes of
    Settlement.  The essence of his position,
    however, is as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Para. 5 <span
class=GramE>is</span> not ambiguous.  The
    correct interpretation is that which he advanced at trial, namely, that para. 5
    gave the wife a right to share in the sale proceeds from the business, so long
    as the business was sold within four years from the execution of the Minutes of
    Settlement, or to obtain a valuation within that same period.  As she did neither, her rights have been
    extinguished.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>If,
    however, para. 5 is ambiguous, the trial judge’s interpretation is
    incorrect.  The correct interpretation accords
    with that which he contends is the unambiguous meaning, identified above.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Foundos’ former solicitor made submissions to a
    similar effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his written submissions, Mr. Foundos also seeks
    leave to appeal the costs order, arguing that he should be entitled to costs of
    the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court found it unnecessary to call on the
    respondent.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>Interpreting paragraph 5 of the Minutes of Settlement</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Foundos argues that the trial judge erred by
    interpreting para. 5 in a manner other than that pleaded or argued by either
    party.  He relies on <i>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 74 (C.A.), for
    this contention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept that the trial judge was bound to
    accept one of the interpretations advanced by the parties and that failure to
    do so amounts to an error of law.  In <i>Rodaro</i>, the trial judge developed a
    novel theory of liability in his reasons for judgment, outside of the pleadings
    and the case as developed by the parties, and without having heard from the
    parties on that theory.  That is not this
    case.  In the present case, the trial
    judge had a single task to perform:  she
    was required to interpret para. 5 of the Minutes of Settlement.  Both sides were aware that the interpretation
    of para. 5 <span class=GramE>was</span> in issue and were fully and fairly
    heard on the matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do we accept that the trial judge erred in law by
    failing to apply the correct principles of contract interpretation.  On a fair and full reading of her reasons,
    the trial judge appears to have done the following.  She examined the Minutes of Settlement within
    its factual matrix, including the particular words used in para. 5 in their
    immediate context and in the context of the agreement as a whole.  Having done so, she found that there were two
    reasonably possible interpretations of para. 5.  Consequently, she admitted parole evidence to resolve the
    ambiguity.  The parole evidence included
    evidence of the facts that led to the making of the Minutes of Settlement and
    of the circumstances as they existed at the time the Minutes of Settlement were
    made.  She made no error in following
    this approach.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that para. 5 of the Minutes of Settlement <span
class=GramE>is</span> ambiguous.  There
    is nothing in para. 5 or elsewhere in the Minutes of Settlement that addresses
    what the wife’s entitlement to the business would be, if any, after four years
    had passed.  Moreover, as the trial judge
    noted, the Minutes do not contain a release of the wife’s right specific to the
    business after the four-year period expired, whereas the Minutes do contain a
    release of any right to spousal and child support after the completion of the
    payments called for in the Minutes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argues that the Proposal was
    inadmissible and reference by the trial judge to it constituted a legal error.  This submission is based on the principle
    that evidence of contractual negotiation is not to be considered when
    interpreting a contract – it is only the final document which is to be
    considered because it is that document which reflects the intentions of the
    parties.  The appellant relies on <i>Eco-Zone Engineering Ltd. v. Grand Falls-Windsor
    (Town) </i>(2000), 5 C.L.R. (3d) 55 (Nfld. C.A.), at para. 11.  That principle is inapplicable to the
    Proposal.  On the evidence of the parties
    and their solicitors, the Proposal was not part of the negotiations.  It was the document which the husband’s
    solicitor used as the basis for the Minutes of Settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was entitled to consider parole
    evidence to resolve the ambiguity in para. 5 and to make credibility findings,
    as she did.  Both parties testified about
    the Proposal as it was an integral aspect of the narrative and context.  In the circumstances, in our view, the trial
    judge made no error in considering the Proposal.  In any event, even if the Proposal were
    inadmissible, the trial judge gave other reasons for her interpretation of

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see nothing in relation to the costs award that
    warrants granting leave.  Ms. Condoyannis
    succeeded at trial and was presumptively entitled to costs.  It is trite law that deference is owed to the
    trial judge on the matter of quantum, absent some error in principle.  We see no such error.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to Ms.
    Condoyannis, fixed in the amount of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and
    GST.  Mr. Foundos and Mr. Lightman are
    jointly and severally liable for the costs.  Such costs are payable forthwith from the funds being held in trust for
    Mr. Foundos by Delzotto Zorzi LLP.    </p>
