  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two principal issues on this appeal: first,
    whether the trial judge erred in dismissing a claim of misfeasance in public
    office against the respondents, the City of Hamilton and the Regional
    Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth; and second, whether he erred in making a
    very large costs award – in excess of $4 million – in favour of the
    respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, St. Elizabeth Home Society (Hamilton,
    Ontario), operates a retirement home in Hamilton called the St. Elizabeth
    Villa.  The Villa is licensed under a
    City of Hamilton by-law as a “second level lodging house” – that is, a home for
    “persons requiring guidance with the activities of daily living”.  Over the period relevant to this litigation,
    the Villa was run by two Sisters – Sister Maria Szucs and Sister Elisabeth
    Manhertz.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early 1994, the former Director of Nursing at the
    Villa, Helen Demchuk, and several healthcare aides sent letters (collectively,
    the Demchuk letters) to the Region’s Public Health Department, the City’s
    Licensing Department and the Villa’s Board of Directors alleging wide-spread
    substandard care of residents at the Villa.  These letters prompted a review of the Villa’s practices by an
    independent consultant, Martha McGuire, retained by the Villa’s Board.  In early December 2004, after a two-week
    review, Ms. McGuire delivered a draft report.  The report was damning.   It amplified the concerns in the Demchuk
    letters, strongly criticized many health care practices at the Villa and
    commented adversely on the autocratic management style of Sister Maria.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a meeting on December 12, 1994, Ms. McGuire reviewed
    her draft report with the Sisters.  They
    were upset with its content and objected to many of its criticisms.  Overall, they did not accept the report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 20, 1994, eight days after the meeting, the
    City and the Region issued an order to comply against the Villa.  The order to comply lies at the heart of this
    appeal.  It alleged that the Villa had
    violated the “second level lodging house” by-law in four areas: admission of
    residents, nursing care, reports and records, and food.  Over the next several months, the Villa took
    steps to rectify the violations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 1995, a Hamilton City councillor, Mr. Merling,
    leaked the order to comply and other documents to a reporter at the local
    paper, the Hamilton Spectator.  Over the
    next six months, the Spectator published many articles on the Villa.  Three of the articles referred to the order
    to comply.  At the time, St. Elizabeth
    took no action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 1996 and early 1997, the coroner held an
    inquest into the deaths of five Villa residents.  The Spectator reported the inquest’s evidence
    daily for six weeks with flashy headlines and dramatic stories.  In late December 1996, in the middle of the
    inquest, St. Elizabeth began this litigation.  Still, it made no claim that the order to comply was defamatory.  In 2001, however, St. Elizabeth amended its
    statement of claim to allege defamation, abuse of public office, abuse of
    power, negligence, interference with economic relations and conspiracy, all in
    connection with the order to comply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action was tried before Crane J. over 142 days
    between April 2004 and July 2005.  In a
    lengthy judgment delivered in December 2005, the trial judge dismissed the
    action in its entirety.  He assessed St.
    Elizabeth’s damages at $102,185.  And he
    awarded costs of $2,317,000 to the City and $1,945,000 to the Region – a total
    of $4,262,000 – even though, by legislation effective January 1, 2001, the City
    and the Region had been amalgamated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, St. Elizabeth makes a wide-ranging attack on
    the trial judgment, contending that the trial judge made palpable and overriding
    errors in his findings of fact, and that he erred in law, particularly in his
    application of the tests for misfeasance in public office and negligence by a
    public authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St. Elizabeth also contends that the trial judge erred
    in finding that the Region was entitled to rely on the six-month limitation
    period in the <i>Public Authorities
    Protection Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38, even though a municipality is
    expressly excluded from the Act.  In addition,
    St. Elizabeth argues that the trial judge erred both in failing to find a
    causal relationship between the respondents’ misconduct and St. Elizabeth’s
    losses and in his calculation of damages for lost profits.  Finally, St. Elizabeth seeks leave to appeal,
    and if granted appeals the costs award on the grounds that it is too high and
    that separate awards to the City and the Region were unwarranted after they
    were amalgamated in 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St. Elizabeth seeks an order allowing the appeal, and a
    judgment in the amount of $715,295 for lost profits and $200,000 in general
    damages, plus prejudgment interest and costs.  </p>
  <h4><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    begin by observing that St. Elizabeth’s claim lacks an air reality.  Its claim now centres on the order to comply
    issued in December 1994.  Yet, although
    the Sisters forcefully disagreed with the order, the Villa did not initially seek
    to appeal or review it, or challenge it in any way.  Instead, the Villa sought to address the
    violations in the order and, from the record, seemed to have done so quite
    successfully.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
    after the order to comply was leaked to the press and referred to in several
    Hamilton Spectator articles in 1995, St. Elizabeth initially made no claim in
    respect of it.  Indeed, even in late 1996
    when St. Elizabeth began this lawsuit, the order to comply figured only
    marginally in its pleadings.  Not until 2001
    – seven years after the order to comply was issued and five years after the
    lawsuit against the City and the Region was started – did St. Elizabeth amend
    its statement of claim and shift its focus to challenging the order to comply.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
    the challenge to the order to comply was belated is not fatal to its
    success.  But it does give context to the
    question whether the issuance of the order to comply seriously affected the
    operation of the Villa.  That context
    would have been apparent to the trial judge as the evidence unfolded before
    him.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>St.
    Elizabeth argued six issues before us: misfeasance in public office, the

lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    did not call on the City and the Region to respond to St. Elizabeth’s
    submission on negligence.  St. Elizabeth
    submitted that the respondents were negligent in their investigation of the
    Villa and in issuing the order to comply.  In our view, that submission must fail because neither respondent owed a
    duty of care to the Villa.  In their
    investigation and in issuing the order to comply, the respondents owed a public
    law duty to the residents of the Villa; they owed no duty to the Villa’s
    operator: see, for example, <i>River Valley
    Poultry Farm Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2009), 95 O.R. (3d) 1
    (C.A.).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
    of our conclusion on the absence of a duty of care, we need not address the two
    related questions of merger and the <i>Public
    Authorities Protection Act</i>.  St.
    Elizabeth argued before the trial judge, as it argued before us, that it could
    maintain a claim in negligence separate from its claim of defamation.  The trial judge held, however, that St.
    Elizabeth’s negligence claim merged with its claim for defamation arising out
    of the Hamilton Spectator articles in 1995 and a later Globe and Mail article
    in mid-1996.  As the defamation action
    failed because St. Elizabeth did not meet the notice and limitation provisions
    in the <i>Libel and Slander Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. L.12, so too did the negligence action.  We express no opinion on whether the trial
    judge correctly applied the doctrine of merger.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
    we express no opinion on whether the trial judge was correct in concluding that
    any negligence claims against the Region and its Public Health Department were
    statute-barred because St. Elizabeth did not sue within the six-month
    limitation period in the <i>Public
    Authorities Protection Act</i>.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> We called on the respondents to address
    misfeasance in public office, causation, damages and costs.  The balance of these reasons, however, deals
    only with the issues of misfeasance in public office and costs.  We are not persuaded that the trial judge
    erred in dismissing the claim for misfeasance in public office, thus rendering
    a discussion of causation and damages unnecessary.  However, we are persuaded that the trial
    judge erred in his costs award.  We would
    grant leave to appeal from that part of his judgment, allow the appeal on costs
    and substantially reduce those costs in accordance with these reasons.  </span></p>

    its core, the tort targets officials who act dishonestly or in bad faith.  As Iacobucci J. said in <i>Odhavji</i>, public officials who deliberately engage in conduct that
    they know to be inconsistent with the obligations of their office risk
    liability for the tort.  Conversely,
    public officials who honestly believe their acts are lawful, and do not intend
    to cause harm or know that harm would likely result from their actions, fall
    outside the ambit of misfeasance in public office.  In this way, the required mental element
    achieves a balance between curbing unlawful, dishonest behavior and enabling
    public officials to do their jobs free from claims by those adversely affected
    by their decisions.  </span></p>

    order to comply the Villa had not violated the licensing by-law.  St. Elizabeth contends that, by issuing the
    order to comply, City and Region officials acted with reckless disregard <span

    discussing in detail the licensing by-law and the order to comply, we will set
    out the trial judge’s findings on misfeasance in public office.  We address only the first two elements of the
    tort, which are the elements that make it an intentional tort.  The trial judge found that St. Elizabeth had
    failed to establish either of these elements.  On the first element – deliberate unlawful conduct in the exercise of
    public functions – the trial judge concluded at para. 408:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    conclude that the representatives Hunter, Barrow, Nelson and Schofield, did
    have the authority to issue the Order to Comply.  I find secondly, that their belief in their
    authority was reasonably held by each of them on the basis that the
    interpretation given to the By-law by them was one that the By-law could
    bear.  I find that there was no intention
    by these parties to act beyond their powers and thereby abuse their authority.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the second element – awareness that the conduct is unlawful and likely to harm
    St. Elizabeth – the trial judge concluded at para. 392:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    second essential element of the defendants being aware that their conduct of
    issuing the Order to Comply was likely to cause harm to the Villa, has no
    factual foundation.  There is no credible
    evidence that any of the defendants were “aware both that his or her conduct
    was unlawful and that it was likely to harm the plaintiff”.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>And at 408:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Nor
    was there any knowledge by any of them that the issuance of the Order to Comply
    would do anything other than benefit the plaintiff in improving health care to
    the Villa residents.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    a separate section of his reasons, the trial judge addressed the issue of good
    faith.  He found that the several public
    officials from the Region’s Department of Public Health who dealt with the
    Villa acted in good faith.  They believed
    that they were acting lawfully when they issued the order to comply.  Their intent in doing so was not to harm the
    Villa but to assist it in its operation.  The trial judge found that the City’s licence inspector, Dean Barrow,
    was a “consummate civil servant” who did not have “either a torch to bear or a
    sword to wield”. </span></p>
  <h3>(b)     City
    of Hamilton licensing by-law 80-259</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This by-law prescribes standards for licensing and
    regulating second level lodging houses.  The Villa was licensed under this by-law in 1988.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1(25) of the by-law defines a second level
    lodging house:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1(25) “Second Level Lodging House” means a House:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        which accommodates four or
    more Residents;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       where, for a fee, the Operator
    offers to Residents guidance in the activities of daily living; and advice and
    information;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)     <span
class=GramE>where</span>, 24 hours a day, at least the Operator or one adult
    employee of the Operator, in on duty in the House and able to furnish such
    guidance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1(1) defines “activities of daily living” as including
    “those activities of the individual that maintain his sufficient nutrition,
    hygiene, warmth and rest.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The regulatory provisions of the by-law that the Villa
    allegedly violated are found in ss. 26, 32, 35 and 44(2).  Section 26 deals with the admission of
    residents to a second level lodging house:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ADMISSION OF RESIDENTS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>26.       Where the physical or mental condition of
    a person is such that, in the opinion of a physician, the person cannot be
    properly cared for in a House, the person shall not be admitted or remain as a
    Resident.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Section 26 must be considered in conjunction with the
    undertaking signed by the two Sisters when the Villa was licensed in 1988:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Let this serve to certify and confirm that,
    effective the 25th day of August, 1988, no person(s) will be admitted to the
    St. Elizabeth Villa in the absence of a certificate from a legally qualified
    medical practitioner certifying that such person(s) does not require Nursing
    Home Care, at the time of admission, in the opinion of such medical practitioner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 32 of the by-law deals with nursing care:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>NURSING CARE</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>32.       Wherever the physician mentioned in
    sections 30 or 31 determines that a Resident requires emergency nursing care of
    “Home Care Services”, the Operator shall allow such nursing care or “Home Care
    Services” to be given to that Resident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 35 deals with food:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>NUTRITIONAL CARE</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>35.       The Operator shall ensure that the
    Residents are served daily sufficient food of good quality and adequate
    nutritional and caloric value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And s. 44(2) deals with the reporting of assaults or
    injuries:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>RECORDS AND REPORTS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>44(2)  <span class=GramE>Every</span> occurrence of
    fire, assault and injury shall be recorded forthwith and kept available for
    inspection by the Medical Officer of Health.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During argument, the parties put forward two different
    theories about what prompted Public Health Officials to issue the order to
    comply.  According to St. Elizabeth, in
    targeting the Villa, the Public Health Department of the Region was advancing
    its hidden agenda to implement a set of recommendations for interpreting and
    indeed changing the by-law, even though the City had refused to amend it.  The Public Health Department and the task
    force that made these recommendations wanted a more comprehensive regulation of
    second level lodging houses, and specifically wanted to exclude those persons
    eligible for admission at provincially regulated nursing homes.  St. Elizabeth claimed that the Public Health
    Department sought to make an example of the Villa in order to press its case
    for amending the by-law.  The trial judge
    rejected St. Elizabeth’s claim at para. 514 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I reject the plaintiff’s submission as unfounded
    that Ms. Schofield and Public Health were on a mission or had a well-meaning
    intention to enforce a higher level of health care on operators of Second Level
    Lodging Houses than was provided in By-law 80-259 and 81-93.  I find that Ms. Schofield had accepted that
    the Provincial Government did not accept the Christopherson Task Force
    recommendations and that it was for her to move on and do her job.  I expect that a conscientious Medical Officer
    of Health and her Public Health staff would interpret their legislative
    authority broadly, consistent with obtaining for the vulnerable elderly
    population in Second Level Lodging Homes, a good level of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis to overturn that finding.  Moreover, we do not see it as terribly
    relevant to the issue we must decide: whether the trial judge’s finding that
    the respondents did not knowingly abuse their authority when they issued the
    order to comply ought to be overturned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other theory, pressed by the respondents, was that
    in reality St. Elizabeth was not operating a second level lodging house, but instead
    an unlicensed nursing home.  According to
    the City and the Region, far too many residents were admitted to the Villa who
    should have been in a nursing home.  The
    trial judge agreed with the respondents’ contention at para. 466 of his
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude from all the evidence that the Sisters
    did not profess any intention of operating the Villa according to the Second
    Level Lodging House By-law of guidance in daily living.  They had operated a nursing home on John
    Street and I find that they had set up the Villa to care for essentially the
    same care level of persons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion becomes relevant when we
    examine whether St. Elizabeth violated s. 26 of the by-law and the Sisters’
    undertaking concerning the admission of residents to the Villa.</p>
  <h3>(c)       The
    order to comply</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the order to comply was issued on
    December 20, <span class=GramE>1994,</span> eight days after the Sisters had
    reviewed McGuire’s draft report.  St.
    Elizabeth submits that in issuing the order and issuing it when they did, the
    City and the Region acted in bad faith.  St. Elizabeth argues that instead of issuing a formal order, the
    representatives of the respondents should have met informally with the Sisters
    and the Villa’s Board of Directors to discuss their concerns.  St. Elizabeth also argues that the
    respondents acted precipitously in issuing the order before receiving McGuire’s
    final report and before giving the Villa’s Board an opportunity to discuss the
    report at its January meeting.  We do not
    agree with St. Elizabeth’s submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Demchuk letters and the McGuire draft report
    presented an alarming yet credible portrayal of substandard care at the
    Villa.  Demchuk was the former Director
    of Nursing.  She was in a position to
    know.  McGuire was an independent
    consultant who spent two weeks examining resident care at the Villa.  Demchuk wrote of feeding several residents
    from the same food, placing residents in restraints for night sleep, and
    physical and verbal abuse of residents by staff.  McGuire’s draft report wrote about food being
    recycled, inappropriate emergency procedures, lack of ready access to food and
    drink, rough and disrespectful treatment of residents, poor hygienic practices,
    overuse of restraints and the Sisters’ highly controlling management
    style.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faced with the serious concerns raised by Demchuk and
    McGuire, the respondents had a duty to protect the health and safety of the
    residents at the Villa.  They had to take
    some action.  They were not obliged to
    wait until McGuire’s final report or the January Board meeting.  Indeed, they would have been open to
    criticism had they done so as the Sisters had already rejected, in strong
    terms, the content of the Demchuk letters and the McGuire draft report as “biased”
    and “unfounded” .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the seriousness of the concerns about
    resident care at the Villa, coupled with the Sisters’ categorical refusal to
    acknowledge these concerns, demanded formal action, not a mere informal
    discussion.  The respondents could have
    taken more serious action – for example, a charge under the by-law or a show
    cause hearing to revoke or suspend St. Elizabeth’s license – but instead chose
    the least drastic formal option available: the issuance of an order to
    comply.  Viewed in this light, their
    exercise of discretion to take formal action instead of holding an informal
    meeting can hardly be characterized as evidence of bad faith.  Indeed, the trial judge found that in issuing
    the order to comply, they were motivated by good faith and a desire to assist
    the Villa and its residents.  The record
    fully supports his finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order to comply is directed to Sister Maria and the
    Villa.  It begins with a recital “that in
    accordance with the City of Hamilton by-law 80-259 as amended an inspection was
    conducted and the following violations were noted”.  The order to comply goes on to state that a
    by-law charge may be laid if the Villa fails to comply with the order’s terms
    within 42 days.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The substantive part of the order deatils the alleged
    violations along with recommendations for compliance and implementation
    dates.  We set these out in full:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St. Elizabeth makes two main submissions regarding the
    order to comply: first, that no inspection under the by-law was conducted; and
    second, that the Villa did not commit the infractions alleged.  St. Elizabeth says that the respondents knew
    that no inspection had been carried out and knew that no violation had been
    committed, and yet, with reckless disregard, went ahead and issued the order to
    comply.  We do not accept St. Elizabeth’s
    submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the by-law, “inspector” is defined to mean, among
    other things, “an Inspector of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Board of
    Health”.  We accept that McGuire was not
    an inspector under the by-law and that her report largely prompted the issuing
    of the order to comply.  In a narrow,
    literal sense, St. Elizabeth is correct that there was no “inspection” under
    the by-law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Region’s Department of Public Health
    officials inspected the Villa regularly and did so as late as mid-November 1994.  They had access to both the Demchuk letters
    and the McGuire draft report.  These
    public health officials took a broad view of what constituted an “inspection”
    and were satisfied that this pre-condition to the issuance of an order to
    comply had been met.  We think that they
    acted reasonably in doing so.  In
    performing their public functions, they were entitled to act on reliable
    information and reports obtained in the course of their duties.  </p>
  <h3>(d)       The alleged violations</h3>
  <h3>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 26: Admission of Residents</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most serious alleged violation is that residents
    beyond the level of care of a second level lodging house were admitted to the
    Villa, contrary to s. 26 of the by-law.  McGuire’s draft report provided compelling evidence that the Sisters
    were admitting many residents who should have been in a nursing home.  She noted that nearly half the residents of
    the Villa (47 of 98) had care requirements that exceeded the care to be
    provided in a second level lodging house.  Some approached a state of total dependency.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 26 itself prescribes that where, in the opinion
    of a physician, a person cannot be properly cared for in a second level lodging
    house, the person shall not be admitted or remain a resident.  As we have said, s. 26 has to be considered
    in conjunction with the undertaking given by the Sisters that no person would
    be admitted to the Villa without a certificate from a legally qualified medical
    practitioner certifying that at the time of admission the person did not
    require nursing home care.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St. Elizabeth points out that every admission to the
    Villa was accompanied by a doctor’s certificate signed either by Dr. Szabo or
    Dr. Magda, in accordance with the undertaking and s. 26.  However, these certificates are not conclusive
    proof of compliance with the undertaking and the by-law.  For the certificates to be valid and
    compliant, the doctors’ opinions must be informed opinions.  The opinions would be informed only if the
    doctors understood their obligations under the by-law and the undertaking, and
    understood the difference between a second level lodging house and a nursing
    home.  The trial judge found that they
    did not.  At para. 427 of his reasons, he
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have found from the evidence that these
    physicians were involved in miscommunication and non-communication, perhaps,
    most importantly, with regard to the requirements of the City’s Second Level
    Lodging House By-law as it related to the care provided at the Villa.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span class=GramE>And at para.</span> 430:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The certificates that the doctors signed following
    admission of their new patients to the Villa, were in a standard printed form
    prepared by the Villa.  I find these
    forms did not correctly reflect the opinions of the doctors.  Indeed, neither Doctor Magda nor Doctor <span
class=GramE>Szabo,</span> considered the distinctions between nursing homes and
    second level lodging houses.  As indicated,
    their only concern was whether there was adequate care for their patients at
    the Villa.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span class=GramE>And finally at paras.</span> 464-465:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. Nelson’s evidence is that she found the
    residents’ doctors were not aware of the level of services regulated under a
    Second Level Lodging house By-Law as compared to the Provincial standards of
    nursing homes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This impression of Ms. Nelson proved to be largely
    true.  Each of Drs. Magda and Szabo, in
    my understanding of their evidence, assessed their patients as to whether they
    believed the Villa could properly care for them.  Neither thought it relevant to his practice
    to understand the licensing distinction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the two doctors who signed the
    certificates supports these findings.  For example, Dr. Szabo acknowledged that he did not really understand
    the by-law:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        That is not true.  I believe I may have had some discussion with
    the visiting nurses who came for inspections and job reviews and what have you
    on a regular basis.  And I may have told
    them that I didn’t completely understand the by-law, that I didn’t understand
    what it was all about.  They may have
    interpreted that to mean that I didn’t know about the by-law.  There’s a difference</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Well, sure.  I mean, if you’ve said to the public health
    officials …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Because …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        ‘I know there’s a by-law but I don’t
    understand the by-law.’  Do you think you
    might have said something like that, is that <span class=GramE>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        I would have said it’s vague, it’s very
    difficult to interpret and so therefore – but again, I’m not sure it was Ms. <span
class=GramE>Schofield,</span> I did see some of the nurses that visited on a
    regular basis.  I didn’t see <span
class=GramE>them,</span> I saw them in the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Magda admitted that he did not review the by-law
    until the inquest was called in 1996:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Do you recall ever having reviewed this
    by-law which governs second-level lodging homes?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        I
    did review it, but not at that time.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Yes.  And you reviewed it prior to the inquest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Did
    you review it before that time?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        I
    don’t think I remember doing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also apparent that, in certifying admissions to
    the Villa, Dr. Magda did not take account of the Sisters’ undertaking that the
    person admitted did not require nursing home care.  His only concern was that the Villa be able
    to provide the residents with the necessary care, even if it was the type of
    care provided by a nursing home.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Can you tell me what kind of
    considerations you looked to in 1994 in making the assessment as to whether or
    not one of your patients was suitable for admission to the villa?</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But perhaps the most concrete evidence that the Sisters
    were operating a nursing home at the Villa came from the City’s official, Dean
    Barrow.  After a visit to the Villa, he
    testified about what he saw and about what he expected to see:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Every floor that I attended [he attended on all
    floors] there was no one … all the lights were out in the bedrooms, the doors
    were open, it was dark.  There was no one
    in the halls.  On each floor that we went
    to, with the exception of the 6<sup>th</sup> floor, we did not see – other than
    employees, we did not see any clients until we arrived at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor when I observed there were six elderly clients or lodgers sitting in
    wheelchairs. ... I was a bit uneasy.  I
    thought I was disturbing the clients here.  I thought I was in – I thought I was in a nursing home.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This was a licensed second level lodging home that
    had in excess, at the time, of 100 clients.  I expected, because it was such a large facility and had been in similar
    facilities, not in Hamilton, that it’d be quite busy, that they had a
    recreational room there with TV and lounges.  I expected people would be, you know, sitting there watching TV, maybe
    playing cards, talking, having family visit – having family visiting them at
    that time of night.  This was 7:30.  We saw no one.  The only person we saw when we entered was
    Sister Maria.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cumulatively, this evidence shows that, at least in
    substance, the Villa had violated s. 26 of the by-law and the undertaking.  </p>
  <h3><span>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    32: Nursing Care </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order to comply alleged two violations connected to
    nursing care: responses to medical emergencies were delayed and additional care
    was not provided to 45 residents who needed more care than ordinarily provided
    in a second level lodging house.  Section
    32 of the by-law stipulates that when an on-call physician determines that a
    resident requires emergency nursing care or additional care, the Villa has to
    allow that care to be given.  Admittedly,
    the two alleged violations do not fit easily into s. 32, which conditions
    emergency and additional care on a doctor’s opinion. Nonetheless, the record
    substantiates that City officials had good reason to be concerned about these
    problems at the Villa.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Health care workers at the Villa testified that Sister
    Maria prohibited them from calling 9-1-1 in case of a medical emergency.  Sister Maria’s protocol required first reporting
    the incident to her or to another designated staff person.  This protocol is entirely consistent with the
    McGuire draft report’s observations regarding Sister Maria’s controlling
    management style.  Of course, for
    residents in crisis, this protocol could have tragic consequences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the Region’s Public Health Department, 45
    residents in need of additional care at the Villa were not receiving it.  In the face of this evidence, Public Health
    officials can hardly be criticized for requiring that these nursing care
    problems be rectified.  Their actions
    were consistent with the obligations of their office: protecting the health and
    safety of the residents of the Villa.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 44(2) requires that every occurrence of a fire,
    assault or injury be recorded and that the report be available for inspection
    by the medical officer of health.  The
    order to comply alleged that records were not being kept for every
    occurrence.  The evidence of Rachelle
    Harber, whom the trial judge found “to be a knowledgeable and dedicated Public Health
    nurse with very positive motives”, supported this allegation.  She testified that occurrence reports for
    serious injuries at the Villa were not completed.  She was not shaken in her evidence on
    cross-examination.</p>
  <h3><span>(iv)</span> <span>     </span>Section
    35: Recycling of Food</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order to comply alleged that food was being
    recycled at the Villa contrary to s. 35 of the by-law, which requires that the
    operator serve food “of good quality”.  This allegation was especially concerning in an elderly and vulnerable
    population, many of whom could not protect <span class=GramE>themselves</span> from disease.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although no one from the City or the Region saw food
    being recycled, Mr. Hunter – the Director of the Environmental Health Branch at
    the Region’s Department of Public Health and the person who drafted s. 35 – testified
    that inspectors seldom, if ever, directly observe poor health care
    practices.  They have to rely on evidence
    from others.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In including s. 35 in the order to comply, Mr. Hunter
    relied on evidence in the Demchuk letters.  In our view, he was entitled to do so.  Those letters were written by health care workers at the Villa who saw
    food being recycled and reused – from one meal to the next and from one
    resident to the next – mainly by, and under the direction of, Sister
    Elizabeth.  The trial judge referred to
    some of this evidence at para. 525 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the Teles letter, concerns were expressed of
    food being recycled and mould being scraped off food and the remaining food fed
    to residents; that Sister Elisabeth used her hands to serve food (resulting in
    a concern for cross-contamination and disease); that cereal was
    recirculated.   The concern regarding the
    cereal was that the first resident using her spoon would, if carrying a
    contagious disease, contaminate the cereal with that disease for the second
    resident to ingest.  Food being recycled,
    such as toast served to residents with bites taken from it, again, could spread
    bacteria between residents.  The use of
    food containing mould may cause illness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hunter also had available to him the inspection
    report of Rachelle Harber, a public health nurse for the Region.  In her inspection of the Villa in
    mid-November 1994, she noted that one resident told her “she watched Sister
    Elizabeth use leftover food from one resident and give it to another resident”,
    apparently because “the resident ate too <span class=GramE>slow</span>.”  Overall, substantial, credible evidence
    supported the allegation of food recycling.</p>
  <h3>(e)       Conclusion on misfeasance in public
    office</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>   </span>The tort of misfeasance in public
    office requires unlawful activity that is carried out deliberately with
    knowledge that it is likely to harm the plaintiff.  In our view, the respondents acted lawfully
    in issuing the order to comply.  They put
    forward substantial and credible evidence to support their claim that the Villa
    had violated three provisions of the by-law – ss. 26, 35 and 44(2).  And, although the evidence did not establish
    that the Villa had violated the express terms of s. 32 of the by-law, the
    evidence did support the two allegations concerning nursing care at the Villa
    identified in the order to comply.  Overall, we are not persuaded that St. Elizabeth has demonstrated
    illegality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even if we were to conclude that the
    respondents acted unlawfully in issuing the order, St. Elizabeth has failed to
    make out the critically important mental element of the tort.  In our view, the trial judge’s finding that
    the respondents acted honestly, believing their actions to be lawful, and
    without any intent to harm the Villa is borne out by the evidence and by his
    credibility findings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In asserting that the respondents knew that they had no
    authority to issue the order to comply and acted with reckless disregard to the
    harm the order might cause to the Villa, St. Elizabeth points to the evidence
    of some of the Region’s Public Health officials and to the pre-trial evidence
    of David Beck, the Region’s solicitor who advised the Public Health Department
    to issue the order to comply.  We do not
    think that their evidence undermines the trial judge’s finding that the
    respondents honestly believed they had the authority to issue the order to
    comply and that they acted in good faith in doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ruth Schofield, an experienced nurse responsible for
    administrating the second level lodging house program, and Vicky Woodcox, a
    Director of Nursing for the Region’s Public Health Department, were
    cross-examined extensively on whether the Villa had violated s. 32 of the
    by-law.  Both conceded that the Villa had
    not violated s. 32 as it was written because of the absence of an on-call
    doctor’s opinion.  But both maintained
    that the Villa had violated the intent of s. 32: to provide immediate emergency
    care or additional care when needed.  We
    do not find that their concession, which was limited to the express wording of
    s. 32, evidences bad faith.  Indeed, the
    evidence seems to support the view of Ms. Schofield and Ms. Woodcox that the
    Villa frustrated the purpose of s. 32 because no one at the Villa – and especially
    not the Sisters – informed the on-call doctors of the need for emergency care
    or additional care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David Beck was examined exhaustively before trial but
    was not called as a witness at the trial.  St. Elizabeth submits that in his pre-trial evidence, Beck acknowledged
    that at the December 14, 1994 meeting when the decision was made to issue the
    order to comply, he told City and Region officials that “there was no legal
    violation of the by-law”.  Moreover, St.
    Elizabeth says that we should draw an adverse inference against the respondents
    because the Region failed to call Beck as a witness at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To take the last point first, we see no basis to draw
    an adverse inference.  It was open to St.
    Elizabeth to call Beck as a witness, and it had available Beck’s extensive
    pre-trial evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On St. Elizabeth’s first point, we do not read Beck’s
    pre-trial evidence to say that he gave the opinion no legal violation of the
    by-law had occurred.  Indeed, the order
    to comply was issued on his advice.  Mr.
    Barrow testified that Mr. Beck directed him to draft the order because the Region’s
    Public Health officials concluded that the Villa had violated the by-law.  Ms. Schofield testified that what Beck
    cautioned against was laying a charge under the by-law, but that Beck said an
    order to comply was appropriate if the by-law had been violated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I can’t remember exactly the wording that he said
    but I do remember, overall, what he said.  I do recall that that was, overall, what he was saying, that it was a
    violation of the By-law and – but we were not laying a charge.  This was a violation of the areas that have
    been identified with these different standards. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I said, my understanding was that’s
    correct.  We were not going to lay a
    charge.  With the information we couldn’t
    lay a charge because we hadn’t gone through the enforcement process but that
    doesn’t mean we couldn’t give a violation and that was my understanding, that
    there was a violation and that they could have an Order to Comply.   That was my understanding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, are not persuaded that the evidence of
    Ms. Schofield, Ms. Woodcox or Mr. Beck supports St. Elizabeth’s submission that
    the respondents knowingly acted unlawfully in issuing the order to comply.  On the contrary, the record amply
    demonstrates that the City and Region officials dealing with the Villa acted
    honestly and in good faith in issuing the order to comply.  The trial judge made that finding and he made
    no error in doing so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in our view, St. Elizabeth has failed to
    show that the respondents acted unlawfully in issuing the order to comply.  It has also failed to show that the
    respondents acted dishonestly or that they knew their actions would likely harm
    the Villa.  St. Elizabeth’s challenge to
    the trial judge’s dismissal of the claim for misfeasance in public office must
    fail.  </p>

    respondents maintain that St. Elizabeth is precluded from challenging the trial
    judge’s decision to award two completely separate sets of costs.  The respondents argue that, in the course of
    its costs submissions at trial, St. Elizabeth had conceded that both the Region
    and the City were entitled to costs as if the amalgamation had not occurred. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    our view, the respondents have misinterpreted the concession made by St.
    Elizabeth.  Clearly, both the Region and
    the City were entitled to separate awards of costs up until the date of
    amalgamation.  Nothing in the record
    suggests that St. Elizabeth’s concession was intended to apply beyond this to
    the post-amalgamation period.  Indeed,
    the portion of St. Elizabeth’s submissions at trial dealing with the
    appropriate quantum of costs clearly said that, after the amalgamation, the
    respondents were no longer entitled to an award that ignored the fact the City

    one interest to be defended and the cross-claim between them became a
    nullity.  The trial judge therefore erred
    when he stated that “there was distinct and separate interest and exposure to
    liability as between [the City] and [the Region].”  It is true that different strategies, relying
    on the various actions of the Region or the City, were available to St.
    Elizabeth in seeking to establish the liability of the amalgamated City of
    Hamilton.  However, whichever strategy
    was adopted, and regardless of who is said to have been responsible for the
    negligence or misfeasance, the same entity – the amalgamated City of Hamilton –
    would be liable.  </span></p>

    insurers, continued separate representation after amalgamation was warranted.  We would not give effect to this

    an insurer and a re-insurer, involved in defending a claim against an insured,
    each of whom may have its own set of lawyers advising it.  However, this does not normally result in the
    plaintiff being burdened with more than one set of costs.</span></p>

    individuals did not have separate representation before amalgamation.  They were represented by counsel for the Region,
    their employer at the time.  The Region’s
    by-laws provided that it would indemnify them from claims such as the one
    advanced in this litigation.  After
    amalgamation, they continued to be indemnified by their employer and continued
    to share the same solicitor as their employer.  On the facts of this case, we see no basis to justify separate
    representation for these two individuals after amalgamation.  Although they may have developed a good
    working relationship with counsel for the Region, and may have preferred to
    continue working with them, this does not justify imposing costs for two sets
    of lawyers to represent interests that were only notionally different after

    when the claim was issued there were two separate defendants – the City and the
    Region – defending.  Therefore, up to the
    point of amalgamation, each was entitled to its own set of lawyers as each
    faced different issues, provided separate instructions, had different
    priorities and faced separate liability.  After the amalgamation, the need for separate representation was
    lost.  However, it would be unrealistic
    to expect the amalgamated City of Hamilton to have chosen one of the two
    previous law firms and immediately dismissed the other without further

    that, although he considered the offers to settle as one factor among many,
    they were not determinative.  Second, in
    any event, the respondents say that the offers to settle did provide an
    appropriate basis for the award.  Finally, the respondents say that the award was justified by St.

    to the respondents’ second submission, the respondents argue that the trial
    judge was correct to rely on the offers to settle to award substantial
    indemnity costs.  The trial judge explained
    that the offers to settle justified the award because the plaintiff’s offer was
    “unjustifiable and unacceptable to the defendants”, “exceeded its expert
    evidence on assessment of damages at trial” and “put the defendants in the
    situation of either paying an outrageously large sum as settlement or incurring
    an outrageously large sum to successfully defend <span class=GramE>themselves</span>.”  By contrast, the trial judge found that the
    respondents “made an offer that represented a generous resolution of the
    litigation in favour of the plaintiff … they acted responsibly to avoid a huge
    trial cost.”  He then concluded that “the
    defendants’ offer to settle must be positively recognized both to do justice
    here and as a precedent to the parties and their counsel in other litigation by
    ‘deep pocketed’ plaintiffs.”  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondents submit that authority for the trial judge’s reliance on the offers
    to settle in setting costs can be found in this court’s decision in <i>S &amp; A Strasser v. Richmond Hill (Town)</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 243 (C.A.).  In that
    case, the Court of Appeal determined that awarding substantial indemnity costs
    from the date of a defendant’s offer to settle was justified.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rule
    49 sets out the costs consequences of offers to settle.  Pursuant to r. 49.10(1), where a plaintiff
    offers to settle, obtains a judgment at least as favourable as the offer to
    settle, and meets other procedural requirements, it is entitled to substantial
    indemnity costs from the date of the offer unless a court orders
    otherwise.  However, there is no
    corresponding provision entitling a defendant to substantial indemnity costs
    where it makes an offer to settle that is greater than the amount ultimately
    awarded.  Nor is there any provision
    providing that substantial indemnity costs can be awarded against a plaintiff
    where its offer to settle is inordinately high.   In our view, therefore, the trial judge
    erred in relying on the offers to settle for his award of substantial indemnity
    costs.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
    we reject the respondent’s submission that the trial judge’s consideration of
    the defendants’ offer was justified on the basis of this court’s decision in <i>Strasser </i>to award substantial indemnity
    costs against a plaintiff where the defendant had made a reasonable offer to
    settle.  In that case, the trial judge had
    observed that the situation “screams for solicitor and client costs.”    </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    later decisions of our court have stressed that <i>Strasser</i> should be applied narrowly.  In <i>Davies
    v. Clarington (Municipality)</i> (2009), 312 D.L.R. (4th) 278 (Ont. C.A.), this
    court carefully reviewed the jurisprudence since <i>Strasser</i> and concluded, at para. 40, that <i>Strasser</i> should be interpreted as “a case where the trial judge
    implicitly found such egregious behavior” on the part of the plaintiff that an
    award of substantial indemnity costs was warranted.  It does not, as the respondents suggest,
    represent a change in the law that solicitor and client costs are only awarded
    in rare and exceptional cases.  (See also <i>Scapillati v. A. Potvin Construction
    Limited</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.) and <i>McBride Metal Fabricating Corp. v. H. &amp; W. Sales Co.</i> (2002), 59

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
    to the plaintiff’s offer, the trial judge’s comments suggest that a plaintiff
    making a settlement offer prior to trial will be penalized in costs if the
    offer proves to be high as compared to the evidence led at trial.  As noted, rule 49 does not provide for this.  Furthermore, such an approach would operate
    to discourage plaintiffs from making offers to settle unless they were
    reasonably confident that the amount offered was less than what they would
    ultimately be seeking to prove at trial.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge’s finding that St. Elizabeth’s offer to settle put the respondents
    in the position of either settling for an inordinately high amount or incurring
    the costs of litigation is not a relevant consideration in awarding substantial
    indemnity costs.  The existence of a
    large gap between a plaintiff’s and a defendant’s offer provides only a limited
    indication whether a figure between the two might resolve the matter prior to
    trial.  The widely divergent offers in
    this case put the respondents in no worse a position than defendants in the
    many cases where the plaintiff makes a large claim, neither party makes a
    settlement offer and the plaintiff’s claim ultimately fails at trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    we note that St. Elizabeth’s claim advanced at trial was more than the amount
    it offered to settle for.  Although St.
    Elizabeth’s settlement offer exceeded its own expert’s assessment of damages,
    the expert only addressed the lost revenue claim.  St. Elizabeth was also advancing a claim for
    general, punitive and exemplary damages.  When these claims are added to the expert’s assessment of damages, it
    brings the total claim well beyond the amount of the settlement proposal.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Could
    the award be justified by St. Elizabeth’s conduct of the action?</span></h3>

    turn now to the respondents’ submission that the award of substantial indemnity
    costs was, or could be, justified by St. Elizabeth’s conduct of the
    action.  Although the trial judge
    expressed concern with the way St. Elizabeth conducted the trial,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> the nature of the allegations and the strength of its case, we do not, as the
    respondents suggest, view these concerns as providing the basis for substantial
    indemnity costs.  First, the trial judge
    did not rely on St. Elizabeth’s conduct for making the award; he relied instead
    on the offers to settle.  Furthermore,
    other than broad statements showing his disapproval for the length of the trial
    and the breadth and weakness of the claims advanced, the trial judge provided
    little detail and carried out little analysis of these concerns.  Nothing suggests they rose to a level where, according
    to the existing jurisprudence, substantial indemnity costs would have been
    warranted.  </span></p>
  <h3>(3)       Did the trial judge err in awarding the
    respondents costs for the contempt motion and the motion seeking particulars of
    the respondents’ bill of costs?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St. Elizabeth submits that it should not have been
    required to pay the costs incurred by the respondents for the contempt motion
    or for the motion requesting particulars of the respondents’ bill of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contempt motion related to the refusal by Ken
    Peters, a reporter for the Hamilton Spectator, to reveal his source for the
    information contained in an allegedly defamatory article he authored.  St. Elizabeth argues that the trial judge had
    ordered Peters to pay the costs and it would be a duplication to now order St.
    Elizabeth to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it was within the trial judge’s discretion
    to order St. Elizabeth to pay these costs.  Peters was called by St. Elizabeth as a witness at trial and so the
    costs incurred for the motion were properly considered to be trial costs.  The trial judge ordered Peters to pay a
    portion of the costs of the contempt motion as a penalty.  That penalty was overturned by this
    court.  As a result, there was no
    outstanding order that Peters pay the costs of the contempt motion and it was
    open to the trial judge to require St. Elizabeth to pay these costs.  We would not interfere with his exercise of
    discretion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the motion for particulars, St.
    Elizabeth argues that because further particulars of the respondents’ bill of
    costs were ordered, the motion was successful and costs should follow the
    result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, however, point out that the motion was
    settled while it was being argued.  In their
    view, the settlement was nothing more than the respondents’ agreeing to present
    the information already provided to St. Elizabeth, albeit in a different
    format.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it was within the trial judge’s discretion
    to rule as he did on this issue.</p>
  <h3>(4)       Did the trial judge err in failing to ensure that overall the
    costs award was fair and just?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St. Elizabeth submits that the trial judge carried out
    a purely mechanical review of the costs being claimed.  He did not, as he is required to do, review
    the award to determine whether, overall, it was fair and just in the
    result.  In St. Elizabeth’s view, the
    trial judge simply rubberstamped the respondents’ bill of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because we have concluded that the trial judge erred in
    awarding two separate sets of costs after amalgamation and in awarding
    substantial indemnity costs, there will be a significant reduction in the
    overall costs award.  This reduction, in
    and of itself, addresses the essence of St. Elizabeth’s complaint on the
    overall size of the costs award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even absent a reduction in the award, we would
    not have given effect to this ground of appeal.  In his reasons following the penultimate phase of the costs submissions,
    the trial judge specifically turned his mind to the issue of the overall amount
    of costs.  He referred to this court’s
    decision in <i>Boucher v. Public Accountants
    Council for the Province of Ontario</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.) and
    indicated that he was reserving his discretion “to actually fix the costs
    without a slavish adherence to arithmetic and with one last long look at what
    is overall a fair and just result.”  About a month later, the trial judge issued his final ruling on the
    costs issue and stated that he had exercised his discretion in fixing the
    amount of costs.  Read in the context of his
    earlier statement, it is apparent that the trial judge did turn his mind to the
    overall fairness of the costs award before making his decision.  </p>
  <h3>(b)       Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The substantial indemnity portion of
    the costs awarded was, for the City, $1,882,629 (90 per cent of the actual fees
    of $2,091,810) and, for the Region, $1,470,966 (90 per cent of the actual fees
    of $1,634,407).  From our review of the
    record, it appears that all other aspects of the costs award were made on a
    partial indemnity scale.  To reflect our
    decision that costs ought to have been awarded on a partial indemnity scale
    throughout, we would reduce the fees awarded to the City by $627,543 (30 per
    cent of $2,091,810) and reduce the fees awarded to the Region by $490,322 (30
    per cent of $1,634,407).  If, upon
    review, <span class=GramE>counsel determine</span> that other portions of the
    costs were awarded on a substantial indemnity basis, they can make the
    appropriate adjustments or make further submissions to the court.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Determining what adjustments should
    be made to reflect the duplication due to the Region and the City not
    undertaking a single defence after the January 1, 2001 amalgamation is not as
    straightforward.  As we have noted, the
    peculiar circumstances of this case made a period of significant continuing
    overlap by both sets of solicitors necessary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As well, the trial judge’s view
    that, at trial, counsel for the two former entities “made an appropriate
    division of labour and participation” should be reflected in any adjustment we
    make.  As noted by the respondents, this
    was a long and complex trial and the issue is not whether there were two
    separate sets of lawyers representing them, but rather whether there was a
    duplication of costs.  In their view, the
    court should find no duplication because despite having two sets of lawyers,
    the respondents only had four gowned counsel at trial on most days.  Similarly, St. Elizabeth had four gowned
    counsel at trial on many days.  The
    similarity suggests that the respondents had effectively combined their
    defences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, however, the fact that St.
    Elizabeth had four gowned counsel present at trial on many days does not mean
    that St. Elizabeth would necessarily have recovered fees for all four counsel in
    an assessment to determine reasonable trial costs.  Further, this submission only applies to the
    portion of the bill of costs relating to the trial costs.  The respondents had two sets of counsel
    attending the lengthy discoveries in this matter, most of which were held after
    the amalgamation.  In addition, both sets
    of lawyers for the respondents were supported by several lawyers at their
    respective firms and we expect that each firm would be preparing separate
    reports to their client, as well as engaging in meetings and exchanges to
    coordinate what were, in effect, separate defences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On the record before us, any
    adjustment we make will be no more than a rough estimate of the duplication
    that could reasonably have been avoided.  We do not, however, believe that the interests of the parties would be
    served by sending this matter for an assessment.  The matter is best disposed of by this
    court.  We would alter the award by
    adjusting the fee portion of both bills of costs by applying a further 25 per
    cent reduction to the post-amalgamation costs of both the City and the Region,
    after making the adjustment to reflect partial indemnity costs throughout.  We expect that there would be very little
    duplication in the disbursements and would make no adjustment to that figure.</span></p>
