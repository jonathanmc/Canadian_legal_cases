  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The question in this case is whether <span
style='line-height:200%'>the offence of trafficking
    ends at the moment its minimum constituent elements are established or
    continues until payment, in the case of a sale, is completed.  Put in a way that reflects the facts of this
    case, the question is:  Does a person who
    facilitates only the payment for drugs after delivery, participate in a “conspiracy”,
    as defined in ss. 465(1)(c) and 467.12(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, Chap. C-46, to “traffic” them, pursuant
    to s. 5(1) of the <i>Controlled Drugs and
    Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c.19 (the <i>CDSA</i>)?  The two courts that have dealt with this case
    have answered yes.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The reviewing judge, in denying the appellant’s application </span><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>to quash his committal order, held that although “an offence can
    be said to be 'complete' when all of the legal elements are present; that does
    not mean that it is concluded”.  His view
    was that there was “no reason why a completed offence cannot also be a
    continuing offence”.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On this appeal, the appellant argues that the reviewing judge
    erred in law in denying his application to quash the committals ordered by the
    preliminary hearing judge.  In the
    appellant’s interpretation of the offence of “trafficking”, his actions did not
    satisfy the test for committal for trial on the charges of conspiracy to
    traffic in Schedule III narcotics. </span></p>
  <h2>RELEVANT FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would note that, as the case is still at a preliminary
    stage, the facts have not been determined.  What follows, therefore, is a summary of the facts as alleged by the
    Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case arises out of an alleged drug deal
    involving the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC).  In 2005, Omid Bayani, associated with the
    Haney, British Columbia chapter of the HAMC, agreed to sell a substantial
    quantity of the narcotic 4-hydro-xybutanoic acid (GHB) to Mehrdad Bahman, a
    “prospect”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:
200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> for the Downtown Toronto chapter of the HAMC.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Before Bahman could pay for the shipment, however, the
    Toronto police surreptitiously removed it.  Bahman had intended to sell the GHB in order to pay for the shipment,
    and this source of funds was now lost.  The HAMC apparently prides itself on its reputation for honouring its
    commitments, and it was a matter of extreme importance to both chapters that a
    member of one chapter pay a drug debt owed to a member of another chapter.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Against this backdrop, the appellant, as a member of the
    Haney, B.C. chapter, became involved in efforts – ultimately successful – to
    persuade Bahman to pay Bayani for the lost GHB.  Arising out of this factual background the appellant, together with
    sixteen co-defendants, was charged with drug offences.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Specifically, and on the basis of this involvement with the
    drug deal, t</span>he appellant was committed to stand trial on two counts of
    conspiracy: (i) <span style='line-height:200%'>to
    traffic in GHB contrary to s. 465(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and (ii) to traffic in GHB in association with a
    criminal organization, contrary to s. 467.12 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  </span>He was
    discharged in respect of one count of the substantive offence of trafficking.</p>
  <h2><i>Decision of the preliminary inquiry judge</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry judge dealt squarely
    with the question of whether the delivery of the drugs concluded or
    “crystallized” the offence.  Her
    conclusion on this issue is found in his reasons at para. 412:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… [T]he normal use of the word “sell” - and sale
    includes the payment of consideration - the trafficking of the GHB did not end
    with the delivery of the drugs to Mr. Bahman.  I find that it was a continuing transaction, one which other
    co-conspirators could join in, until the contract was complete.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry judge then held that the
    conspiracy continued beyond the delivery of the drugs to Mr. Bahman and throughout
    the dispute between Mr. Bahman and Mr. Bayani over how much was owed.  She held that the sale would not have been completed
    until the consideration had been paid to Mr. Bayani.  She found that the appellant joined the
    conspiracy when he involved himself in the payment dispute.</p>
  <h2><i>Decision of the reviewing judge</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The reviewing judge agreed with the preliminary
    inquiry judge’s assessment of the charges, and found that the appellant’s
    involvement in the deal was caught by the definition of “trafficking” in s. 2
    of the <i>CDSA</i>.  That is, trafficking includes the “sale” of
    drugs, and a sale includes both the delivery of the drugs and the corresponding
    payment for the drugs.  The transaction,
    he held, included both the delivery of the drugs and the delivery of the
    payment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The reviewing judge relied on the plain meaning of the word
    “sell” and at para. 17 of his reasons noted that the defence was attempting to
    “separate the <i>quid</i> from the <i>quo</i>” by arguing that payment does not
    form part of a sales transaction.  He concluded that a jury could find that the
    “trafficking” transaction did not terminate with the delivery of the drugs, but
    that it was a continuing transaction that remained unconcluded until Bahman
    fulfilled his side of the bargain.  He
    then held that the appellant’s involvement in the payment for the drugs would
    be enough, in such a case, to satisfy the definition of trafficking.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant raises a single issue on this appeal.  As I noted, he asserts that his actions did
    not amount to a conspiracy to traffic in illegal drugs.  I disagree, and for the reasons that follow,
    I would dismiss his appeal.</span></p>
  <h2>POSITION OF THE PARTIES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the evidence was that
    his only involvement in the drug deal post-dated the delivery of the drugs by
    Bayani to Bahman.  The payment of the
    debt incurred by Bahman, he contends, was not an element of the offence of
    trafficking, nor was it the criminal purpose shared in common by Bahman and
    Bayani.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s argument is essentially that the
    definition of “traffic” includes, “to sell, administer, give, transfer,
    transport, send or deliver the substance.”  In this case, the appellant is only accused of offences in connection
    with the “sell” component.  Therefore, to
    establish that he participated in a conspiracy to traffic narcotics, the Crown
    must establish that he participated in a conspiracy to sell them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In addition, the appellant points out that the definition of
    “sell” in s. 2(1)(a) includes “offer for sale, expose for sale, have in
    possession for sale, and distribute, whether or not the distribution is made
    for consideration.”  It does not, he
    contends, require the Crown to show payment in order to establish selling.  Therefore, he concludes, o</span><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>nce a prohibited drug is delivered or given to another person, the
    offence of trafficking is proven.  The
    receipt of money is not an element of the offence of trafficking.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In support of his argument, the appellant cites a number of
    cases where defendants were successfully prosecuted for delivering drugs
    despite there being no evidence that they had received payment.  In those cases, the court found that the
    offence was “complete” upon delivery of the drugs and therefore convicted the
    defendants.  Among these cases is <i>R v. Falahatchian</i>, [1995] O.J. No. 1896
    (CA) which held at p. 20:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Once a prohibited drug is delivered or given to
    another person, the offence of trafficking is proven.  The receipt of money is not an element of the
    offence of trafficking [citations omitted].  When Falahatchian gave the heroin to Akbari, the offence of trafficking
    was complete.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, he submits, because the delivery, and
    therefore the sale, was completed at the time the appellant became involved, he
    could not have conspired to sell drugs; rather, his participation came after
    the crime had been completed.<span style='line-height:
200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The Crown, on the other hand, argues
    that the definition of trafficking is very broad and deliberately so in order
    to capture </span>every mode of behaviour that contributes to the proliferation
    of harmful, illicit drugs and all the elements of drug dealing, drug sharing
    and drug distribution.  <span
style='line-height:200%'>The Crown submits that the
    word “traffic” must be interpreted in light of this purpose, which is to cast a
    net wide enough to prosecute all aspects of a drug transaction, including the
    negotiation and payment of a price.  They
    also rely on the ordinary meaning of the word “sell” which is an exchange of
    goods or services for payment.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>In the Crown’s submission, when a
    group of people have a meeting of the minds that a commercial sale of illegal
    drugs should be completed, this meets the definition of “trafficking”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Crown argues that t</span>he evidence at the appellant’s
    preliminary inquiry gave rise to the permissible inference that he joined an
    agreement whereby the sale of G.H.B. from Bayani to Bahman was to be completed.  <span style='line-height:200%;'>This was, it is argued, an ongoing
    drug deal; the drugs were “fronted” with the expectation of repayment, funded
    by the resale of the drugs. This, it is said, demonstrates that the parties
    contemplated that the drug transaction was ongoing in nature.  </span></p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the question on this appeal turns on an exercise
    of statutory interpretation.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The traditional rule for interpreting penal statutes requires
    strict construction, wherein any ambiguity is resolved in favour of the
    defendant.  However, as Cory J. noted at
    para. 30 of <i>R v. Hasselwander,</i> [1993]
    2 S.C.R. 398, “even with penal statutes, the real intention of the legislature
    must be sought, and the meaning compatible with its goals applied.”  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span
style='line-height:200%'>Hasselwander</span></i><span
style='line-height:200%'> dealt with the definition
    of automatic weapons.  In determining the
    intention of the legislature, Cory J. took note of the danger posed to society
    by automatic weapons, stating that, “[t]here is good reason to prohibit their
    use in light of the threat which they pose and the unlimited use to which they
    can be put.  Their prohibition ensures a
    safer society.”  He therefore read the
    relevant definitions in a broad manner, defining automatic weapons as including
    weapons that could easily be converted from semi-automatic to automatic.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would apply the same reasoning to the present case.  Parliament has determined that the traffic in
    narcotics such as GHB poses a significant risk to society.  They have therefore enacted wide ranging
    legislation to prohibit this trade.  I
    agree with the reasons of Dubé J.A. in <i>R.
    v. Rousseau, </i>(1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 445 at 451 (Que. C.A.), leave ref’d
    [1992] 1 S.C.R. x that the intention of Parliament was to “prohibit all forms
    of action which encompass the circulation of narcotics.”  </span></p>

    the goal of which is to facilitate prosecution of individuals who participate
    in or contribute to the trafficking of narcotics.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant proposes a definition of “sell” and “traffic”
    that, when read with the <i>Criminal Code </i>provisions
    on conspiracy, would limit criminal liability to actions taken up to the point
    at which drugs are delivered.  In my
    view, such a narrow view of drug transactions is contrary to the purposes of
    the relevant provisions of the <i>CDSA</i> and <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Indeed, the appellant’s view is that by enacting a wide
    definition of “sell” that creates liability for people participating in various
    aspects of drug transactions such as delivery under the <i>CDSA</i>, Parliament simultaneously truncated the applicability of the <i>Criminal Code</i>’s conspiracy provisions to
    these same transactions.  If this were
    correct, the <i>CDSA </i>and <i>Criminal Code </i>would be working at cross
    purposes. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant is however correct to note that it is not
    necessary for the Crown to prove that payment has been made in order to
    establish that a drug was sold.  Nevertheless,
    this does not make the payment of money irrelevant to, or separate from, the
    drug transaction.  The definition of sell
    includes distributing, “whether or not the distribution is made for
    consideration.”  I read this as meaning
    that distributing without receiving consideration is selling, as is
    distributing in exchange for consideration.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the present case, Bayani and Bahman were engaged in
    distributing for consideration.  This
    meets the definition of selling, and therefore constitutes trafficking contrary
    to s. 5(1) of the <i>CDSA</i>.  The appellant assisted in arranging for the
    consideration to be paid.  In that sense,
    he conspired in the offence for the purposes of ss. 465(1)(c) and 467.12(1) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The fact that one can imagine a hypothetical
    situation where Bayani would have given the drugs to Bahman for free does not
    change the facts of the transaction as it occurred.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Similarly, the possibility that Bayani or Bahman could have
    been charged before the appellant participated in the transaction is of no
    moment.  Indeed, Bayani could have been
    charged at the moment he offered to sell the drugs.  He was not.  On the facts of this case, as presented at the preliminary inquiry, a
    number of individuals participated in a conspiracy to exchange drugs for money,
    contrary to s. 5(1) of the <i>CDSA</i>.  The appellant was among them.</span></p>
