    of the Divisional Court (Kiteley, Swinton JJ., Lederman J. dissenting) dated
    September 9, 2008.  The court declared
    that the Ontario Energy Board exceeded its jurisdiction and erred in law when
    it imposed, as a condition in its rate decision for 2006, a duty on Toronto
    Hydro-Electric System Limited to obtain the approval of a majority of its
    independent directors before declaring any future dividends payable to its

    Hydro-Electric System Limited (“THESL”) is an electricity distributor licensed
    and regulated by the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”).  THESL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toronto
    Hydro Corporation (“THC”). All of the shares of THC are owned by the City of
    Toronto (the “City”).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    2004-2005, THC paid over $116 million to the City in the form of dividends and
    interest payments.  THC funded a
    significant part of these payments through substantial annual increases in
    dividends from THESL and by charging THESL an above-market rate of interest on
    an inter-company loan.  At the time THESL
    made the payments it had not completed a capital plan for reinvestment in its
    aging infrastructure.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    THESL applied to the OEB for approval of its distribution rates to be effective
    May 2006, the OEB expressed concern about the level of dividend payments and
    the above-market rate of interest being paid by THESL.  Evidence before the OEB disclosed that the
    City anticipated a significant shortfall in its 2006 operating budget; that the
    City regarded THC as “a revenue source in the 2006 operating budget”; and that the
    City demanded substantial increases in dividends from THC which, in turn,
    demanded increased dividends from THESL.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    OEB is the regulator of Ontario’s electricity industry, and is statutorily mandated
    to “protect the interests of consumers with respect to prices and the adequacy,
    reliability and quality of electricity service.”  The OEB manages this mandate primarily by
    setting just and reasonable rates.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    its decision, the OEB disallowed as a regulatory expense any interest charges
    above market rates, and required a majority of THESL’s independent directors to
    approve any future dividend payments.  In
    reaching this decision, the OEB noted that if a utility like THESL was to pay
    all of its retained earnings to its shareholders, this could adversely affect
    its credit rating, which in turn could harm ratepayer interests by causing
    higher costs and degradation in services. THESL appealed this decision. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the Divisional Court, THESL argued that the OEB had no jurisdiction to impose
    the condition it did, either by statute or at common law, and further that the
    imposition of such a condition represented an unwarranted and indeed unlawful
    restriction on the authority of the board of directors to declare a dividend.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    majority in the Divisional Court accepted THESL’s position on both bases
    advanced, allowed the appeal and set aside the part of the OEB decision that imposed
    the condition.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    OEB argues that the majority of the Divisional Court panel failed to appreciate
    and distinguish the principles that govern regulated utilities like THESL,
    which operate as monopolies, from those that apply to private sector companies,
    which operate in a competitive market.  The OEB submits that this distinction is critical because whereas the
    directors and officers of an unregulated company have a fiduciary obligation to
    act in the best interests of the company (which usually equates to the
    interests of the shareholders), a regulated utility must operate in a manner that
    balances the interests of the utility’s shareholders against the interests of
    its ratepayers. If a utility fails to operate in this way, it is incumbent on
    the OEB to intervene in order to strike this balance and protect the interests
    of ratepayers.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the
    Divisional Court and restore the part of the rate decision that imposed the
    condition.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue for this court is whether the OEB had the ability, as part of its 2006
    rate decision, to require THESL to obtain the approval of a majority of its
    independent directors before declaring any dividends.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
    recent years administrative law has undergone a significant transformation.  Ever since Dickson J. </span>championed the
    notion of increased deference to specialized administrative tribunals in <i>Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local
    963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp., </i>[1979] 2 S.C.R. 227 (“<i>CUPE</i>”), courts have sought to avoid
    labelling matters as jurisdictional where such a label might lead to a more
    searching review of the administrative decision than is appropriate in the
    circumstances.  In <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, Bastarache and
    LeBel JJ. <span class=GramE>underlined</span> the importance of <i>CUPE</i> in this regard at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Prior to <i>CUPE</i>, judicial review followed the
    “preliminary question doctrine”, which inquired into whether a tribunal had
    erred in determining the scope of its jurisdiction.
    By simply branding an issue as “jurisdictional”, courts could replace a
    decision of the tribunal with one they preferred, often at the expense of a
    legislative intention that the matter lie in the hands of the administrative
    tribunal. <i>CUPE </i>marked a significant turning point in the approach of
    courts to judicial review, most notably in Dickson J.’s warning that courts
    “should not be alert to brand as jurisdictional, and therefore subject to
    broader curial review, that which may be doubtfully so” (p. 233). Dickson J.’s
    policy of judicial respect for administrative decision making marked the
    beginning of the modern era of Canadian administrative law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Support for the <i>CUPE</i> conceptualization of jurisdiction is also found in the majority reasons of
    Abella J. in <i>Council of Canadians with
    Disabilities v. VIA Rail Canada Inc., </i>[2007] 1 S.C.R. 650, at paras. 88-89:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Federal Court of Appeal also concluded that the
    standard for reviewing the Agency’s decision on the issue of whether an
    obstacle is <span class=GramE>undue,</span> is patent unreasonableness. I
    agree. I do not, however, share the majority’s view that VIA raised a
    preliminary, jurisdictional question falling outside the Agency’s expertise
    that was, therefore, subject to a different standard of review. Applying such
    an approach has the capacity to unravel the essence of the decision and
    undermine the very characteristic of the Agency which entitles it to the
    highest level of deference from a court — its specialized expertise. It ignores
    Dickson J.’s caution in [<i>CUPE</i>] that
    courts “should not be alert to brand as jurisdictional, and therefore subject
    to broader curial review, that which may be doubtfully so”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>If every
    provision of a tribunal’s enabling legislation were treated as if it </i><i>had
    jurisdictional consequences that permitted a court to substitute its own view
    of the correct interpretation, a tribunal’s role would be effectively reduced
    to fact-finding</i>. Judicial or
    appellate review will “be better informed by an appreciation of the views of
    the tribunal operating daily in the relevant field”.   Just as courts “should not be alert to brand
    as jurisdictional, and therefore subject to broader curial review, that which
    may be doubtfully so”, so should they also refrain from overlooking the
    expertise a tribunal may bring to the exercise of interpreting its enabling
    legislation and defining the scope of its statutory authority. [Emphasis added;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Genuine questions regarding the boundaries of
    administrative authority under statute do arise. Administrative bodies must be
    correct in answering these questions.  It
    is crucial to distinguish, however, between these “true” matters of
    jurisdiction and the wider understanding of jurisdiction that Dickson J.
    rebuked in <i>CUPE</i>.  This point was highlighted by Bastarache and
    LeBel JJ. <span class=GramE>in</span> <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 59:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Administrative bodies must also be correct in their
    determinations of true questions of
    jurisdiction or <i>vires</i>. We mention true questions of <i>vires </i>to
    distance ourselves from the extended definitions adopted before <i>CUPE</i>. It
    is important here to take a robust view of jurisdiction. We neither wish nor
    intend to return to the jurisdiction/preliminary question doctrine that plagued
    the jurisprudence in this area for many years. <i>“Jurisdiction” is intended in the narrow sense of whether or not the
    tribunal had the authority to make the inquiry. In other words, true
    jurisdiction questions arise where the tribunal must explicitly determine
    whether its statutory grant of power gives it the authority to decide a
    particular matter</i>. The tribunal must interpret the grant of authority
    correctly or its action will be found to be <i>ultra vires </i>or to constitute
    a wrongful decline of jurisdiction. An example may be found in <i>United Taxi
    Drivers’ Fellowship of Southern Alberta v. Calgary (City)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 485. In that case,
    the issue was whether the City of Calgary was authorized under the relevant
    municipal acts to enact bylaws limiting the number of taxi plate licences. That
    case involved the decision-making powers of a municipality and exemplifies a
    true question of jurisdiction or <i>vires</i>. These questions will be narrow.
    We reiterate the caution of Dickson J. in <i>CUPE</i> that reviewing judges must not brand as jurisdictional issues
  that are doubtfully so. [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David Phillip Jones and Anne S. de Villars offer a
    helpful analysis of the difference between the “narrow” and “wide” meaning of
    jurisdiction in their text, <i>Principles of
    Administrative Law</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed. (Toronto:  Carswell, 2009) at pp. 140-41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In its broadest sense, “jurisdiction” means the
    authority to do every aspect of an <i>intra
    vires </i>action.  In a narrower sense,
    however, “jurisdiction” means the power to commence or embark on a particular
    type of activity. A defect in jurisdiction “in the narrow sense” is thus
    distinguished from other errors – such as a breach of a duty to be fair,
    considering irrelevant evidence, acting for an improper purpose, or reaching an
    unreasonable result – which take place <i>after </i>the delegate has lawfully started its activity, but which cause it to leave
    or exceed its jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                            ...</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is important to remember that virtually all
    grounds for judicial review of administrative action depend upon an attack on
    some aspect of the delegate’s jurisdiction (in the wider sense) to do the
    particular activity in question.  Consequently,
    it is equally important to remember that any behaviour which causes the
    delegate to <i>exceed </i>its jurisdiction
    is just as fatal as any error which means that it never had jurisdiction “in
    the narrow sense” even to commence the exercise of its jurisdiction. [Italics
    in original; footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further guidance in terms of defining exactly what
    constitutes “true” questions of jurisdiction can be gleaned from the reasons of
    Abella J. in <i>VIA Rail</i>. At para. 91,<i> </i>she cited <i>Pasiechnyk v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), </i>[1997] 2
    S.C.R. 890, at para. 18, for the proposition that “[t]he <span class=GramE>test</span> as to whether the provision in question is one that limits jurisdiction
    is:  was the question which the provision
    raises one that was intended by legislators to be left to the exclusive
    decision of the Board?”  In the same
    paragraph, Abella J. also referred to <i>U.E.S.,
    Local 298 v. Bibeault</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048, at p. 1087, where Beetz J.
    held that “the only question which should be asked [is], ‘Did the legislator
    intend the question to be within the jurisdiction conferred on the
    tribunal?’”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the focus is on discerning legislative intent
    with respect to the scope of a tribunal’s authority to undertake an inquiry.
    This reading is consistent with Bastarache and LeBel JJ.’s observation that
    “[d]eference will usually result where a tribunal is interpreting its own statute
    or statutes closely connected to its function, with which it will have
    particular familiarity” (<i>Dunsmuir </i>at
    para. 54), and Abella J.’s conclusion that “[a] tribunal with the power to
    decide questions of law is a tribunal with the power to decide questions
    involving the statutory interpretation of its enabling legislation” (<i>VIA Rail</i> at para. 92).  It also accords with Jones and de Villars observation
    at p. 146:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] <span class=GramE>conscious</span> and
    clearly-worded decision by the legislature to use a subjective or open-ended
    grant of power has the effect of widening the delegate’s jurisdiction and,
    therefore, narrowing the ambit of judicial review of the legality of its
    actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts should hesitate to analyze the decisions of
    specialized tribunals through the lens of jurisdiction unless it is clear that
    the tribunal exceeded its statutory powers by entering into an area of inquiry
    outside of what the legislature intended. If the decision of a specialized
    tribunal aims to achieve a valid statutory purpose, and the enabling statute
    includes a broad grant of open-ended power to achieve that purpose, the matter
    should be considered within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  Its substance may still be reviewed for other
    reasons – on either a reasonableness or correctness standard – but it does not
    engage a true question of jurisdiction and cannot be quashed on the basis that
    the tribunal could not “make the inquiry” or “embark on a particular type of
    activity”.  In contrast, where a tribunal
    is pursuing an illegitimate objective, or is engaging in actions that clearly
    defy the limits of its statutory authority, then a reviewing court may properly
    declare its decisions to be <i>ultra vires.</i>  These principles are consistent with Abella
    J.’s reasoning in <i>VIA Rail </i>at para.
    96:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It seems to me counterproductive for courts to
    parse and recharacterize aspects of a tribunal’s core jurisdiction... in a way
    that undermines the deference that jurisdiction was conferred to protect.  By attributing a jurisdiction-limiting label,
    such as “statutory interpretation” or “human rights”, to what is in reality a
    function assigned and properly exercised under the enabling legislation, a
    tribunal’s expertise is made to defer to a court’s generalism rather than the
    other way around.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, in <i>Advocacy
    Centre for Tenants-Ontario v. Ontario Energy Board </i>(2008), 293 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    684 (Ont. Div. Ct.), the majority of the court held that the OEB had the
    jurisdiction to establish a rate affordability assistance program for
    low-income consumers purchasing the distribution of natural gas from the utility.  Section 36(3) of the Act states that “[i]n
    approving or fixing just and reasonable rates, the Board may adopt any method
    or technique it considers appropriate.”  In
    paras. 53-56, the majority noted the breadth of the OEB’s rate-setting power when
    its actions were in furtherance of the statutory objectives:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Board is authorized to employ “any method or
    technique that it considers appropriate” to fix “just and reasonable rates.”... <span class=GramE>the</span> Board must determine what are “just and reasonable

    protecting “the interests of consumers with respect to prices.” </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Board in the consideration of its statutory
    objectives might consider it appropriate to use a specific “method or
    technique” in the implementation of its basic “cost of service” calculation to
    arrive at a final fixing of rates that are considered “just and reasonable
    rates.” This could mean, for example, to further the objective of “energy
    conservation”, the use of incentive rates or differential pricing dependent
    upon the quantity of energy consumed. As well, to further the objective of
    protecting “the interests of consumers” this could mean taking into account
    income levels in pricing to achieve the delivery of affordable energy to low
    income consumers on the basis that this meets the objective of protecting “the
    interests of consumers with respect to prices.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board is engaged in rate-setting within the

    manner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the OEB was also reviewed in <i>Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. v. Ontario
    Energy Board.</i> (2005), 74 O.R. (3d) 147 (C.A.).  In <i>Enbridge</i>,
    the OEB issued a rule permitting the gas vendor to determine who will bill its
    customers for the gas they buy from a vendor and for its transportation to them
    by the distributor.  The appellants
    argued that this rule went beyond the jurisdiction conferred on the OEB by s.
    44(1) of the Act, which provides that the OEB may make rules “governing the
    conduct of a gas distributor as such conduct relates to [a gas vendor]”.  Goudge J.A. ultimately found that the OEB had
    the jurisdiction to issue the rule. He endorsed a broad understanding of the
    Act in paras. 27-28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The
    appellants] say that the intention of this subsection is to limit the Board's jurisdiction<b><span style='color:#CD0033'> </span></b><span
style='color:black'>to a rule governing only the part of a gas distributor's
    conduct that relates to its business relationship with a gas vendor, such as
    when the gas vendor acts as agent on behalf of its gas supply customer to
    arrange with the gas distributor for delivery of that gas supply to that
    customer. ... </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my
    view, there is nothing in either the language of s. 44(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    or its statutory context to suggest such a narrow interpretation. ... Moreover,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A recent decision from the Divisional Court
    offers further support for the proposition that the OEB enjoys a wide ambit of power
    in its rate-setting function.  In <i>Toronto Hydro-Electric System Ltd. v.
    Ontario Energy Board et al.</i> (2009)<i>, </i>252
    O.A.C. 188 (Div. Ct.), leave to appeal to Ont. C.A. refused, the OEB allocated
    THESL’s net after-tax gains on the sale of three properties to reduce THESL’s
    revenue requirement, and thereby also reduce electricity distribution rates to
    ratepayers. The court unanimously held that the proper approach to a review of the
    OEB decision did not involve a “true” jurisdictional analysis as contemplated
    in <i>Dunsmuir</i>.  Rather, a reasonableness standard applied
    because the decision in the case – whether and how the OEB may allocate the net
    after-tax gains on the sale of properties to reduce THESL’s revenue requirement
    - was squarely within the rate-setting authority of the OEB and went to very
    core of the OEB’s mandate. The court noted the expansive content of the
    rate-setting power at para. 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An OEB decision may well engage or impact
    principles of corporate law, given that it regulates incorporated distributors,
    but the nature of the issue must be viewed in light of the regulatory scheme.
    While the decision in this case may have the effect of curtailing the appellant’s
    ability to otherwise distribute or invest the net after tax gains from the sale
    of the properties, the substance of the OEB’s decision relates to whether and
    how to apply those gains in its rate setting formula. <span class=GramE>Unlike
    the cases relied upon, this issue directly relates to the OEB’s determination
    of rates and goes to the heart of its regulatory authority and expertise.</span>  There is no dispute that the OEB has rate-setting
    powers under the <i>OEBA</i> which are broad
    enough to encompass the power to determine reduced revenue requirements as a
    result of the sale of non-surplus assets. Although there is no privative
    clause, the OEB is a highly specialized expert tribunal with broad authority to
    regulate the energy sector in Ontario and to balance competing interests.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The present appeal does not engage a “true” question of
    jurisdiction. As confirmed above, the Act is to be interpreted broadly. It is
    clear that the legislative intent of s. 78 of the Act is that the OEB have the
    principal responsibility for setting electricity rates.  The Act specifies that in carrying out its
    responsibilities the OEB <i>shall</i> be
    guided by the objectives in s. 1(1), which include protecting the interests of
    customers with respect to prices and the adequacy, reliability and quality of
    electricity service. The Act also permits the OEB in making an order, to impose
    such conditions as <i>it</i> considers
    proper, and states that these conditions may be general or particular in
    application (s. 23(1)). Thus, the legislation reflects a clear intent by
    legislators to use both a subjective and open-ended grant of power to enable
    the OEB to engage in the impugned inquiry in the course of rate setting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, it is apparent that as part of its
    rate-setting function, the OEB was entitled to consider the history of THESL’s
    dividend payments. This was part of the inquiry into whether and how to control
    outgoing cash flows from THESL in order to ensure adequate capital. This line
    of inquiry goes to the heart of the OEB achieving its statutory objectives. In
    its reasons, the OEB noted that at the hearing there was considerable
    discussion of the dividend issue and that information concerning the dividend
    payouts had been filed. An inquiry into dividend payments was an inquiry that
    all parties believed was within the OEB’s jurisdiction. The “true” nature of
    the respondent’s challenge cannot be characterized as a matter of jurisdiction.
    Of course, it does not follow that the methods chosen are insulated from review
    (see Part IV). </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      <u>The <i>ATCO</i> Decision</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THESL argues that the Supreme Court of Canada’s recent
    decision in <i>ATCO Gas &amp; Pipeline Ltd.
    v. Alberta (Energy &amp; Utilities Board)</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, militates
    in favour of reviewing OEB decisions using a correctness standard.  <i>ATCO</i> involved an application by ATCO to have the sale of a property approved by the Alberta
    Energy and Utilities Board as required by the statute. The Board approved the sale
    and imposed a condition requiring that a certain portion of the sale proceeds
    be allocated to rate-paying customers. The <i>Alberta
    Energy Board Utilities Act</i> set out that with respect to an order, the Board
    may “impose any additional conditions that the Board considers necessary in the
    public interest”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Writing on behalf of three other justices, Bastarache
    J. divided the inquiry into two questions. The first question was whether the
    Board had the power pursuant to its enabling statutes to allocate the proceeds
    from the sale of the utility’s asset to its customers when approving the sale.
    The second question was whether the Board was permitted to allocate the
    proceeds of the sale in the way that it did. Bastarache J. concluded that the first
    question was to be reviewed on a correctness standard and the second question
    was to be reviewed on a more deferential standard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is distinguishable from <i>ATCO</i>. The statutory grant of power in <i>ATCO</i> to “impose any additional conditions that the Board considers
    necessary in the public interest” is different than the statutory grant of
    power in this case. Bastarache J. referred to this provision as vague, elastic,
    and open-ended. In the present case, the OEB’s imposition of a condition it considers
    proper (s. 23(1)) has to be guided by the legislated objectives set out in s.
    1(1). These objectives are not vague, elastic, and open-ended. To the extent
    that there is uncertainty with respect to the achievement of the s. 1(1) objectives,
    that is a matter undeniably within the expertise of the OEB. Further, unlike
    the <i>ATCO</i> provision, the objectives in
    the Act require that the OEB protect the interests of <i>both</i> the customer and the utility.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are four other factors that support distinguishing <i>ATCO</i> from this case. First, the
    decision in <i>ATCO</i> reveals that
    Bastarache J. reasoned that <i>ATCO</i> was
    not a rate-setting case. He noted that the provision granting the power to
    impose conditions could not be read in isolation. Rather, he explained that the
    provision had to be considered within the context of the purpose and scheme of
    the legislation. Bastarache J. stated that the main purpose of the Board is
    rate setting. The allocation of the sale proceeds did not fit within the limits
    of the powers of the Board, which “are grounded in its main function of fixing
    just and reasonable rates (‘rate setting’) and in protecting the integrity and
    dependability of the supply system” (para. 7).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, at para. 30, Bastarache J. determined that the
    Board’s protective role - safeguarding the public interest in the nature and
    quality of the service provided to the community by public utilities by
    ensuring that utility rates are always just and reasonable - did not come into
    play. This factor pointed to a less deferential standard of review. In the
    present case, the OEB’s “protective role” was central to the dividend
    condition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Bastarache J<span class=GramE>.,</span> viewed
    the issue in <i>ATCO</i> as the Board’s
    power to transfer proprietary rights in the assets of the utility to the
    customers. In this case, the dividend condition did not result in the transfer
    of proprietary rights. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, in giving examples of conditions that could
    attach to the approval of a sale, Bastarache J. stated at para. 77 that the
    Board “could also require as a condition that the utility reinvest part of the
    sale proceeds back into the company in order to maintain a modern operating
    system that achieves the optimal growth of the system.” As will be explained,
    the OEB placed the condition on the payment of dividends to ensure that
    dividends would not be paid when there was insufficient capital for plant
    maintenance.</p>

    result of an accounting error.  Writing
    for the panel, Juriansz J.A. reviewed some of the recent appellate
    jurisprudence and concluded that reasonableness was the appropriate standard of
    review as the question was one of mixed fact and law, and also involved policy

    while the result did not turn on the standard of review, Doherty J.A. did note

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that the Act constitutes the OEB as a
    specialized expert tribunal with the broad authority to regulate the energy
    sector in Ontario. In carrying out its mandate, the OEB is required to balance
    a number of sometimes competing goals. On the one hand, it is required to protect
    consumers with respect to prices and the reliability and quality of gas
    service, but on the other hand, it is to facilitate a financially viable gas
    industry. The legislative intent is evident: the OEB is to have the primary
    responsibility for setting gas rates in the province.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>The Act does not contain

    the reasonableness analysis.  In my view,
    the nature of the OEB decision – structuring a condition that will protect the
    long-term integrity of THESL’s energy infrastructure – falls squarely within
    the category of “mixed fact and law” with “policy considerations”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons given by the majority below for
    applying a correctness standard was because the case dealt with principles of
    corporate law. When dealing with a regulated corporation the fact that
    corporate law principles are at play does not alone suggest a correctness
    standard of review. Corporate law principles will often be engaged when making decisions
    in respect of regulated corporations. It is the regulator’s duty to use its
    expertise to apply corporate law principles within the context of its objectives;
    this implies a reasonableness standard. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 47 of <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    Bastarache and LeBel JJ. described the two inquiries involved in assessing
    the  reasonableness of a decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated
    by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards
    of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals
    do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead, they may
    give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals have a
    margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions. A
    court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that
    make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the
    reasons and to outcomes. <i>In judicial
    review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification,
    transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is
    also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible,
    acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. </i>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first inquiry of the reasonableness analysis is into
    the “existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the
    decision-making process.”  The second inquiry
    is “concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible,
    acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of facts and law.” Thus,
    the first inquiry deals with the justification process as articulated in the
    reasons for the decision and the second inquiry looks at the outcome. As noted
    in <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the reasonableness
    analysis will concern mostly the first inquiry. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inquiry into the justification, transparency and
    intelligibility of the decision-making process is focused on the reasons for
    the decision. In an oft-cited passage from <i>Law
    Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, Iacobucci J. at
    para. 55 articulated the relationship between the reasons of a tribunal and the
    ultimate reasonableness of its decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no
    line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the
    tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it
    arrived.  If any of the reasons that are
    sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can
    stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be
    unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere. <i>This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if
    it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one
    that the reviewing court finds compelling</i>.  [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    as Abella J. explained in <i>Via Rail</i> at
    para. 104:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Where
    an expert and specialized tribunal <span class=GramE>has</span> charted an
    appropriate analytical course for itself, with reasons that serve as a rational

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And
    as more recently noted by Binnie J. in <i>Canada
    (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 59:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Reasonableness
    is <span class=GramE>a single standard that take</span> its colour from the
    context. … [A]s long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably within the
    principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open
    to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome.</span></p>
  <p><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>and</span></span><span lang=EN-US> at para. 63:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span
lang=EN-US>Dunsmuir</span></i><span lang=EN-US> thus reinforces in the context of adjudicative
    tribunals the importance of reasons, which constitute the primary form of
    accountability of the decision-maker to the applicant, to the public and to a
    reviewing court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OEB’s reasons provide an intelligible explanation
    for the condition. The reasons both disclose a concern relating to “prices and the
    adequacy, reliability and quality” of service and explain how the chosen remedy
    will help to alleviate this concern. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before addressing these two elements, it is important
    to note one factor about the context of the decision. THESL is what has been
    described as a “regulated monopoly”. As Bastarache J. explained in <i>ATCO </i>at para. 3, “utility regulations
    exist to protect the public from monopolistic behaviour and the consequent
    inelasticity of demand while ensuring the continued quality of an essential service”.
    In other words, the OEB’s regulatory power is designed to act as a proxy in the
    public interest for competition: see <i>Advocacy
    Centre for Tenants-Ontario</i>. Because there is no competition, THESL could
    easily pass on the expense of business decisions to ratepayers through
    increased utility prices, or through the degradation of the quality of service,
    without the usual risk of losing customers. As was explained in para. 39 of <i>Advocacy Centre for Tenants-Ontario</i>, “[t]he
    Board’s mandate through economic regulation is directed primarily at avoiding
    the potential problem of excessive prices resulting because of a monopoly
    distributor of an essential service.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    THESL is incorporated, as is required by s. 142 of the <i>Electricity Act</i>, under the provisions of the <i>Business Corporation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, (“<i>OBCA</i>”) it is publicly regulated rather
    than a private corporation.  This
    distinction is an important one.  As
    Lederman J. noted in his dissenting reasons in the court below at para. 78:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>At
    the heart of a regulator’s rate-making authority <span class=GramE>lies</span> the “regulatory compact” which involves balancing the interests of investors
    and consumers. In this regard, there is an important distinction between
    private corporations and publicly regulated corporations.  With respect to the latter, in order to
    achieve the “regulatory compact”, it is not unusual to have constraints imposed
    on utilities that may place some restrictions on the board of directors.  That is so because the directors of utility
    companies have an obligation not only to the company, but to the public at
    large.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    principles that govern a regulated utility that operates as a monopoly differ
    from those that apply to private sector companies, which operate in a
    competitive market.  The directors and
    officers of unregulated companies have a fiduciary obligation to act in the
    best interests of the company (which is often interpreted to mean in the best
    interests of the shareholders) while a regulated utility must operate in a
    manner that balances the interests of the utility’s shareholders against those
    of its ratepayers.  If a utility fails to
    operate in this way, it is incumbent on the OEB to intervene in order to strike
    this balance and protect the interests of the ratepayers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision reveals that the OEB was concerned about
    the aging plant and the lack of necessary capital.  At the hearing it was argued that there
    appeared to be underinvestment in the physical plant over the past several
    years (para. 4.4.1). Evidence was presented that 30 to 40 per cent of the plant
    in service had exceeded its expected life (para. 4.5.3). The Board concluded
    that increased capital spending was required to address the issues of the aging
    plant (para. 4.7.1) and to maintain system reliability (para. 4.10.8).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, despite the need for capital, the evidence was
    that there was a very dramatic increase in the dividend payouts in 2004 and
    2005. As the OEB noted at para. 6.4.1, “[t]he level of dividends appears to be
    greater than the net income of the utility over at least a two year period.” At
    para. 6.4.4 the OEB explained why these events were of concern:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question arises as to whether the Board should
    restrict the dividend payout by the utility. To the extent a utility pays all
    of its retained earnings to the shareholder, it will become more dependent on
    borrowing and this may have an adverse effect on its credit rating.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the OEB was concerned because THESL was paying THC
    very large dividends even though increased capital spending was going to be
    needed to maintain system reliability. THESL was either going to ignore its
    aging infrastructure or have to borrow funds to address it. Both courses of
    conduct would ultimately, as the OEB explained, have adverse effects on
    ratepayers. Lederman J. effectively summarized these circumstances at paras. 80
    and 85:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The setting of rates will accomplish little in
    terms of public protection if the revenue can be stripped out of the company
    without any controls.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The OEB had evidence before it that THESL was
    paying increased dividends and an above market rate of interest while it was
    under investing by about $60 million in its capital expenditures. The OEB noted
    that if a utility like THESL was to pay all its retained earnings to its
    shareholder, this could adversely impact its credit rating, which in turn,
    could cause higher costs and degradation in service to electricity consumers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OEB also explained how it reached the conclusion
    that an appropriate response to the concerns raised by the substantial dividend
    payouts, was to require that any dividend paid by THESL be approved by a
    majority of its independent directors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the hearing, the composition of the
    board of directors of THESL was identical to the THC. The reasons reveal that
    the OEB was very concerned about the about the relationships between THESL,
    THC, and the City. For example, at para. 3.2.3 the OEB questioned the
    percentage of THC’s costs recovered from THESL:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is readily apparent to the Board that allocating
    these costs based on gross revenues produces an unwarranted bias against the
    ratepayers. The revenues of the utility are inflated by the high cost of
    wholesale power. That is an ever increasing amount. Because these costs are
    increasing, it does not follow the utility’s share of the overhead costs should
    be increasing. In short, there is no necessary relationship between the revenue
    share and the share of overhead cost. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons also discuss the above-market interest rate
    THESL was paying the THC on a loan (s. 5.3), as well as the purchase of the
    City’s street lighting business (para. 6.4.3). According to the OEB, the above-market
    interest rate resulted in THESL paying approximately an additional $16 million
    per year which was being borne by the ratepayers. Amplifying the concern was
    the City’s decision after the hearing, but before the decision was released, to
    extend the loan to 2013. This led the OEB to note at para. 5.3.8, it is
    “apparent that the financing decisions are being made unilaterally by the City,
    which is the sole shareholder of the utility.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to dividends, as already noted, the OEB
    was concerned about the very dramatic increase in the dividend payouts in 2004
    and 2005. At para. 5.3.18 the OEB stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Nor is it any
    defence to say this is not a decision of the utility but is being made
    unilaterally by the City of Toronto. That is exactly the problem. In fact it
    could be argued that this is part of a pattern. </i>The City has extracted
    extensive dividends from this utility in recent years. It is likely one of the
    rare occurrences in Canadian financial markets where the level of dividends
    exceeds the net income. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the OEB was aware of a change in a shareholder
    direction and the payment of special dividends. These facts are referred to in
    para. 6.4.2:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At one time, there was a shareholder direction that
    limited the dividend payout to 40% of the utility’s income, but that was
    changed to 50% of consolidated income. Moreover, it appears that were special
    dividends over and above that amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the OEB was of the opinion that one of the
    reasons for the THESL’s unusual dividend payouts was the THC’s, and ultimately
    the City’s, control over THESL’s decision making. The OEB explained at paras. 6.4.5
    and 6.4.6 of the decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A related question is the independence of the directors.
    The evidence in the hearing is that the directors of the utility and the
    parent, Toronto Hydro Corporation are currently identical. And none of the
    members of management are to be on the Board. This is an unusual situation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is a requirement that at least one third of
    the directors of the distributor must be independent but that rule will not
    apply to this utility until July 1, 2006. In the course of these hearings the
    utility has confirmed that it will comply with the requirement and at that time,
    the independent directors will be appointed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concern about affiliate transactions is not unique to
    THESL. The decision notes that there is extensive jurisprudence in gas cases
    with respect to transactions between a regulated utility and an affiliate
    (para. 5.3.17). The OEB has also established the <i>Affiliate Relationship Code for Electricity Distributors and
    Transmitters</i> (<span lang=EN-US>“</span><i>ARC</i>”) with a separate compliance
    procedure to guard against harm to ratepayers that may arise as a result of
    dealings between a utility and its affiliates. One of the provisions of the <i>ARC</i> required that one third of the board
    of directors of a distributor be independent from any affiliate by July 1, 2006.
    It is evident that independence is viewed as a guard against harmful decisions
    that arise as a result of dealings between a utility and its affiliates. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following this line of reasoning, the Board concluded
    at paras. 6.4.7 to 6.4.9 that the condition was needed to balance the interests
    of <i>both </i>the customer and the
    shareholder:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the unusual high level of dividend payout and
    the concern expressed by a number of parties, the Board believes that it is
    appropriate that any dividend paid by the utility to the City of Toronto should
    be approved by a majority of the independent directors. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Much of the controversy in this case has been
    dominated by discussion about non arms length transaction between the utility
    and the City of Toronto, whether it relates to dividend payouts, payment of
    interest on loans or the purchase of goods and services. <i>The introduction of independent directors will be a step in the right
    direction. The requirement that independent directors approve dividend payouts
    to affiliates will give the public greater assurance that the interests of
    ratepayers are not subservient to those of the shareholders.</i> The Board
    believes this is in keeping with the policy intent of Section 2 of the ARC.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This provision will be reviewed by the Board in the
    next rate case. At a minimum it will signal the Board’s serious concern with
    the state of inter-affiliate relations. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, this was a reasonable decision.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To reiterate, the second inquiry in a reasonableness
    analysis is that the decision fall “within a range of possible, acceptable
    outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.”  It is in this part of the analysis where, in
    my opinion, this court should address THESL’s argument that the imposed
    condition violated corporate law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THESL argued at the Divisional Court, and argues before
    this court, that the OEB order was contrary to settled principles of corporate
    law that the directors of a public company cannot delegate their power to
    declare dividends. Section 127(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) of the <i>OBCA </i>confirms this prohibition by
    expressly excluding any delegation of the board of directors’ power to declare
    a dividend from the general rule permitting delegation to a managing director or
    committee of directors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OEB submits that the authority to approve dividends
    was not taken away from the directors. Approval by the entire board is still
    required before a dividend can be issued. The independent directors are simply an
    additional check on the authority of the full board. The OEB also relies on s.
    128(1) of the Act which provides that, “[i]n the event of a conflict between this
    Act and any other general or special act, this Act prevails.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority judgment below accepted THESL’s argument,
    and found that the OEB had effectively delegated the power to declare dividends
    to the majority of the independent directors contrary to the <i>OBCA</i> and long-standing corporate law
    principles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In dissenting reasons, Lederman J. accepted the
    submission of the OEB – that the order leaves the discretion to declare a
