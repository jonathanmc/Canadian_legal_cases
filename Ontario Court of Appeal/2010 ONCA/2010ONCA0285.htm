    relating to inappropriate sexual conduct in relation to two young girls who
    were members of his family.  Six charges
    were withdrawn by the Crown.  Of the
    remaining seven, the appellant was convicted after a five-day trial by a judge
    and jury of two of the charges  one in relation to each complainant.  He was acquitted of the remaining charges.  </span></p>

    twelve.  The third argument is that the
    trial judges charge was deficient.  </span></p>

    assaulting his niece, SL, who was then 13 years old.  According to the Crowns evidence, SL and her
    sister NL, were sleeping together in the same bed when the appellant came in
    and touched SL inappropriately.  The
    appellant submits that since the jury was not satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that he had sexually assaulted SL on any of the occasions that formed the
    basis of the other counts relating to her, it was inconsistent of them to find
    he committed the acts that formed the basis of count ten. </span></p>

    the other verdicts having to do with the complainant, SL.  We note that there is no temporal connection
    among the events that form the basis of the various counts.  Moreover, although NLs account of the events
    differed from SLs, she provided evidence with respect to count ten in addition
    to that of SL.  No other corroborative
    evidence was presented in relation to any of the other counts relating to SL.  </span></p>

    being properly charged that they can believe all, some, or none of a witnesss
    testimony, to believe the evidence of SL about what happened in the bedroom
    that evening and to believe that part of NLs evidence that corroborated it, so
    as to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the inappropriate touching
    took place. </span></p>

    sexually assaulting another member of the family, JG who was approximately
    eleven years old at the time of the alleged conduct.  The appellant argues that the verdict was
    unreasonable because the evidence upon which the Crown relied was weak. Among
    other things, the appellant relies on the complainants inability to recall
    certain details such as the time of year, what she was wearing at the time and
    the number of times she was touched.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    establishing that the verdict is unreasonable.  The appellant must demonstrate that the verdict is one that no properly
    instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered. </span></p>

    Crowns case in relation to this count rested on the jurys assessment of the
    credibility of the appellant and of JG.  The jury was entitled to find JG credible and if so was entitled to also
    find that her evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt.  Regarding JGs difficulty in recollecting the
    details of the assault, it is important to bear in mind that this was an
    historic sexual assault, one that took place when JG was a young child.  </span></p>

    his obligation to put the theory of the defence to the jury.  This theory can be broken down into two
    parts  First, in relation to count ten,
    the defence relied on the inconsistencies between the descriptions SL and NL
    gave about what happened on the night in question.  The defence also relied on motive to
    fabricate; namely, the fact that in relation to both complainants the
    allegations of sexual assault against the appellant were in retaliation to
    accusations made by the appellants side of the family concerning another
    family member with whom they were more closely aligned.  The second factor involving motive related to
    JG only.  The appellant argued that JG
    made up the allegations against him out of anger and frustration due to his
    involvement in her mothers drinking.  </span></p>

    how to assess the adequacy of the charge.  The test is one of fairness.  The
    evidence must be put to the jury in a manner that will allow the jury to fully
    appreciate the issues and the defence presented.  Significantly, the charge must be considered
    in the context of the trial as a whole.   </span></p>

    jury did not set out the theory of the defence in a more fulsome fashion.  However, the trial judge did instruct the
    jury to be mindful of inconsistencies between the <span class=GramE>testimony</span> of various witnesses in that part of the charge where he dealt with assessing
    the testimony of witnesses.  He also made
    clear reference to the family dispute and that reference included mention of
    the problems associated with alcohol.  The trial was short, the issues were uncomplicated and the Crown and
    defence counsel gave thorough addresses to the jury just prior to the charge.  </span></p>
