  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 19, 2007, Justice H. Chisvin of the
    Ontario Court of Justice (the “trial judge”) granted an order under the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>staying
    the proceedings against Davood Zarinchang (the “respondent”) on the ground that
    the judicial system failed to provide the respondent with a bail hearing for
    some 24 days from the time of his arrest.  The trial judge further ordered the Crown to pay the costs of the
    respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown appeals the stay order and seeks leave
    to appeal the costs order.  The Crown
    also seeks to introduce fresh evidence on appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in
    finding that the 24-day delay was occasioned by insufficient institutional
    resources.  The Crown also submits that
    the trial judge failed to apply properly the governing principles for
    concluding that there was a <i>Charter</i> breach and in determining a stay of proceedings and a costs order were
    appropriate remedies.  </p>
  <h2>THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On March 31, 2007, the respondent was arrested
    and charged with a number of offences arising out of disputes with his girlfriend.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  He was immediately taken into custody.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent first appeared in bail court on
    April 1, 2007.  His parents attended
    court and were available to act as sureties.  He had not yet retained counsel and was assisted by legal aid duty
    counsel.  Counsel representing the Crown
    took the position that because the parents were potential witnesses to the
    alleged offences, they would not be acceptable sureties.  Duty counsel, without instructions from the
    respondent, requested that the matter be put over to April 3, 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent returned to bail court on April
    3, 2007, represented by a law student who was instructed by her principal to
    attempt to negotiate a consent release.  If she was unable to achieve that result, she was instructed to ask the
    respondent if he wished to proceed to a bail hearing with the assistance of
    duty counsel.  The respondent’s mother
    and his employer were present in court and prepared to act as sureties.  His father, although not present in court,
    was available to attend on short notice if required.  The Crown advised the law student that he was
    not prepared to consent to the respondent’s release.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent chose to proceed with a
    show-cause hearing with the assistance of duty counsel.  However, duty counsel advised the law student
    that the matter would not be reached that day as other cases with higher
    priority were waiting to be heard.  The law
    student requested an adjournment to April 12, 2007, the first date that would
    accom-modate the schedules of counsel and potential sureties for the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 12, 2007, the respondent was
    represented by counsel.  Potential
    sureties were again present.  They waited
    all day to be reached.  Late in the day,
    counsel made the following statement to the justice of the peace:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The other gentleman in the box is Mr.
    Zarinchang.  He is up for bail hearing
    today.  He is in custody since the 31<sup>st</sup> of March and had a number of people here.  I am private counsel and I have been here all day as well.  I certainly heed Your Honour’s comments that
    you made about an hour ago about not wanting to start a contested hearing at 4:00,
    it is 4:25.  It is a reverse onus but
    despite that it is certainly my submission that this is a very strong matter
    for bail.  I will be urging the Court to
    grant bail but the Crown is not in a position to consent to the release and it
    is 4:25.  I don’t know what else I could
    say.  Certainly it is my wish as it has
    been all day – the Zarinchangs and he <span class=GramE>has</span> got about
    six people here for him – to have proceeded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The justice of the peace adjourned the case to
    April 17, 2007, when the sureties were next available.  He advised the Crown to “note it for some
    type of priority on that date.”  However,
    the justice of the peace observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I know that there is no guarantee that the matter
    will be heard depending on where he is and the list of priorities.  <u>I know that there are some other persons
    that have been in custody as long perhaps, maybe even longer than he has</u> so
    the Crown – I am sure the Crown will do their best to call the list. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 17, 2007, the respondent again appeared
    in court with counsel and potential sureties.  The Crown, on the other hand, was not prepared to proceed: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Well I can pretty well say it is not going to happen
    because I already have three youth releases and I have three adult releases and
    I have a contested with counsel and surety present.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  It was
    agreed to wait and see if another court might become available to hear the
    matter.  Later in the day, it was clear
    that the matter could not be heard that day:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:            Mr.
    Morische, first of all how long has your client been in custody?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. MORISCHE:     He
    was arrested on the 30<sup>th</sup> of March [<i>sic</i>] and has been up <span style='"Times New Roman"'>—</span> … <span style='"Times New Roman"'>—</span> this is now the
    fourth appearance for bail where the surety is here but<span class=GramE>… .</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:            <span
class=GramE>Four times that sureties</span> have been available here?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. MORISCHE:     Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:            Is
    it the Crown’s position to proceed with the bail hearing today?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MS. ELMASRY:       No
    I am not willing to proceed at this time.  It is not a matter that would be a short matter and at this time, given
    the time of day all I can say is if you adjourned it until tomorrow, traverse
    it to 106 Court.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:            Right.  The Crown is not in a position to proceed
    now.  It is almost four thirty and again <u>you
    have heard me say it before, that it really isn’t an acceptable state of
    affairs but we don’t have the time to deal with the matters that come before us</u> and Ms. Elmasry has agreed to mark this for priority tomorrow.  Are the sureties available tomorrow morning
    Mr. Morische?  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent conceded that he had
    no choice but to come back the following day – April 18, 2007.  However, he advised the court that he could
    not guarantee he would have sureties available.  The two people whom he had available on April 17 were not available on
    short notice the following day.  However,
    he would do his best to find others who could act as sureties on April 18,
    2007.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 18, 2007, the respondent and counsel
    again attended court and counsel made the following statement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The reason we cannot proceed today is the absence of
    our sureties.  This on four previous
    occasions, Mr. Zarinchang has had sureties present between four and six
    individuals, including his parents who are self-employed and his employer who
    have all taken time off work.  He has had
    counsel representation I believe on three of those occasions who have spent the
    entirety of a day <span class=GramE>awaiting</span> to have this bail hearing
    heard.  Because of the nature of the
    lists, in this Court, because of the lack of resources I think is the only
    explanation, he has been unable to do that.  <span class=GramE>Despite having been marked a priority, and despite our
    best efforts.</span>  Today there is a
    second bail Court where he has been placed as a priority however I have been
    informed by the sureties that they simply cannot return this many times within
    that specified period without essentially ruinous financial loss.  As a result and through no will of ours, he
    is going to be adjourned. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo>The case was adjourned to April 24, 2007, when the bail hearing
    proceeded.  The respondent was denied
    bail and detained.</p>
  <h2>THE <i>CHARTER</i> APPLICATION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent brought an
    application before the trial judge on September 27, 2007 and October 9, 2007
    for an order staying the charges against him.  The respondent alleged that a 24-day delay in the hearing of his bail
    application violated his rights under ss. 7, 9 and 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge had available to him the
    transcripts of the various attendances at bail court except for a complete
    transcript of the bail hearing.  Counsel
    for the respondent also filed on consent a letter dated June 25, 2007 from Paul
    Tait, the Crown Attorney for York Region, which advised that a committee had
    been established a year earlier to consider a number of serious issues
    regarding the efficient operation of bail courts, including problems with delay.  The committee included members of the bench
    and bar, court officials, security staff and a representative of the Regional
    Senior Justice of the Peace.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent filed an affidavit of
    a law student, which provided additional factual information concerning the
    various appearances at bail court in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the trial judge was provided with the
    following statistical information:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That York Region, for which the only court is in
    Newmarket, has a population of just <span class=GramE>under</span> 1 million people;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The court house in Newmarket runs 7 bail courts a
    week;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Brampton Court House, which serves a population
    of just over 1 million people, runs 15 bail courts a week;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The City of Toronto, which population exceeds 2.2
    million, runs 35 adult bail courts and 15 youth bail courts a week;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Durham Region, a region whose population is
    approximately 2/3 the size of York Region runs 5 bail courts a week.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge defined the issue before him as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As I said at the outset, this is not a case about
    police misconduct or with the police failing to comply with <i>Criminal Code</i> sections.  This case is about whether or not other
    governmental institutions <span class=GramE>who</span> are responsible for
    providing court resources provided sufficient resources to allow the applicant
    to have a show cause hearing and be dealt with as required by law.  It is important to recognize that the
    applicant was indeed prepared to proceed on one or more occasions with his show
    cause hearing but <u>it was lack of institutional <span class=GramE>resources,
    that</span> is court space, which prevented his application from being heard</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The time period that the applicant experienced here
    far exceeded what would be or should be acceptable.  The Crown contends that this occurred as a
    result of a culmination of events that led to the creation of a perfect
    storm.  Even if I were to accept that
    submission, which I do not, this perfect storm was a predictable storm that
    could have been avoided by proper preparation and management.  The applicant should not be left to flounder
    on the seas of <u>neglect by those responsible for ensuring sufficient
    resources exist</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Planning and foresight would have taken care of this
    problem.  Indeed this was not the first
    time that this concern was raised in the Newmarket Court House.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge regularly sits in the region where
    the application was heard.  He observed
    that York Region had lagged behind other jurisdictions in the Greater Toronto
    Area in respect of judicial resources available to deal with cases of this
    nature.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, on the face of the matter it is clear that
    as this jurisdiction has grown, resources have not kept up with the
    demand.  Indeed, it is also obvious on a
    proportionate basis to other jurisdictions in the Greater Toronto <span
class=GramE>Area,</span> York Region has not kept up with resources available
    in other courts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, the trial judge concluded
    that the breach of <i>Charter</i> rights in
    this case was “very significant”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of remedy, he rejected the Crown’s
    submission that enhanced credit for the 24 days in custody applied against
    sentence would be sufficient.  The trial
    judge, quite properly, noted that the respondent might be found not guilty and
    hence such a remedy would be no remedy at all.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also considered the Crown’s
    submission that a stay of proceedings would not be appropriate because, at the
    end of the day, the respondent was detained at the conclusion of his bail
    hearing.  He dismissed this position as “an
    end justifies the means argument” and not relevant to the assertion of the
    respondent’s fundamental <i>Charter</i> rights.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that the
    only appropriate remedy for this serious and flagrant breach of the
    respondent’s <i>Charter</i> rights was a
    stay of proceedings against him: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When the breach of the applicant’s rights here are
    considered, it can only be described as serious and flagrant, those responsible
    have effectively ignored the impending reality and disaster that was
    afoot.  Individuals have been allowed to
    languish in custody awaiting show cause hearings.  The serious nature of this matter could only
    be remedied by the most significant remedy available, that being a stay of the
    charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ordered costs against the Crown
    as an additional <i>Charter</i> remedy.  He was of the view that it was reasonable for
    the respondent to bear his own costs incurred before April 12, 2007.  He therefore calculated the cost of counsel
    attending court on three subsequent days at $1,200.00 a day for a total of $3,600.  The trial judge allowed $200 an hour for 30
    hours of preparation of the <i>Charter</i> argument – an additional $6,000.  Finally, he allowed $2,000 for the argument of the application.  Thus, the total costs awarded against the
    Crown were $11,600 plus GST and disbursements of $350.  </p>
  <h2>THE FRESH EVIDENCE APPLICATION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the appeal, counsel for the appellant sought
    to enter as fresh evidence an affidavit of Assistant Crown Attorney, Meghan
    Scott.  Ms. Scott prosecuted a case against
    the respondent in Toronto for unrelated charges concerning the possession of a
    loaded firearm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Scott deposed to the details of certain
    discussions between counsel at judicial pre-trial conferences in February,
    March and April 2007.  These discussions led
    to the respondent’s guilty plea to certain of the Toronto charges on April 25,
    2007.  The respondent was ultimately
    sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 11 months. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We pause to note that plea negotiations are
    generally privileged in the sense that the information disclosed will not be
    used against the accused, although there may be exceptions: <i>R. v. Bernardo</i>, [1994] O.J. No. 1718
    (S.C.).  It may be that an exception
    applies where the negotiations are adduced to rebut an allegation of prejudice
    at the hands of the Crown.  However, we
    make no further comment as this issue was not addressed by either party.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown seeks to rely on this evidence to
    correct a statement made by defence counsel (not Mr. Schreck) on the <i>Charter</i> application.  Defence counsel advised the trial judge on the <i>Charter</i> application that the
    respondent decided to enter a plea to the Toronto charges after the detention
    order was made in Newmarket on April 24, 2007.  The Crown submits, in effect, that defence counsel misled the trial
    judge by suggesting that there was a causal link between the detention order in
    Newmarket and the decision to plead to the Toronto charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown further submits that based on defence
    counsel’s statement to the trial judge one might conclude that the guilty plea
    to the Toronto charges was an act of desperation by a man “out of time, money
    and steam, [so] he made the best he could of a bad and unfair situation.”  It is the Crown’s position that “the fresh
    evidence is capable of vitiating entirely or diminishing the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> violation, or at least the
    level of derivative prejudice, and certainly would affect the determination of
    any remedy”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent submits there is
    nothing in the fresh evidence to establish a causal link between the detention
    order in Newmarket and the guilty plea to the Toronto charges.  He argues that at no time did counsel suggest
    to the trial judge that, but for the detention order, the respondent would not
    have pleaded guilty.  Counsel did not
    advance an argument that his client was “out of time, money and steam”.  The reference to the guilty plea to the
    Toronto charges was by way of explanation as to why he did not apply for a bail
    review as it would have no practical benefit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent points out that the
    trial judge did not find that the detention order caused the respondent to
    plead guilty to the Toronto charges.  Indeed, no reference is made to the guilty plea in the trial judge’s
    reasons for judgment.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree with the submissions of counsel for the
    respondent.  This case does not turn on
    the issue of the timing of the decision to plead guilty to the Toronto charges,
    which is not relevant.  Also, we are not
    persuaded that the fresh evidence satisfies the four-part test in <i>R. v. Palmer and Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    759.  In particular, the evidence does
    not satisfy the second and fourth parts of the <i>Palmer</i> test; it does not, in our view, bear upon a decisive issue
    in the case and could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We dismiss the application to admit the fresh

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For convenience, the relevant provisions of the <i>Charter</i> provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>7.        Everyone has the right to life, liberty
    and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in
    accordance with the principles of funda-mental justice.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>9.        Everyone has the right not to be
    arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>11.      Any person charged with an offence has the
    right…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (e)  <span class=GramE>not</span> to be denied reasonable bail without just
    cause.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The importance of s. 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i> was clearly expressed by
    Iacobucci J., dissenting, in <i>R. v. Hall</i>,
    [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309 at paras. 47-49:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At the heart of a free and democratic society is the
    liberty of its subjects.  Liberty lost is
    never regained and can never be fully compensated for; therefore, where the
    potential exists for the loss of freedom for even a day, we, as a free and
    democratic society, must place the highest emphasis on ensuring that our system
    of justice minimizes the chances of an unwarranted denial of liberty.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the context of the criminal law, this fundamental
    freedom is embodied generally in the right to be presumed innocent until proven
    guilty, and further in the specific right to bail.  When bail is denied to an individual who is
    merely <u>accused</u> of a criminal offence, the presumption of innocence is
    necessarily infringed.  This is the
    context of this appeal, one in which the “golden thread” that runs through our
    system of criminal law is placed in jeopardy.  And this is the context in which laws authorizing pre-trial detention
    must be scrutinized.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 11(<i>e</i>)
    of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</i> calls particularly on courts, as guardians of liberty, to ensure
    that pre-trial release remains the norm rather than the exception to the norm,
    and to restrict pre-trial detention to only those circumstances where the
    fundamental rights and freedoms of the accused must be overridden in order to
    preserve some demonstrably pressing societal interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a speech to the Criminal Lawyers’ Association
    on November 28, 2009, our colleague, Justice Marc Rosenberg, referred to
    Professor Friedland’s 1965 report on the bail system in Toronto.  Professor Friedland said that “the law should
    abhor any unnecessary deprivation of liberty and positive steps should be taken
    to ensure that detention before trial is kept to a minimum.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unreasonably prolonged custody awaiting a bail
    hearing gives rise to a breach of s. 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>: see, for example, <i>R.
    v. V<span class=GramE>.(</span>J.)</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 507 (Ont. S.C.).  In this case, s. 503(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> required that
    the respondent be taken before a justice without unreasonable delay and in any
    event within 24 hours of his arrest.  Section 516(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> permitted an adjournment for no more than three clear days, except
    with the consent of the respondent.</p>
  <h2>(i)        Was
    the sole cause of the delay systemic?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel submits that that neither the
    Crown nor the justice of the peace was made aware of the respondent’s desire to
    proceed more quickly until April 12.  He argues
    that on April 3, the law student, representing the respondent, simply requested
    an adjournment to April 12 and said nothing more.  The Crown, he argues, was not part of the
    discussion in which the duty counsel advised that the case could not be reached
    that day and thus could not have known that the respondent wished to be heard
    that day.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept that the conduct of either the
    law student or the duty counsel was a contributing factor to the delay.  The respondent was present with his sureties
    and ready to proceed.  But for the lack
    of court resources, the bail hearing would have proceeded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During oral argument, counsel for the appellant
    submitted that defence counsel could have explored other dates for a bail
    hearing, particularly Wednesday dates, when two bail courts were in operation
    in Newmarket.  With respect, there simply
    was no evidence before the trial judge that the bail hearing could have been
    heard any earlier than it was. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, as was observed by Cromwell J. in <i>R. v. Godin</i> (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 271
    (S.C.C.) at para. 23 in the context of <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> case, defence counsel are not
    required “to hold themselves in a state of perpetual availability.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown’s position also fails to recognize the
    right of an accused to a prompt bail hearing and the responsibility of the
    Crown to see that it happens.  In <i>V<span class=GramE>.(</span>J.)</i> at para.
    66, Hill J. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where a person, arrested and detained for a bail
    hearing, is taken before the court within twenty-four hours of arrest (<i>Code</i> s. 503(1)), and the prosecution and
    the accused are prepared for a show cause hearing, a hearing should forthwith
    be held whenever possible.  In a
    jurisdiction such as this, serving a population of nearly one million persons,
    bail courts run seven days a week.  <u>An
    arrested person should not face the prospect of having to, in <span
class=GramE>effect,</span> make an appointment for his or her bail hearing</u>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, there was more than sufficient
    evidence to support the trial judge’s finding of systemic delay.  On April 3, 2007, there were other cases that
    were given priority to this case.  On
    April 12, 2007, the justice of the peace observed that “there are some other
    persons that have been in custody as long perhaps, even longer than he has”.  On April 17, 2007, the justice of the peace
    said, “[Y]ou have heard me say it before, that it really isn’t an appropriate
    state of affairs but we don’t have the time to deal with the matters that come
    before us”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also considered that the Crown Attorney
    for the region was sufficiently concerned about the systemic problems that he
    established a committee to address the issue.  In addition, the trial judge considered the evidence concerning the
    number of bail courts in York Region compared to other regions in the Greater
    Toronto Area.  York Region had one half
    the weekly bail courts of Peel, which had roughly the same population and
    proportionately fewer bail courts than Toronto or Durham Region.  All of this evidence supported the trial
    judge’s conclusion that there was a very significant problem of systemic delay
    in York Region in the hearing of bail applications.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the case at bar, the respondent was in court
    with his sureties and ready to proceed on April 1, 3, 12 and 17.  The system failed him.  This failure constituted a serious violation
    of the respondent’s constitutional rights.  </p>
  <h2>(ii)       Did
    the trial judge err in granting a stay of proceedings?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We begin with a discussion of the legal
    principles as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada that govern the
    granting of a stay of proceedings pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  A useful starting point is <i>R. v.
    O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411.  In
    that case, the trial judge granted a stay of proceedings against the accused for
    the failure of the Crown to fulfill its disclosure obligations concerning the
    medical records of the complainants in respect of a number of sexual
    offences.  The British Columbia Court of
    Appeal set aside the stay and ordered a new trial.  The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the
    appeal by the accused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>O’Connor</i>,
    L’Heureux-Dub<span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> J.,
    writing for herself, La Forest and Gonthier JJ., stated that a stay of
    proceedings is an exceptional remedy to be employed as a last resort, only after
    canvassing other available remedies.  L’Heureux-Dub<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> J. noted at para. 73
    that in <i>Charter</i> cases “concern for
    the individual rights of the accused may be accompanied by concerns about the
    integrity of the judicial system.”  She
    further added: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In addition, there is a residual category of conduct
    caught by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  This residual category does not relate to
    conduct affecting the fairness of the trial or impairing other procedural
    rights enumerated in the <i>Charter</i>, but
    instead addresses the panoply of diverse and sometimes unforeseeable
    circumstances in which a prosecution is conducted in such a manner as to
    connote unfairness or vexatiousness of such a degree that it contravenes
    funda-mental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the
    judicial process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Canada
    (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391,
    a Federal Court judge granted a stay of citizenship revocation proceedings
    taken against three Canadian citizens.  The trial judge held that a reasonable person would conclude that the
    judicial independence of the court had been infringed by reason of an <i>ex parte</i> meeting between the Chief
    Justice of the Federal Court and an assistant deputy attorney general.  The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the
    appeal, holding that there was no reasonable apprehension of interference with
    judicial independence.  The subsequent
    appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Tobiass</i>,
    the court observed at para. 89 that a stay is usually granted to cure some
    “unfairness to the individual that has resulted from state misconduct”.  However, the court then confirmed that there
    is a residual category of cases for which a stay may be an appropriate remedy
    and referred to para. 73 of the reasons of L’Heureux-Dub<span style='"Times New Roman"'>é J. in <i>O’Connor</i>.  The court in <i>Tobiass</i> emphasized that the residual category of cases is small.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court continued at para. 90 to hold that in either
    case – where the Crown has rendered the proceedings unfair or has acted in such
    a way as to adversely affect the integrity of the administration of justice
    (the residual category) – two criteria must be satisfied:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated or
    aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of the above criteria, the court said
    at para. 91:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The first criterion is critically important.  It reflects the fact that a stay of
    proceedings is a prospective remedy.  A
    stay of proceedings does not redress a wrong that has already been done.  It aims to prevent the perpetuation of a
    wrong that, if left alone, will continue to trouble the parties and the
    community as a whole in the future.  See <i>O’Connor</i>, at para. 82.  For this reason, the first criterion must be
    satisfied even in cases involving conduct that falls into the residual
    category.  See <i>O’Connor</i>, at para. 75.  The
    mere fact that the state has treated an individual shabbily in the past is not
    enough to warrant a stay of proceedings.  For a stay of proceedings to be appropriate in a case falling into the
    residual category, it must appear that the state misconduct is likely to
    continue in the future or that the carrying forward of the prosecution will
    offend society’s sense of justice.  Ordinarily, the latter condition will not be met unless the former is as
    well – society will not take umbrage at the carrying forward of a prosecution unless
    it is likely that some form of misconduct will continue.  There may be exceptional cases in which the
    past misconduct is so egregious that the mere fact of going forward in the
    light of it will be offensive.  But such
    cases should be relatively very rare.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the court suggested that there may be a
    third criterion where it is not clear that the abuse in question is sufficient
    to warrant a stay.  In such cases, “it
    will be appropriate to balance the interests that would be served by the
    granting of a stay of proceedings against the interest that society has in
    having a final decision on the merits”: see <i>Tobiass</i> at para. 92.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R. v.
    Regan</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, the court reiterated the principles articulated
    in <i>O’Connor</i> and <i>Tobiass</i>.  In <i>Regan</i>, the trial judge stayed nine
    counts of sex-related offences on the basis that certain prosecutorial abuse
    would continue to taint the trial.  He
    relied on the residual category.  A
    majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the trial
    judge.  The Supreme Court, in a five-four
    split, dismissed the appeal.  In
    considering the approach to cases in the residual category, Lebel J., for the
    majority, said at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As discussed above, most cases of abuse of process
    will cause prejudice by rendering the trial unfair.  Under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, however, a small residual category of abusive action
    exists which does not affect trial fairness, but still undermines the
    fundamental justice of the system (<i>O’Connor</i>,
    at para. 73).  Yet even in these cases,
    the important prospective nature of the stay as a remedy must still be
    satisfied: “[t]<span class=GramE>he</span> mere fact that the state has treated
    an individual shabbily in the past is not enough to warrant a stay of
    proceedings” (<i>Tobiass</i>, at para.
    91).  When dealing with an abuse which
    falls into the residual category, generally speaking, a stay of proceedings is
    only appropriate when the abuse is likely to continue or be carried
    forward.  Only in “exceptional”,
    “relatively very rare” cases will the past misconduct be “so egregious that the
    mere fact of going forward in the light of it will be offensive” (<i>Tobiass</i>, at para. 91).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court also emphasized that where a judge may
    be uncertain as to whether the abuse is sufficient to warrant a stay, a
    traditional balancing of interests should take place: see <i>Regan</i> at para. 57.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From the above cases in the Supreme Court, the
    following principles emerge:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)
    There are two categories of cases that may attract a stay of proceedings. The
    first category implicates the fairness of an individual’s trial resulting from
    state misconduct.  The second involves a
    residual category unrelated to the fairness of the trial, but involves state
    conduct that contravenes fundamental notions of justice, which undermines the
    integrity of the judicial process. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)
    In considering whether to grant a stay of proceedings under either of the above
    categories, the following criteria must be satisfied:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated or
    aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; it must be
    directed at prospective prejudice, not to redress past prejudice; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
class=GramE>no</span> other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    cases in either of the above categories where there remains some uncertainty as
    to whether the abuse is sufficiently serious to create the prejudice to warrant
    a stay, there is a third criterion that the court may consider – the balancing
    of the interests in granting a stay against society’s interest in  having a trial on the merits. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where the residual category is engaged, a court
    will generally find it necessary to perform the balancing exercise referred to in
    the third criterion.  When a stay is
    sought for a case on the basis of the residual category, there will not be a
    concern about continuing prejudice to the applicant by proceeding with the
    prosecution.  Rather, the concern is for
    the integrity of the justice system.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the problem giving rise to the stay
    application is systemic in nature, the reason a stay is ordered is to address the
    prejudice to the justice system from allowing the prosecution to proceed at the
    same time as the systemic problem, to which the accused was subjected, continues.  In effect, a stay of the charge against an
    accused in the residual category of cases is the price the system pays to
    protect its integrity.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the “residual category” is not an
    open-ended means for courts to address ongoing systemic problems.  In some sense, an accused who is granted a
    stay under the residual category realizes a windfall.  Thus, it is important to consider if the
    price of the stay of a charge against a particular accused is worth the
    gain.  Does the advantage of staying the
    charges against this accused outweigh the interest in having the case decided
    on the merits?  In answering that
    question, a court will almost inevitably have to engage in the type of
    balancing exercise that is referred to in the third criterion.  It seems to us that a court will be required
    to look at the particulars of the case, the circumstances of the accused, the
    nature of the charges he or she <span class=GramE>faces,</span> the interest of
    the victim and the broader interest of the community in having the particular
    charges disposed of on the merits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, in our view, a strong case can be made
    that courts should engage in the balancing exercise set out in the third
    criterion in most cases coming within the residual category.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We now return to the case on appeal and the
    application of the above principles.  In our
    view, this case falls into the residual category.  There is no evidence that the abuse suffered
    by the respondent in respect of the denial of his right to a timely bail
    hearing would have an effect on his right to a fair trial.  However, as the court said in <i>Tobiass</i> at para. 91, which we repeat for
    emphasis:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For a stay of proceedings to be appropriate in a
    case falling in the residual category, it must appear that the state misconduct
    is likely to continue in the future or that the carrying forward of the
    prosecution will offend society’s sense of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, it appears that the systemic
    failure of the bail system in York Region found by the trial judge would likely
    continue to affect others in the future unless some appropriate action was
    taken.  However, the question that arises
    is whether continuing the prosecution against the respondent in this
    circumstance would create prejudice to the system of justice that warrants the
    use of a stay.  In our view, there is an
    element of uncertainty about the answer to this question.  That being the case, the third criterion
    articulated in the above cases comes into play – a court should then balance
    the interests served by the granting of a stay against the interest served by a
    trial on the merits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, the reasons of the trial judge do
    not suggest that he undertook the balancing exercise.  That failure in our view is critical and
    leads us to conclude that the stay must be set aside.  In fairness to the trial judge, counsel on
    the application for a stay did not submit that he undertake such an
    exercise.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While it may be open to this court, in an
    appropriate case, to undertake the balancing exercise when none has been
    undertaken in the court below, we would not do so on the record before us.  While we have the evidence concerning the
    systemic failure and the serious consequences it had for persons in custody
    awaiting bail in York Region, the record is unhelpful in respect of other
    interests that are relevant to the balancing exercise.  Although the transcript of the bail hearing
    contains some information that would ordinarily be required for the balancing
    exercise, much of it was challenged by the respondent.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It may be that a stay of the charges against this
    respondent is an appropriate price for society to pay in order to correct a
    serious systemic failure in the bail system in York Region.  However, it is only after a proper balancing
    of the appropriate interests is undertaken that a court could come to that
    conclusion.  We observe in passing that the
    trial judge’s order appears to have caused the authorities in York Region to
    take some steps to address the problem.  Counsel for the Crown in the court below conceded during the costs
    hearing that since the trial judge had ordered the stay of proceedings “we have
    now been running a second bail court here five days a week, which will
    obviously have significant benefit to other accused going forward.”      </p>
  <h2>(iii)     Did
    the trial judge err in making a costs order against the Crown?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We accept that it is rare for costs to be
    awarded in a criminal case.  In <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i>, [2001] 3
    S.C.R. 575 at para. 87, McLachlin C.J. stated for the court that costs in a criminal
    case are only appropriate where it can be shown that there was “a marked and
    unacceptable departure from the reasonable standards expected of the
    prosecution”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R. v.
    Brown</i> (2009), 247 C.C.C. (3d) 11, this court upheld a costs award made in
    respect of a bail delay case.  <i>Brown</i> involved a situation, where, after
    a lengthy investigation into allegations of gang-related trafficking and acts
    of extensive violence, the Toronto police conducted a major take down and
    arrested approximately 100 individuals.  The
    arrested persons were not taken before a justice of the peace within 24 hours
    as required by s. 503(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  No arrangements had been made
    to have adequate resources available in the bail courts to deal with the
    situation in a single day.  Dates for
    bail hearings were set well beyond the three day adjournment permitted by s.
    516(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On applications for <i>habeas corpus</i>, brought by several of the accused persons, the
    application judge found violations of their rights under ss. 503(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) and s. 516(1).  The application judge also found breaches of ss. 7, 9 and 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The application judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is simply no excuse for the court system not
    to be ready to properly process these people and in a manner that ensures that
    their fundamental rights are respected.  All that is required is a reasonable amount of attention and planning,
    along with a degree of advance notice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge did not grant <i>habeas corpus</i> but ordered expedited bail
    hearings.  In addition, he ordered costs
    against the Crown pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The Crown appealed
    the costs order.  Sharpe J.A., writing
    for this court, said at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I do not accept the appellant’s central submission
    before us that the application judge failed to make the findings required to
    bring the Crown’s conduct within the category of “a marked and unacceptable
    departure from the reasonable standards expected of the prosecution”.  In my view, the findings by the application
    judge bring this case within that standard as it applies to cases involving the
    violation of <i>Charter</i> rights….The
    application judge rested his decision to award costs on the basis of a systemic
    failure on the part of the prosecution to respect both the statutory and <i>Charter</i> rights of the respondents.  Those findings were fully supported by the
    record.  He aptly described the conduct
    of the Crown and the situation it produced as “improper and unacceptable.”  The cause of that improper and unacceptable
    situation was the failure of the Crown to make the necessary arrangements to
    have sufficient court resources available to deal with the known fact that
    there would be a massive intake of detained persons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We would apply the same reasoning to the trial
    judge’s award of costs of $3,600 for counsel’s attendances in bail court caused
    by the failure of the system.  We would
    not interfere with the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to award these costs.  In this case, the systemic problem of delay
    was recognized in York Region for some time – at least a year and no doubt for
    some time before the regional Crown Attorney found it necessary to appoint a
    committee to study the matter.  The
    circumstances in which the respondent was placed were entirely
    predictable.  The record demonstrates
    that many others were similarly affected.  This is one of those rare cases where a costs award was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, in view of the order we make setting
    aside the stay of proceedings, we set aside the balance of the trial judge’s
    award of costs.  </p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We set aside the order granting a stay and order
    a new trial, but without prejudice to the respondent’s ability to renew his
    application for <i>Charter</i> relief,
    including a stay, if so advised.  We
    grant leave to appeal the costs order and make an adjustment to the award by
    reducing the total award from $11,600 to $3,600 plus G.S.T.</p>
