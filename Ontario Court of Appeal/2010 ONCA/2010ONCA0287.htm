style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This appeal arises from a claim by the appellant against his
    former law firm concerning the appellant’s remuneration.  The claim is based upon allegations of breach
    of contract, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust
    enrichment.  The trial judge gave very
    thorough and detailed reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence and for
    dismissing the claim. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On this appeal, the appellant focuses exclusively on an issue
    that, according to the trial judge, was raised for the first time during
    closing argument, namely: did the respondent owe and breach a fiduciary duty to
    inform the appellant of where he “fit” under a new firm compensation system to
    be implemented in 2002 and to warn the appellant that his remuneration as a
    partner would be significantly reduced under that system.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the respondent owed and breached
    that duty and that he thereby suffered a loss.  This contention rests on the theory that had he been warned that his
    compensation would be significantly reduced, he would have withdrawn from the
    partnership earlier and received a higher payout based on his 2001 allocation
    of partnership units.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that in the light of the terms of the
    partnership agreement, the respondent did not owe the appellant a fiduciary
    duty in relation to decisions made by the firm’s executive committee as to the
    appellant`s compensation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We agree with that finding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>With respect to the specific issues raised before us on this
    appeal, the trial judge found that:</span></p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'><span
style='line-height:150%'>1.    <span class=GramE>the</span> respondent did not owe the appellant
    the asserted fiduciary duty;</span></p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>2.    <span class=GramE>even</span> if there was such a duty, the
    appellant had failed to prove that that duty had been breached; and</span></p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>3.    <span class=GramE>in</span> any event, the appellant was well aware
    of the likelihood that his share of partnership units and, hence, his income
    from the firm would be significantly lower in 2002.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred with respect
    to any of these findings.</span></p>
  <h3><i>1. Was there a fiduciary duty?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We have already referred to the trial judge’s overall finding
    that the respondent owed the appellant no fiduciary duty in relation to the
    determination of his level of remuneration.  The appellant does not challenge that finding. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Nothing in the <i>Partnerships
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.5 or in the partnership agreement between these
    parties imposes such a duty on the management of the respondent law firm.  Moreover, no such duty arises at common law. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant relies on undertakings by the firm’s executive
    committee that the managing partner would meet with each partner to review that
    partner`s likely level of income under the new compensation system. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We do not agree that these undertakings gave rise to a
    fiduciary duty.  It is well-established
    that not every statement or act made or done in the context of a fiduciary
    relationship gives rise to a fiduciary duty.  Further, not every legal claim arising out of a
    fiduciary relationship will give rise to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  See <i>Galambos
    v. Perez</i> 2009 SCC 28, at paras. 36-7<span class=GramE>.  In</span> our view, the statements or
    undertakings relied on by the appellant amounted to nothing more than ordinary
    administrative steps taken by the firm’s executive committee in the management
    of the partnership. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, we see no basis on which to interfere with the
    trial judge`s finding that no fiduciary duty of the kind asserted by the
    appellant was owed to him.</span></p>
  <h3><i>2. If there was a fiduciary duty, was that duty
    breached?</i><i></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Nor do we see any basis to interfere with the trial judge’s
    conclusion than even if there was a fiduciary duty, the appellant failed to
    establish a breach of that duty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant testified that he met with the firm’s managing
    partner (who died shortly before the appellant commenced this action) in
    February 2001, shortly after the <span class=GramE>units</span> allocation for
    2001 was announced.  The appellant
    testified that the managing partner indicated her wish to conduct a formal
    interview with him as contemplated by the memorandum that had been sent to all
    partners in that regard, to explain to him where he would “fit” in the new
    compensation system.  The appellant claimed
    that the managing partner told him that he would fit at the highest level under
    the new system. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge gave detailed reasons for rejecting the
    appellant’s evidence and found as a fact that the appellant had not been
    promised the level of remuneration he alleged.  The appellant does not challenge that finding
    of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The respondent invited the trial judge to find that the
    managing partner had in fact told the appellant that his performance meant that
    his units would be dramatically reduced in 2002.  While the trial judge found there was much to
    be said for this submission, in the end he was unable to draw the inference
    sought by the respondent. However, the trial judge also explicitly refused to
    make any finding that the managing partner had failed to warn the appellant
    that his 2002 allocation of partnership units was likely to be significantly lower
    than his 2001 allocation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We are unable to accept the submission that evidence of
    conversations the appellant had with other members of the firm’s executive
    committee undermine the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant had failed
    to establish that the managing partner had not warned him about the likely
    level of his 2002 income.  The relevant
    memoranda from the executive committee clearly state that the meeting to
    discuss the implications of the new compensation system was to be with the
    managing partner.  It is the appellant’s
    evidence that he in fact met with the managing partner.  Given the trial judge’s overall negative
    assessment of the appellant’s credibility and his outright rejection of the
    appellant’s account of what the managing partner told him at that meeting, it
    was clearly open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant had failed
    to satisfy him that she had not told the appellant that his units allocation
    would be significantly reduced in 2002 and that, as a result, the appellant had
    not satisfied the onus he bore of proving any breach of the alleged fiduciary
    duty. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We note, in this regard, that the trial judge found that
    there was no evidence whatsoever that the firm’s <span class=GramE>points</span> allocations for the appellant in the years in question were undertaken or made
    in bad faith.</span></p>
  <h3><i>3. <span class=GramE>Was</span> the appellant aware
    in any event that his remuneration would be significantly reduced in 2002?</i><i></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The changes in the method of allocation of partnership units
    among partners were well-publicized and well-known to the appellant well in
    advance of the actual allocation made for 2002.  The trial judge found that on a plain reading
    of the documents relating to the new compensation system, it would have been
    apparent, given the nature of the appellant’s practice and his contribution to
    the firm, that his income would be substantially reduced under the new system.  Moreover, there was evidence of statements
    made by the appellant to other partners in 2001 that was capable of supporting
    the trial judge’s inference that the appellant likely new that his level of
    remuneration would be significantly reduced in 2002. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, we are satisfied that there was a basis in the
    evidence for the trial judge to conclude that the appellant was aware that his partnership
    compensation would likely decrease in 2002.  It follows that even if there was a fiduciary
    duty as asserted by the appellant, and even if that fiduciary duty was breached
    by the respondent, it did not cause any loss to the appellant.</span></p>
