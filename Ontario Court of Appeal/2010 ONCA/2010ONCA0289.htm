  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Overview   </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of one count of fraud over
    $5,000.  She was sentenced to fourteen
    months imprisonment, less four months credit for restrictive bail conditions,
    and two years probation.  She was also
    ordered to make restitution in the amount of $35,375.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She appeals her conviction and seeks leave to appeal
    her sentence.  In relation to conviction,
    the appellant’s grounds of appeal concern two pre-trial rulings.  The first is whether the trial judge erred in
    holding that the appellant’s right to trial within a reasonable time pursuant
    to s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms </i>had not been infringed.  The
    second is whether the trial judge erred in admitting hearsay statements for the
    truth of their contents from the two complainants who had both died by the time
    of the trial.  In relation to sentence,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge provided insufficient reasons for
    giving the appellant only four months credit for bail conditions and that the
    sentence is harsh and excessive.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Phillip and Mary Baker <span class=GramE>were</span> an
    elderly retired couple living in Kingston.  Both had significant health issues that required them to hire a
    full-time home care provider.  Jane
    Faulkner, a home care provider, was hired by the Bakers to provide these
    services.  For her services, she was paid
    $15.00/hr and was authorized to withdraw cash in an average weekly amount of $200,
    plus an additional $200 per month extra.  This money was to be given to the Bakers for
    their care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bakers paid little attention to their banking and
    financial affairs.  As a result, they
    were unaware that their accounts were being depleted by Ms. Faulkner on a
    regular, ongoing basis.  Between
    September 1, 2004 and July 26, 2005, Ms. Faulkner defrauded the Bakers of $35,075.50.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Faulkner was first arrested on August 5, 2005,
    under <span class=GramE>an information</span> charging her with fraud under
    $5,000 and trafficking in a credit card.  She was released on bail on August 8, 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police investigation continued after her
    arrest.  On February 27, 2006, she was
    charged under <span class=GramE>a new</span> information, with the more serious
    indictable offence of fraud over $5,000.  The offences charged in the earlier information were both subsumed in
    the single offence charged in the new information. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Section 11(b) Application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence brought an application for an order staying
    the proceedings under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    by reason of an infringement or breach of Ms. Faulkner’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter </i>right to be tried within a
    reasonable time.  The application was
    heard from March 3 to March 6, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, counsel disagreed as to the date of
    commencement of the time period to be examined for delay.  Defence counsel said the period should start
    with the date of the initial arrest of Ms. Faulkner, on August 5, 2005.  Crown counsel said that the period should
    start with the date of the new information sworn on February 27, 2006. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge decided that the time period to be
    examined for delay should start on August 5, 2005 and end on April 25, 2008; a total
    period of about 32 months, 19½ months in the Ontario Court of Justice and 12½
    months in the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge examined the length of the delay, the
    reasons for the delay and prejudice to the accused.  He found that taking all the relevant
    circumstances into account in the case, he was satisfied that the
    constitutional right of Ms. Faulkner to be tried within a reasonable time had
    not been infringed and he dismissed her application accordingly. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Admissibility of Hearsay Evidence Application </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Phillip Baker died on July 30, 2005 and Mary Baker died
    on December 7, 2005.  The Crown’s
    pre-trial application sought an order to admit, for the truth of their
    contents, certain oral or written statements they had made to the investigating
    police officers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 10, 2005, Phillip Baker was interviewed by
    Constable Anderson at the Baker residence.  Constable Anderson had been dispatched because Mr. Baker was concerned
    about a telephone call he had received from his bank that morning, informing
    him that purchases had been made which he had not authorized.  Mr. Baker had asked Ms. Faulkner about the
    purchases earlier in the day and she had denied any knowledge of the purchases,
    but said she was unable to find the VISA card which she said she had last used
    five days previously.  Ms. Faulkner was
    at the Baker residence during the interview, and although she was not
    continually present, she moved back and forth between the room where it took
    place and the kitchen.  The interview
    lasted 30-40 minutes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 13, 2005, Phillip Baker made two statements to
    Constable Douglas.  First, he signed a
    short written statement in the handwriting of Constable Douglas.  Second, he made an oral statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 26, 2005, Mary Baker gave a video statement
    to Constable Douglas. The statement was made under oath and she was
    cautioned.  She signed the standard
    acknowledgment form in respect of these requirements.  The trial judge observed that while giving
    the video statement, Mary Baker presented herself as she was physically, a
    rather frail and elderly person.  He
    noted that her manner was clam and sincere, that she was responsive to the
    questions asked and that her answers were clear and forthright.  He also noted that there was no evidence that
    she had any motive to lie.  Mary Baker’s
    son, Matthew, attended the videotaped interview of his mother as a support
    person.  Matthew was neither sworn nor
    cautioned.  He was the source of many
    interjections during the interview. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of their admissibility at trial, the
    statements were hearsay statements, made out-of-court to a police officer in
    the normal course of a police investigation, by persons who were not available
    to testify at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the admissibility of the
    statements and found that the statements met the test of relevance and the
    requirements of necessity and reliability.  He held that the probative value of the statements was not outweighed by
    their prejudicial effect and ordered that the statements were admissible for
    the truth of their contents at trial. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Trial and sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge announced his decision on the pre-trial
    applications on March 31, 2008. On April 14, 2008, Ms. Faulkner pleaded not
    guilty.  The Crown read into the record a
    synopsis of the admissible evidence tendered by the Crown, with the consent of
    the defence.  Ms. Faulkner did not
    testify and was found guilty as charged.  She was sentenced on June 12, 2008.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues on Appeal</span></h4>
  <h3>1)        Did the trial judge err in finding that Ms. Faulkner’s rights
    under s. 11 (b) of <i>Charter </i>were not
    infringed?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the thirty-three month delay
    is <i>prima facie </i>very excessive and
    infringes Ms. Faulkner’s s. 11(b) rights absent extremely exceptional
    circumstances explaining the delay which he submits do not exist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, the trial judge did not err in
    concluding that the appellant’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> rights were not infringed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that approximately 13 months of
    delay were as a direct result of Crown conduct, in particular, untimely disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    trial judge held that the banking records, which were the object of the delayed
    disclosure, were not in the possession of the Crown or the police.  The appellant has not been able to show us
    that the trial judge erred in this regard.  The defence did not bring an application for third party
    disclosure.  Instead the defence asked
    the Crown for these records.  Now the
    defence seeks to attribute the delay involved in obtaining these records to
    delay on the part of the Crown.  In our
    opinion, the appellant’s allegation of Crown disclosure delays is not borne
    out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that additional delay was due to
    the complicating factors unique to the case.  The complainant was an Ontario Court of Justice judge who had been retired
    for five years.  The appellant asked that
    an out of region judge, who did not have personal knowledge of the complainant,
    be brought in to conduct the preliminary inquiry and trial.  The appellant says that the trial judge was
    wrong to cite the proposed defence, that Ms. Faulkner had been authorized to
    use the credit cards in return for sexual favours, as a complicating factor
    requiring extra time in the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge correctly recognized that these were
    complicating factors requiring extra time.  The trial judge mentioned the proposed defence as an additional reason
    supporting the appellant’s request. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to the appellant’s submissions
    nor to the other arguments made in the appellant’s factum but not argued with
    respect to s. 11(b).  This ground of
    appeal is dismissed. </p>
  <h3>2)        Did the trial judge err in admitting for the truth of their
    contents the three statements made by Phillip Baker and the videotaped
    statement of Mary Baker? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the necessity requirement
    was not met with respect to Mary Baker’s videotaped statement and that the
    police should have taken more care to “preserve” her evidence, specifically by
    having arranged for defence counsel to be present during the statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admissibility of Mary Baker’s videotaped statement
    was reasonably necessary.  In submissions
    before us the appellant acknowledged that her statement covered a much broader
    time frame than Phillip Baker’s.  Although
    Mary Baker’s health at the time was frail, her passing was unexpected.  The police were under no obligation to invite
    defence counsel to attend or to participate in the interview. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that it is dangerous to rely on
    Phillip Baker’s statements: none of them were video recorded, only one of the
    three was signed by him and even the signed statement was not in his
    handwriting.  The appellant also points
    out that all of Phillip Baker’s statements were taken before Ms. Faulkner was
    first arrested.  In addition, the
    appellant challenges the reliability of Mary Baker’s videotaped statement based
    primarily on the presence of her son, Matthew Baker, in the interview room and
    raises a concern about how much influence Matthew exercised over Mary Baker. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, the trial judge did not err in
    admitting the statements.  The defence
    could have cross-examined Matthew Baker concerning his presence in the
    interview room but chose not to do so.  The reliability of the oral and written statements of Philip Baker and
    the video statement of Mary Baker is supported by other documents admitted in
    evidence and detailed by the trial judge at para. 81 of his reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground of appeal and
    accordingly the appeal as to conviction is dismissed. </p>
  <h3>3)        Did the trial judge err in giving the appellant credit for
    four of the 35 months spent under house arrest? Was the overall sentence
    excessive?   </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amount of credit was within the discretion of the
    trial judge and we see no error in principle on his part.  In any event, having regard to the aggravating
    factors including the vulnerability of the victims, the significant breach of
    trust, and the duration of the fraud,  the overall sentence is fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
    appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</span></p>
