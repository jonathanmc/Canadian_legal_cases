  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is
    a Crown appeal from sentence.  The
    respondent plead guilty to administering the chemical, Kathlon, to the victim
    with intent to cause bodily harm to her contrary to s. 245(a) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and to criminal harassment
    under s. 264(2)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The primary
    issue is whether the respondent’s conduct constituted a “serious personal
    injury offence”, (SPIO) pursuant to s. 752 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> such that a conditional sentence was
    unavailable.  Alternatively, the Crown
    submits that the sentence is demonstrably unfit. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1999, the respondent began having an extra-marital
    affair with his co-worker, the victim, which lasted almost five years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the relationship had ended, in June 2004, the victim
    began to suffer from burns on the bottom of her feet.  This was diagnosed as contact
    dermatitis.  In December 2004, the victim
    left work for a year of maternity leave and the problem subsided during that
    period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the victim returned to work in January 2005, the
    problem with the burns and blisters on her feet returned almost immediately and
    became almost debilitating.  The
    situation got worse.  The blisters
    started to appear on her back and thighs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim went on another maternity leave in September
    2006, and during this time she had no problems.  However, when she returned to work in September 2007, the blisters on
    her feet reappeared and also on her arms and abdomen.  The situation became so severe that she had
    difficulty walking. She was off work for six weeks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually the victim and others became suspicious that
    she was somehow being targeted.  The victim
    had been reporting to her employer that her desk had been “messed with”, memos
    had gone missing from her desk, papers were moved, her computer was damaged and
    notes were left on her desk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, several anonymous calls and letters sent to
    the Children’s Aid Society alleged that the victim had neglected and abused her
    children.  These allegations were found
    to be unfounded.  Two anonymous notes
    were sent to the victim’s employer, alleging that she was faking her illness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim began to notice and report finding liquid on
    her desk and work area in the mornings when she arrived at work. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late August 2008, a private investigator was
    hired.  He installed hidden surveillance
    cameras monitoring the victim’s work station.  The surveillance disclosed that the respondent was tampering with items
    in the victim’s work area in the early morning hours and going through her
    files, drawers and accessing locked drawers.  He was observed spraying a substance on the arm rests of her chair,
    mouse and keyboard of her computer.  He
    left love letters in the drawer of her desk, began showing up in her office and
    sending messages to her at work and he was turning up wherever she was in the
    plant.  He began calling her at
    home.  He was also sending her numerous
    emails and professing his love for her and expressing anger at her for ending
    their relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The investigation disclosed that the respondent had
    been spraying Aciticide SPX Kathlon on the victim’s desk and other areas which
    was the cause of all the burns and blistering which she had been experiencing
    on and off over the four year period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kathlon is a chemical which causes severe itching,
    burning and blistering on contact with human skin.  The chemical is cumulative in its
    effects.  The more contact there is with
    the chemical, the worse the effects get and the more serious the injury
    becomes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent plead guilty to administering the
    chemical, Kathlon, to the victim with intent to cause bodily harm to her
    contrary to s. 245(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>and to criminal harassment under s. 264(2)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stead J. of the Ontario Court of Justice sentenced the
    respondent to an 18 month conditional sentence, starting with six month of
    house arrest, and to two years probation. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues on Appeal</span></h4>
  <h3>1)        Did the respondent’s conduct constitute a “serious personal
    injury offence” pursuant to s. 752 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> such that a conditional sentence was unavailable?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his Reasons for Sentence, Stead J. found that the
    respondent’s conduct did not constitute a SPIO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in
    law.  It submits that the offence,
    specifically administering a destructive thing with intent thereby to cause
    bodily harm under s. 245(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> is, by its very nature, a SPIO because the accused necessarily
    endangers the safety of another person in administering the substance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although that may well be the case, it is clear that
    the respondent’s particular conduct in the circumstances of this <span
class=GramE>case,</span> constitutes an SPIO because he plainly endangered the
    victim’s safety on any definition of endangerment and harm.  He intentionally exposed her to a corrosive
    chemical that caused her serious bodily injury.  Accordingly a conditional sentence was unavailable for this offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum, the respondent submitted that the SPIO
    considerations were irrelevant given the timeframe of the indictment.  This submission was made on the basis that
    the amendment to s. 742.1 that eliminated the availability of conditional
    sentences for SPIO’s was not proclaimed in force until July 2, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The start date of the indictment was July 1, 2008 for
    the destructive thing charge and April 1, 2008 for the criminal harassment
    charge.  Tremear’s <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> and
    Crankshaw’s legislative history indicate that the section was proclaimed in
    force on November 30, 2007 and, therefore, a conditional sentence was not
    available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also submits that the court ought not to
    take into consideration anything outside the time frame of the indictment.   As part of this submission, counsel for the
    respondent argues that the Crown did not prove that the respondent repeatedly
    sprayed the victim’s work station.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court is entitled to have regard to aggravating
    factors outside the time of the indictment read in as part of the facts to
    which the respondent plead guilty.  The
    facts read in indicate that in 2004 the victim began to suffer a reaction to a
    destructive thing.  The inference from the
    facts read in is that, on at least one occasion, at some time prior to the time
    frame alleged in the indictment, the respondent put some of that chemical on
    the victim’s work place station and work clothes.  By his pleas the respondent acknowledged he
    was the one who was spraying the destructive thing.  He again sprayed the chemical during the time
    frame of the indictment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the submission that the respondent was
    not aware of the harm he was causing, we note that in order to handle this
    substance, special equipment, gloves, were required and used by the respondent.  That would send a message to even the most
    obtuse that the substance was capable of causing serious bodily harm.  The evidence is clear that in the spring of
    2008 there was a workplace meeting about the victim’s difficulties at work that
    he attended.  The facts read in also
    indicate that after she returned to work after a vacation in July 2008 the
    victim began to have skin rashes to her face, arms, legs and stomach.  Rashes, blisters and burns developed in these
    areas.  The respondent was clearly aware
    or wilfully blind to the harm he was causing yet, despite this, the respondent
    sprayed the victim’s workplace station again.</p>
  <h3>2)       Regardless of the SPIO holding, was the 18 month conditional
    sentence disproportionate to the gravity of the offences and the degree of
    responsibility of the offender, making it demonstrably unfit in all the
    circumstances? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s position at trial was that an appropriate
    sentence was three to four years actual imprisonment.  The Crown submits that the conditional
    sentence imposed by Stead J. reflects errors in principle and was demonstrably
    unfit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with this submission.  The trial judge minimized the extent of the
    victim’s injuries.  Having regard to the
    intimate relationship between the victim and the respondent, the respondent
    committed a significant breach of trust.  He engaged in controlling and manipulative <span class=GramE>behaviour,</span> knew of harm caused or was wilfully blind to it yet continued to engage in this
    conduct.  His conduct shows extensive
    planning and deliberation.  The
    respondent engaged in the conduct he did for a selfish motive.  He wanted the victim to quit her job so he
    would no longer see her.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal as to sentence must be allowed.  The offence deserves a penitentiary
    sentence.  Giving the respondent credit
    of six months for the time he has served under house arrest on his conditional
    sentence, and, bearing in mind that he is a first offender, we are of the
    opinion that in the circumstances a sentence of two years less a day is a fit
    sentence.  We would maintain the two year
    probationary period on the terms imposed by the trial judge.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
    Crown’s appeal as to sentence is allowed and the sentence is varied to a period
    of imprisonment of two years less a day.  All other terms and conditions of the sentence
    imposed by the trial judge remain.  </p>
