  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 14, 1999, the appellant D.V.B. appeared
    before Whetung J. of the Ontario Court of Justice and entered pleas of guilty
    to one count of sexual assault and one count of breach of probation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead of proceeding with a conventional sentence
    hearing, the Crown applied under s. 753 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender,
    using the offence of sexual assault as the predicate offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 19, 1999, following a full hearing designed to
    determine whether the appellant fit the dangerous offender criteria and if so,
    what sentence he should receive, Whetung J. found the appellant to be a
    dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate period of detention in
    a penitentiary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from that decision. The appeal
    comes to us more than 10 years after the impugned designation was made. In the
    interim, as the fresh evidence filed on appeal reveals, the appellant has not
    received any meaningful treatment while in prison, and apart from his
    chronological age, he remains by and large the same person he was when he
    entered the penitentiary system over a decade ago. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, the appellant submits that he should
    not have been declared a dangerous offender and he seeks to be re-designated as
    a long-term offender.  In his factum, which
    was filed in 2005, the appellant requested that he be sentenced as a long-term
    offender to “time served” plus a ten-year supervision order. In oral argument,
    counsel altered that position and now requests that the appellant be sentenced
    to an additional year in custody as a precursor to a ten-year supervision
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his submission that the sentencing judge
    erred in declaring him to be a dangerous offender instead of a long-term
    offender, the appellant relies on the following three grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge erred in holding that the requirements of s. 753.1(1)(c) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> would only be met
    if he were satisfied that it was reasonably possible to control the risk posed
    by the appellant within the duration of a long-term offender sentence, such
    that upon its completion, the appellant would pose an acceptable level of risk
    in the community;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>In
    imposing an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, the sentencing judge failed
    to give adequate weight to the principle of proportionality; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    dangerous offender finding should be set aside as unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, I would not give effect to any
    of these grounds and would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    or not the person or persons in respect of whom it is feared that the offence

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sexual assault occurred on June 2, 1992. It
    involved a six-year old child. The child and her parents were visiting a family
    with whom the appellant was living at the time. The incident occurred when the
    appellant took the child for a walk in the woods. At some point during the
    walk, the appellant picked the child up to protect her from bugs. It was then
    that he placed his hand down her shorts and touched her vagina over her
    underwear. After putting the child down, the appellant warned her not to tell
    anybody or he would hurt her. The appellant was on probation at the time for a
    property offence he committed in 1991.</p>

    historic counts of indecent assault. The charges dated back to the 1970’s when
    the appellant was between the ages of 12 and 18. The offences consisted of
    fondling the genitals of two of his siblings – twin brothers, 7 years his
    junior. The appellant received a suspended sentence and 3 years probation for
    these offences.  Under the terms of the
    probation order, the appellant was prohibited from being in the presence of
    anyone under the age of 16 unless accompanied by someone age 21 or older – a
    condition that he clearly breached when he lured K.C.-Y. into his bedroom on

    purposes of the dangerous offender proceeding, the appellant was assessed by
    two forensic experts – Dr. Gojer, a psychiatrist chosen by the Crown, and Dr.
    Eccles, a psychologist chosen by the defence. Both doctors prepared reports
    that were filed as exhibits on the dangerous offender application and each
    testified at the sentence hearing. Their findings and conclusions as to the
    appellant’s mental status and the various factors that render him a danger to
    children are similar and non-contentious. </span></p>

    p. 7 of his report dated March 18, 1999, Dr. Gojer diagnosed the appellant as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    diagnosed Mr. B. as suffering from heterosexual and homosexual paedophilia.
    Sexual sadism is a possibility too. He also has a serious problem with alcohol
    abuse. He also suffers from mental retardation of the mild variety.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the same report, again at p. 7, Dr. Gojer assessed the appellant’s degree of
    dangerousness and the risk he posed for reoffending against children:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There
    is nothing in the history to suggest that Mr. B. has a personality disorder of
    an antisocial nature or that he suffers from psychopathy. On the other hand he
    does have a paedophilia, which is a relatively persistent illness which cannot
    be cured. His paedophilia places him at a risk of acting out on his sexual
    impulses and certainly places all children at risk from him. The ability that
    Mr. B. has in curtailing his sexual impulses is limited by his mental
    retardation. The use of alcohol can cause further disinhibition with a greater
    degree of impulsivity and acting out on underlying paedophiliac urges.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    is possible that Mr. B.’s alcoholism can be treated with very close supervision
    in the community. On account of limited insight into his drinking behavior and
    his mental retardation the prognosis for abstinence is guarded.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>His
    sex offending behavior can be treated by using pharmacotherapy and cognitive
    behavior psychotherapy. The effectiveness that cognitive behavioural psychotherapy
    will have will be limited on account of his mental retardation and the backbone
    of any treatment for his sexual offending behavior should be pharmacotherapy.
    The use of antiandrogen drugs can bring about a significant reduction in the
    risk of him reoffending in a violent sexual manner in the future. Mr. B. is
    agreeable to taking medication to bring about a reduction in his sex drive by
    the use of oral or injectable antiandrogen drugs. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    note that Dr. Eccles evaluated Mr. B. in November 1998 as being at a moderate
    to high risk to reoffend based on actuarial factors and that he is at moderate
    risk to reoffend on the basis of clinical factors. He estimated the overall
    risk of reoffending as moderately high. I do not dispute these findings. It is
    my opinion that Mr. B. without treatment is a moderately high risk to reoffend
    with a sexual offense against a child.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    a report dated November 19, 1998, Dr. Eccles evaluated the appellant’s risk for
    reoffending following the August 1998 incident with K.C.-Y. Taking into account
    the nature and history of the appellant’s offences against children, his
    arousal patterns, his intelligence and social competence and various actuarial
    and clinical factors, Dr.&nbsp;Eccles concluded that the appellant posed a
    moderate to high risk of committing “either another sexual offense or a
    non-sexual violent offense.”  In support
    of his conclusion, at p. 7 of his report, Dr. Eccles highlighted the following
    concerns about the appellant:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    B. is a sexual recidivist with relatively little insight into his behavior. He
    has reoffended while on supervision, and his victims have been relatively
    young. He has a sexual interest in children and no access to appropriately aged
    partners. Furthermore, he is deficient in the social skills that are helpful in
    acquiring such partners. His intellectual limitations, as well as his inability
    to read or write, will severely limit what he can achieve from any treatment he
    receives. Furthermore, his apparent addiction to alcohol is a significant risk
    factor, and provides additional complications for his treatment and risk
    management.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the criteria needed to have the appellant declared a dangerous
    offender, Dr. Gojer expressed the following opinion at p. 8 of his March 18,
    1999 report:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    B. has a sexual deviation, paedophilia which is a life long condition. He has
    clearly shown that he has been unable to control his impulses even while on
    probation and his current index offense is the digital penetration of a very young
    girl with him causing injury to her vagina. He has mild mental retardation and
    a history of alcohol abuse. Both conditions increase the risk of impulsive
    behavior and of acting out sexually in the future. These features, in my
    opinion, satisfy the criteria for a Dangerous Offender.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
    Gojer and Dr. Eccles noticed two other disturbing features about the appellant
    that raised concerns about his treatability. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    both doctors were troubled by the appellant’s tendency to downgrade his
    interest in children and to deny any misconduct towards them. At times, the
    appellant would take the position that his criminal convictions were
    unwarranted and that he had never sexually assaulted anyone. At other times, he
    would admit to his wrongdoings but attribute his misbehavior to the disinhibiting
    effects of alcohol. In an interview with Dr.&nbsp;Gojer, the appellant reportedly
    said that “it was his drinking that was responsible for the sexual assault” on
    K.C.-Y. and that “his problem with young girls is only when he drinks.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second disturbing feature noted by Dr. Gojer and Dr. Eccles was the appellant’s
    ambivalence towards obtaining treatment. Despite assurances from the appellant
    that he was motivated to obtain help, both doctors remained skeptical, particularly
    in light of the appellant’s tendency to deny his paedophilia and his prior
    wrongdoings. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
    Gojer and Dr. Eccles testified that in the appellant’s case, given his
    cognitive limitations, treatment could only be effected, if at all, through pharmacotherapy.
    To succeed, the appellant would have to commit to a life-long program in which
    he would be required to take anti-androgen medication once a month to curb his
    sexual urges and antibuse medication daily to prevent him from drinking.
    Slippage in either case, even for a brief period of time, would put children
    who might come into contact with the appellant at serious risk. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    likelihood of the appellant taking his medication as required was highly
    questionable. If there was any hope at all, the appellant would have to remain
    motivated to obtain treatment for his entire life – and for this to occur, he
    would have to accept the fact that he is a pedophile and that he poses a
    serious threat to children without treatment. In this respect, denial presented
    a serious obstacle – why take medication for a problem that does not exist?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
    Gojer and Dr. Eccles were asked to consider whether the appellant would be an
    appropriate candidate for a long-term offender sentence. Under that regime, he
    would be incarcerated for two or more years, following which he would be
    released into the community under the strictures of a supervision order for a
    period of up to ten years. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
    Gojer and Dr. Eccles were very guarded in their responses. The appellant
    suffered from paedophilia – a life-long condition that could be controlled but
    not cured. He would require treatment for the rest of his life and in his case,
    given his cognitive limitations, pharmacotherapy was the treatment of choice –
    indeed, it was the only realistic means of controlling his sexual urges towards
    children and preventing him from acting on them. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ensuring
    life-long compliance with his treatment program was critical – and in the
    appellant’s case, this meant intensive supervision and close monitoring –
    something  both doctors felt could be achieved
    under the strict controls of a ten-year supervision order.  But once the supervision order terminated, it
    was impossible to predict how the appellant would fare. There would be no
    controls in place and it would be up to the appellant to decide, on a voluntary
    basis, whether he wished to continue with treatment. And if he chose not to
    continue his treatment, he would revert back to his present risk of reoffending
    and would pose a serious threat to the safety of children. Dr. Gojer explained
    the conundrum as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        Okay, what about you said you use the
    phrase “low probability”, what about after the 10 year [supervision order] period?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        That’s what I said, after the 10 years
    my understanding is that if he continues to take his medication, then it’s very
    clear that his risk to the community will be low. If he chooses to stop taking
    his medication, the risk that he will have will start rising. This can be
    offset to a certain degree by any individual counselling or psychological
    therapies he has. Essentially Mr. B. needs therapy for the rest of his life and
    whether he will take therapy for the rest of his life or not I said is a
    debatable point, but the mere fact that in the past when he was on probation he
    refused to attend for therapy. <i>Whether at
    the end of 10 years with all of the therapy he’s had, he will continue taking
    therapy, it is a debatable point, I would say that the probability would be
    less rather than more</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        Okay, and I know it’s a difficult
    question, but as a reasonable man, are you able to assess, is it a reasonable
    possibility that there will be eventual control?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        The reasonable possibility I would limit
    to a 10 year period. There’s a reasonable possibility of controlling this man’s
    behavior over a 10 year period.</span></p>

    that Mr. B. constitutes a threat to the life, safety, or physical well-being or
    mental well-being of other persons by virtue of his pattern of repetitive
    behaviour, a part of which includes the present offence and which shows a
    failure to restrain his conduct which results in a likelihood of the prescribed

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition, pursuant to section 753(b), the subject offence involves a serious

    impulses, thereby creating a likelihood of the prescribed harm.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having
    found that the appellant met the requisite criteria to be declared a dangerous
    offender, the trial judge recognized that he “need not necessarily find [the
    appellant] to be a dangerous offender.” Other choices remained open to him,
    including the possibility that the appellant could be declared a long-term
    offender under s. 753.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. In that regard, s. 753.1(1)(a) posed no problem.  Imposing a sentence of two or more years on
    the appellant for the predicate offence of sexual assault against K.C.-Y. was
    clearly appropriate. Likewise, s.&nbsp;753.1(1)(b) presented no impediment. On
    any view of the evidence, the appellant represented a substantial risk of
    reoffending. Hence, the matter came down to s. 753.1(1)(c) – was there “a
    reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community”?</span></p>

    indicated, the evidence on this issue was mixed. Dr. Gojer and Dr. Eccles
    expressed guarded optimism that the risk posed by the appellant could be
    reduced to an acceptable level during the currency of a ten-year supervision
    order. Thereafter, they were pessimistic. Neither doctor was prepared to say
    that there was a reasonable possibility that the risk posed by the appellant
    would remain at an acceptable level following the conclusion of the long-term
    sentence. In this regard, Dr. Gojer considered it more likely than not that the
    appellant would discontinue therapy once the ten-year supervision order ended.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    light of that evidence, the debate between Crown and defence counsel </span>centred<span
lang=EN-US> on the wording of s. 753.1(1)(c)
    and in particular, whether the provision would only be satisfied if it were
    reasonably possible that the risk posed by the appellant would be controlled
    within the duration of the long-term offender sentence, such that upon its
    completion, the appellant would pose an acceptable level of risk in the
    community; or, would the provision be satisfied if it were reasonably possible
    to control the risk posed by the appellant during the currency of the long-term
    sentence, even though the same could not be said following its completion. The
    sentencing judge responded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Having
    heard both counsel at length on this point, I accept the Crown position that s.
    753.1(1)(c) implicitly requires that there be a reasonable possibility of

    reasonable possibility of control of the risk in the community for the period

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    sentencing judge then turned to the evidence given by Dr. Gojer and Dr.&nbsp;Eccles
    and explained why, in his view, he was not satisfied that it was reasonably possible
    that the risk posed by the appellant would be controlled within the duration of
    a long-term sentence. In this regard, he noted that after the expiry of the
    ten-year supervision order, the appellant’s risk of reoffending would revert to

    and four convictions for sexual assault. Two of the sexual assaults involved
    the same woman. The first of these incidents occurred in 1987 when Goodwin and

    a dissenting opinion, Ryan J.A. concluded that the trial judge did not err in refusing

    as a long-term offender because he did not meet the requirements of s.
    753.1(1)(c). Ryan&nbsp;J.A.’s reasons in this regard are succinct and bear
    repetition in full. They are found at paras. 52 and 53 of her decision:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view the sentencing judge did not err. In order to qualify as a long-term
    offender the court must be satisfied under s. 753.1(1)(c) that “there is a
    reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.” A
    long-term offender sentence is composed of imprisonment for a two-year minimum
    followed by a supervision order not to exceed 10 years. <i>In my view, the wording of s. 753.1(1)(c) means that there must be a
    reasonable possibility that the risk will be controlled within the duration of
    the long-term offender sentence. The evidence in this case is that the offender
    will not be controlled within the duration of the sentence. </i>He will be a
    risk throughout his lifetime. His condition is intractable. As a result, he
    does not meet the long-term offender criteria.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>My colleague’s reasons for judgment
    recognize that the risk that Mr. Goodwin poses will not likely be controlled
    within the duration of a long-term offender sentence. He accepts the

    through the provisions of s. 810.2 of the Code. I do not agree that those

    to the view expressed by Donald J.A., I do not take from the fact that s.&nbsp;810.2
    came into force at the same time as the long-term offender provisions that
    Parliament, presumably with a view to creating a harmonious scheme, intended to
    off-load on to s. 810.2 the important task of protecting the community from
    people who are highly dangerous and who have been unable to satisfy the
    relatively modest requirements of s. 753.1(1)(c).  In my view, s. 810.2 does not contain the
    clout needed to shoulder that burden, nor does it provide for the machinery
    needed to process the never-ending stream of annual hearings that would result.
    In the context of the long-term offender regime, I prefer instead to view s.
    810.2 as a safety valve that Parliament put into place to address those cases

    respect, the construction of s. s. 753.1(1)(c) that I favour does not lead to
    the unfair treatment of offenders; nor does it give rise to unjust sentences.
    Under the long-term offender regime, Parliament has built in a very substantial
    period of time for offenders to obtain the treatment they need to reduce their
    risk in the community to an acceptable level. Long-term offenders must be
    incarcerated for at least two years on the predicate offence and thereafter,
    they can be subjected to a supervision order for up to ten years. For most
    people who are treatable, I would have thought that 12 years (and possibly much
    longer depending on the period of incarceration for the predicate offence) is a
    generous timeframe within which to achieve the relatively modest progress
    contemplated by s.&nbsp;753.1(1)(c). In this regard, it must be remembered that
    under s.&nbsp;753.1(1)(c), a judge need not be satisfied that the risk posed by
    the offender <i>will </i>be controlled
    within the 12-year (or longer) timeframe;  all that is required is that there be <i>a reasonable possibility</i> that such
    control can be achieved. </span></p>

    requirements of s. 753.1(1)(c) in the generous timeframe allotted by Parliament,
    then in my view, they should be declared dangerous offenders and given an indeterminate
    sentence. As my colleague Cronk J.A. explained in <i>R. v. Little</i> (2007), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 20, at para. 70 (leave to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    court is required on a dangerous offender application to balance the liberty

    release of the  accused into the

    in a contest between an individual offender’s interest in invoking the
    long-term offender provisions of the <i>Code</i> and the protection of the public, the latter must prevail.</span></p>

    If he is correct, I fail to see how any person who suffers from a condition
    that is potentially controllable with life-long supervision, 24 hours a day, 7
    days a week, could ever be declared a dangerous offender and given an indeterminate
    sentence. On Donald&nbsp;J.A.’s model, it would be up to the court to ensure
    that the necessary supervisory arrangements were in place, and there is no
    telling the amount of resources that would be needed to fund such a regime. In
    this regard, I refer again to my colleague Cronk J.A. at para. 70 of <i>Little</i>,<i> </i>where she observed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As

    effectively been incorporated into the long-term offender provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. As Iacobucci and Arbour JJ.

    sufficient to reduce this threat [of harm] to an acceptable level, despite the
    fact that the statutory criteria in s. 753(1) [the dangerous offender criteria]

    analysis dictated by s. 753.1(1)(c) – whether there is a reasonable possibility
    of eventual control of the risk posed by the offender in the community. If that

    meet the long-term offender criteria, the sentencing judge went on – in the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There
    are factors that play in his persona which seem to be beyond his control. He is

    mindful of these features, the sentencing judge was alive to other features of
    the case that weighed against exercising his discretion in favour of declaring the
    appellant to be a long-term offender.  In
    this regard, the sentencing judge considered the appellant’s prospects for
    treatment and noted that without medication “there would be no substantial
    change possible”.  The sentencing judge
    also took into account the nature and seriousness of the predicate offence and
    the appellant’s degree of moral turpitude. The offence involved “the sexual
    touching and physical injury of a four-year old child.” The appellant knew that
    “this was wrong” and he also “knew that he was physically hurting the child
    because she was crying… but he was able to ignore it and continue with the
    act.” In the sentencing judge’s opinion, the appellant’s crime was “extremely
    serious” and his “moral turpitude” was a matter of “grave concern.” </span></p>

    considered the appellant’s treatability, the nature and seriousness of the

    explained why in the end, he felt it necessary to declare the appellant a
    dangerous offender:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless,
    in finding Mr. B. to be a dangerous offender I am not doing so because he is
    developmentally delayed, or because he is a pedophile, or because he is an
    alcoholic. Rather, I am finding him to be a dangerous offender because these
    conditions, taken collectively and together with the present offence, and the
    history represented by his past offences, together with the prognosis and
    treatment prospects testified to by the doctors and their opinions in that
    regard make him a dangerous offender as contemplated by parliament in section
    753 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There
    is no conventional sentence which I can impose in this matter which would
    adequately protect the public from Mr. B. and the sort of acts he has committed

    offender is not a matter to be taken lightly, and in my opinion it is the
    required disposition here.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Parliament
    has seen fit to define the term “serious personal injury offence” as including
    the offence of sexual assault. In doing so, Parliament chose not to draw a
    distinction between forced intercourse at knife point and “mere” fondling or
    touching. Every sexual assault is to be treated as serious and doubly so, in my
    view, where the victims are helpless children.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    the extent that the appellant bases his “disproportionality” argument on the
    nature and seriousness of his crimes, a similar argument was considered and rejected
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v.
    Currie</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260. At para. 24 of that decision, Lamer C.J.C.
    made the following apposite comments:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>By
    definition, therefore, arguments of proportionality do not withstand scrutiny. There
    may be, as the respondent asserts, an objective difference between the
    nighttime rape at knife point and the predicate offences [repeated sexual
    touching of young girls in public], but this distinction is not reflected in
    s.&nbsp;752 or 753 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    Indeed the respondent is asking the Court to alter or even reduce the
    definition of “serious personal injury offence”. The alteration would, as the
    appellant notes, effectively guarantee that an accused who has committed an
    arguably less serious sexual predicate offence would never be declared a
    dangerous offender. I cannot imagine that Parliament wanted the courts to wait
    for an obviously dangerous individual, regardless of the nature of his criminal
    record and notwithstanding the force of expert opinion as to his potential
    dangerousness, to commit a particularly violent and grievous offence before he
    or she can be declared a dangerous offender.</span></p>

    for the appellant’s degree of moral blameworthiness, I do not see the
    characteristics that make the appellant “less blameworthy” as having much impact
    on the dangerous offender application. The focus of such an application is on
    future dangerousness and the protection of society. The appellant is a pedophile.
    While that is unfortunate, the reality remains that untreated, he presents a
    serious threat to the safety of children in our society. And, as my colleague
    Cronk J.A. pointed out in <i>Little</i> at
    para. 70: “…in a contest between an individual’s interest in invoking the

    Treatment Centre in Kingston. Indeed, Correctional Service Reports dating back

    Sandbach reports that the appellant has not yet been enrolled in the High
    Intensity Sex Offender Treatment Program because the program is offered
    infrequently – “once a year if we’re lucky” – and offenders with fixed release
    dates are therefore given priority over offenders like the appellant who are

    will be given the opportunity to participate in it. That information is helpful

    that in mind, I return to Dr. Gojer’s reassessment. Stripped to its essentials,
    as I read Dr. Gojer’s updated report and his cross-examination, it would appear
    that very little if anything has changed other than the appellant’s
    chronological age. The appellant continues to be in a state of denial. He has
    now conjured up an innocent explanation for the predicate offence involving </span>K.C.-Y.
    He claims that his twin brothers “made up a story” about him because they “were
    angry … when he refused to let them drive a tractor”.  He denies having placed his hands down the
    pants of a six-year old child while giving her a piggy-back ride. And perhaps
    most significantly, he claims that he has “never had any sexual interest in
    children”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the same time, Dr. Gojer reports that the
    appellant “admits to having pedophilic interests” and “seems to appreciate the wrongfulness
    of his actions, the possible harmful effects for a victim, and he expresses
    regret for his past behaviour”. Dr.&nbsp;Gojer also reports that the
    appellant’s “express commitment to treatment, including pharmacological
    approaches, is encouraging”. Against this, however, he acknowledged to
    Ms.&nbsp;Hallett in cross-examination that the appellant’s tendency to deny his
    wrongdoings and to downplay his sexual interest in children constitutes “an
    aggravating risk factor” in terms of his treatability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, Dr. Gojer confirms his original
    opinion that the appellant poses a moderate to high risk of reoffending against
    children. He further reiterates that in his view, the appellant could “be
    managed in the community on a Long-Term Offender Designation”.  His up-dated report concludes as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[The
    appellant] is now 47 years old and will be about 57 years of age when a 10-year
    supervision ends. While his risk will not be eliminated, age alone will see a
    reduction in likelihood of offending. Ongoing management can be continued on an
    810 order.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect, I find Dr. Gojer’s reassessment to be unhelpful. In the end, apart
    from stating the obvious – that at the completion of a ten-year supervision
    order, the appellant will now be close to 60 – Dr. Gojer basically states that
    there have been no significant changes in the appellant and certainly none that
    would materially reduce the risk he presents to children. Dr. Pollock comes to
    the same conclusion in his report.</span></p>
