  <h4><span lang=EN-US> OVERVIEW </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the interpretation of a fleet
    insurance contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that the Honda Civic,
    driven by Rachel Noonan, was not covered by the optional insurance that she
    purchased when she rented the car from Choice Car and Truck Rental (Choice).  That insurance was provided by Zurich
    Insurance Company (Zurich) pursuant to a fleet insurance endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal
    and, based on the wording of this particular policy and endorsement, declare that
    the Zurich insurance contract provided coverage for the leased cars in Choice’s
    fleet, the number of which Choice was obliged to include in a monthly report to
    Zurich.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application was brought pursuant to rules 14.05(3)(d)
    and (g) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  It arises from an underlying action that was
    brought against Ms. Noonan and Tracmount/Glojack Leasing (Tracmount).  The plaintiff in that action  alleged that he suffered injuries when he was
    hit by the Honda Civic driven by Ms. Noonan in November 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Zurich denied a duty to defend and indemnify Ms. Noonan
    or Tracmount on the basis that Choice did not have coverage for that particular
    car because Choice did not identify the Honda Civic in its monthly fleet report.  Ms. Noonan responded by issuing a Third Party
    Claim against Zurich and Choice.  She
    alleged that Choice acted as Zurich’s agent in providing the insurance coverage
    and sought an order that Zurich provide her with coverage for the accident, as
    well as relief from forfeiture for any default in Choice’s obligation to
    specify particulars in its monthly reports.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Choice leased the Honda Civic from Tracmount pursuant
    to a written lease dated November 1, 2004.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The form of lease obliged Choice to provide
    insurance.  However, as a precaution
    against a failure on Choice’s part to do so, Tracmount maintained a contingent
    lessor’s liability insurance policy with Lombard Canada Ltd. (Lombard).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Zurich and Lombard have agreed that if the Zurich insurance
    contract does not respond, the Lombard policy will respond to provide coverage
    and to require Lombard to defend and indemnify Ms. Noonan and Tracmount.  Lombard is the applicant and appellant in
    this proceeding.  It takes the position
    that it stands in the shoes of Ms. Noonan in bringing the application for a
    declaration that Zurich is the insurer required to defend and indemnify Ms.
    Noonan in the underlying action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Which insurance contract responds depends on the
    interpretation of the Zurich insurance contract, and in particular, the
    provision regarding the required contents of the monthly reports.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE INSURANCE CONTRACT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1.1 of the standard Ontario Automobile Policy
    (OAP 1) (the Policy), entitled “This Policy is Part of a Contract”, provides
    that the insurance contract includes three documents:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A completed and signed Application for
    Automobile Insurance,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>this policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Application for Automobile Insurance did not form
    part of the record in this case.  In addition,
    the record does not contain a document entitled a “Certificate of Automobile
    Insurance” issued to Choice.  Counsel acknowledged
    that they “do not have” such a document.  There was no indication in the record whether one was issued or, if one was
    issued, as to the nature of its contents.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the only relevant documents for the
    purpose of interpreting the Zurich insurance contract are the Policy and the fleet
    endorsement entitled “OPCF 21A Monthly Reporting Basis Fleet” (the Endorsement).</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(a)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       The Policy<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></b></span></span></a></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Policy document begins with a section-by-section
    explanation entitled “About This Policy”.  It explains that section 2, “What Automobiles are Covered”, specifies
    that “coverages are available” to a “described” automobile and to other types
    of automobiles in certain circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next part of the Policy, entitled “What Insurance
    is Required by Law?”, provides that “[y]ou only have a specific coverage if
    your Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it...” Similarly, the
    section 1.1 “Introduction” provides that the insured only has “a particular
    coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate of Automobile Insurance
    shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is provided at no cost.”  Section 1.3 defines a Certificate of
    Automobile Insurance as “a written document summarizing your insurance
    coverage” that “lists the coverages purchased [and] premiums charged ...” and “shows
    … the described automobile or automobiles.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of the Policy explains what automobiles are
    covered.  Section 2.1 reiterates the
    section 1.3 explanation that a “described automobile” is “any automobile or
    trailer specifically shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance”.  It also advises that the Certificate of
    Automobile Insurance shows the coverages purchased for each “described
    automobile.”  Section 2 lists various
    kinds of automobiles, such as a described automobile in section 2.1, and newly
    acquired automobiles and temporary substitute automobiles in section 2.2.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, section 1.8.3 states that “<span
style='line-height:200%'>[e]xcept for certain Accident
    Benefits<b> </b>coverage, there is no coverage under this<b> </b>policy if the
    automobile is rented or leased by you to another.”  </span>The Policy document thus does not
    address the situation of the Honda Civic that Choice leased from Tracmount.  Coverage was extended to leased vehicles by the
    Endorsement.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)       The Endorsement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Endorsement begins by providing in part (a),
    that “]t]he policy shall provide insurance” for all automobiles leased for more
    than 30 days if the insured as lessee is required to provide insurance pursuant
    to a written lease agreement.   Part (b)
    of the Endorsement obliges the insurer to provide specific coverages  “… for all automobiles covered under part
    (a)”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “Scope of Insurance Coverage” is addressed
    in parts (b) to (e) of the Endorsement.  Part (c) provides that there is no coverage for pre-Policy automobiles “NOT
    INCLUDED ON THE SCHEDULE OF AUTOMOBILES FILED WITH THE INSURER...” (emphasis in
    original). The Endorsement does not similarly require<i> </i>scheduling of automobiles leased after the Policy came into effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part (d) provides for an advance premium due at the
    effective date of the Policy.  Part (e)
    provides for the manner of calculation of the premium and part (f) requires
    Choice to file a monthly statement.  The
    italicized portions in parts (e) and (f) that follow were added by the parties
    to the form of endorsement: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) The premium for
    this Policy is based on the following rates per <u>   <i>Automobile Per Month</i>     </u> and the estimated total of <i>30</i><u>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </u></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New Roman";text-transform:uppercase'>The Application Judge’s Reasons </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected four arguments advanced
    on behalf of Lombard.  First, she
    rejected the argument that all leased cars were covered provided they came
    within part (a) of the Endorsement.  She
    concluded that this provision must be interpreted in light of the more specific
    requirements of the Policy that required a vehicle to be “described” and “specifically
    shown” on the Certificate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the application judge rejected Lombard’s
    argument that, since part (c) of the Endorsement included a requirement for the
    insured to schedule pre-Policy cars, the absence of such a requirement for cars
    subsequently leased meant that Choice was not required to schedule those
    cars.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, while the application judge recognized that the
    Endorsement required the reporting of an “actual amount” of vehicles in the
    monthly report, she rejected Lombard’s argument that the reporting requirement
    was solely quantitative.  Instead, she
    concluded that Choice was required to list the particulars of the automobiles
    on the monthly reports.  In arriving at
    this interpretation, the application judge relied on three documents.  First, she relied on the format of the actual
    monthly report for October 2004, the only monthly report filed on the
    application. That report contained columns of required information.  The columns were completed for the year,
    model, and serial number for 26 leased automobiles.  The columns for physical damage, date
    received, and date disposed were not completed.  Second, the application judge relied on the requirement set out in a
    Certificate issued to Tracmount as an additional insured, that vehicles be “designated”
    on Choice’s monthly reports.  Third, she
    referred to the Policy’s provision for coverage, which provided coverage for a
    “described” vehicle that was “specifically shown” on the Certificate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the application judge concluded that an insurer
    would need to know the particulars of the vehicles it was insuring because
    “[o]therwise, there would be a concern that an insured could claim insurance
    for a non-insured car.”  The application
    judge added, however, that this was “not to suggest that this is what occurred
    in this case.”</p>

    Application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent the interpretation of an insurance
    contract is purely a question of law, as it is in this case, it is reviewed on
    a standard of correctness.  See <i>Dunsmuir</i> <i>v. New Brunswick, </i>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 50. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of interpretation, reliance upon evidence
    extrinsic to the contract is only available if the interpretive process
    discloses an ambiguity that requires resolution.  See <i><span
style='line-height:200%'>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v.
    Novopharm Ltd.</span></i><span style='line-height:
200%'>; <i>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Apotex
    Inc., </i>[1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, at paras. 54 and 55.</span> This principle is
    not addressed in the reasons of the application judge.  To the contrary, her reasons relied on “four
    documents” to interpret the contract: the Policy, the Endorsement, the
    Tracmount Certificate, and the “Fleet Report”.  Indeed, both the Fleet Report and the Tracmount Certificate figured
    prominently in the application judge’s interpretation of the Zurich insurance
    contract.  </p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Fleet Report is clearly not part of the contract,
    which neither defined nor otherwise identified such a form.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>   Thus, absent an ambiguity, it cannot be
    considered in the interpretive process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the Tracmount Certificate cannot
    assist.  It was a one-page document
    entitled “Certificate of Insurance” that was addressed to Tracmount as an
    “additional insured”.  The Certificate
    certified to Tracmount that coverage applied “to <i>vehicles designated</i> on monthly reports submitted to the Insurer by
    the Policyholder” (emphasis added).  The
    emphasized words in the Certificate are important because they could be
    interpreted to require itemization of the individual vehicles in the
    fleet.  Indeed, this is the
    interpretation arrived at by the application judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Zurich issued the Tracmount Certificate to Tracmount.  It was was not addressed to Choice and was not
    part of the contract between Choice and Zurich. Counsel acknowledged that they
    “do not have” Choice’s Certificate of Automobile Insurance. There was no
    evidence that Choice’s Certificate was misplaced or that the information in the
    Tracmount Certificate was or would have been identical to any Certificate
    issued to Choice.  Not only was the
    Tracmount Certificate addressed to a different party, it was differently titled
    and provided significantly less detail than the form of Certificate of
    Automobile Insurance contemplated by the Policy and approved by the
    Superintendent of Financial Services.  In
    addition, by its own terms, the Tracmount Certificate was subordinate to “the
    terms, conditions and exclusions” of the Policy, including the Endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Choice’s Certificate of Automobile Insurance, if one
    existed, would have been useful in assisting the interpretive process as, by
    its terms, it forms part of the insurance contract.  The Policy defines it as a document
    “summarizing your insurance coverage” and listing the “coverages purchased,
    premiums charged, and the period during which the insurance is in effect.” The
    Policy repeatedly refers to the Certificate of Automobile Insurance as
    providing coverage for vehicles that it “specifically show[s]”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its absence, it is necessary for this court to
    undertake its own interpretation of the insurance contract based on the two relevant
    documents: the Policy and the Endorsement.    </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Principles
    of Insurance Contract Interpretation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foundation for the relevant principles and process
    for the interpretation of an insurance contract is <i>Consolidated Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery
    Insurance Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888.  At
    pp. 899 – 901 of that case, Estey J., writing for the majority, explains the
    two phases of the analysis for the interpretation of any contract, including an
    insurance contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first is the interpretive phase based on the
    guidelines for construction.  Subjective
    intention is irrelevant at this stage of the process, although the words used
    may be “possibly read in light of the surrounding circumstances which were
    prevalent at the time”: see <i>Eli Lilly</i>,
    at para.  54.  If the meaning is plain on the face of the
    contract, it is unnecessary to proceed further: see <i><span style='line-height:200%;color:black;
'>Non-Marine Underwriters,
    Lloyd’s of London v. Scalera</span></i><span style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 551, at para. 71.  </span>However, if the interpretive phase results in two equally
    reasonable interpretations, the contract is ambiguous.  In those circumstances, the court turns to
    the second phase of the inquiry.  At this
    phase, the court may consider extrinsic evidence: see <i>Eli Lilly</i>, at para. 55.  As
    well, the court may consider the applicability of <i>contra proferentem</i>: see <i>Consolidated
    Bathurst</i>, at p. 901.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>In the interpretive phase, the onus is upon the insured to show that the
    loss is covered by the policy in question.  Once the insured has done so, the burden shifts to the insurer to show
    otherwise, including by reason of the operation of an exclusion or limitation
    in the insurance contract: see <i>Continental
    Insurance Co. v. Dalton Cartage Co., </i>[1982] 1 S.C.R. 164; <i>Canadian National Railway Co. v. Royal and
    Sun Alliance Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 453, at para. 34; <i>Co-Operators Life Insurance Co. v. Gibbens, </i>[2009]
    3 S.C.R. 605, at para. 51; Denis Boivin, <i>Insurance
    Law</i> (Irwin Toronto: Irwin Law, 2004) at p. 190.<span style='color:black'>  In interpreting a provision, the court will
    also recognize that coverage provisions are “construed broadly and exclusion
    clauses narrowly”: see </span></span><i><span
style='line-height:200%;'>Reid Crowther &amp; Partners Ltd. v. Simcoe &amp;
    Erie General Insurance Co.</span></i><span style='line-height:200%;'>, </span><span

    para. 70.</span>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this onus in mind, the court turns to the first
    phase, the interpretive phase, the purpose of which is to discern the intention
    of the parties as gathered from the plain words used in the contract.  In doing so, the court considers the contract
    as a whole and in the “commercial atmosphere in which the insurance was
    contracted:” <i>Consolidated Bathurst</i>,<i> </i>at p. 901.<span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(c)       Interpretation
    of this Contract</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%;color:black'>An insurance contract must be considered in the light of its
    purpose.  The </span><span lang=EN-US>purpose of fleet insurance is not in dispute.  As applicable here, f</span>leet insurance
    provides coverage to the driver, rental company and lessor for a fleet of cars.  By its nature, the rental cars in a fleet
    change frequently by reasons of addition and attrition.  Rather than re-issuing the Certificate of
    Automobile Insurance on a monthly basis to accommodate such a changeover, a fleet
    Endorsement substitutes a requirement for the filing of a monthly fleet report
    with the insurer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    dispute in this case centres on the required content of the monthly report. Concerning
    this issue, the affidavit of Zurich’s “specialist</span>” stated that insurers
    would be prejudiced if rental companies only disclosed vehicles after they were
    in an accident.  However, the same
    “specialist” in the same affidavit also swore that it was of “vital commercial
    importance” for Zurich to know the “<i>number</i> of vehicles on the road” (emphasis added) that it insures. Not only is Zurich’s
    evidence contradictory on this point,<span lang=EN-US> there was no evidence that Choice knew anything about the details of
    the insurer’s objectives at the time it entered into the contract.  </span></p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this context, or lack of context, I turn to the
    Policy itself.  The Policy, it will be
    remembered, provides “specific coverage” or “particular coverage for a specific
    automobile” and defines a “described” automobile as one “specifically shown on
    your [or the] Certificate of Automobile Insurance” (s. 2.1 and s. 1.3).</p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, part (a) of the Endorsement, adding fleet
    coverage to the Policy, does not use this language of specificity.  Instead, the Endorsement provides coverage
    for licenced automobiles leased from any lessor for more than 30 days where the
    lease agreement requires Choice to provide automobile insurance.  Part (b) of the Endorsement obliges the
    insurer to provide coverage “for all automobiles covered under part (a)”.  </p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part (c) excludes coverage for those cars contained in
    a schedule of automobiles as at the effective date of the policy.  However, the requirement for scheduling does
    not apply to cars leased after the start date of the Policy, such as the Honda
    Civic.  Instead, for such cars, part (f)
    requires Choice to provide a monthly statement by the 15th day of the following
    month “of the actual amount of... Other... for the preceding month”.  “Other” refers back to part (e), which
    calculates the insurance premium based on rates per “<u>Automobile Per Month</u> and the estimated total of 30... vehicles reported monthly”.  The “Total Rate” in part (e) also describes
    the premium as calculated on the basis of “Per Vehicle Per Month”.  </p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I observe that the language of “<u>Automobile Per Month</u>”
    and “Per Vehicle Per Month” strongly indicates coverage based on the number
    rather than the particulars of the cars in the fleet.  While “actual amount” appears in the standard
    form endorsement, the additional language of quantification does not. It appears
    to have been purposefully added to the Endorsement by the parties. </p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Choice and Zurich opted against two other
    choices for rate calculation or risk assessment that were printed on the form:
    “Receipts” and “Mileage”. In doing so, the parties decided to assess the risk
    based on the number of cars in the fleet, rather than the amount of rental income
    or rental mileage for the relevant month.  This choice also informs the interpretation of
    the words of the insurance contract.</p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For two reasons, I am not persuaded to a different
    conclusion by Zurich’s argument that a description of each vehicle is necessary
    in the fleet insurance context for compliance purposes and to enable the
    insurer to rate the risk or premium based on the value of the particular
    automobile.  First, if such a term was
    necessary, Zurich could have required a detailed schedule of the particulars of
    the vehicles in the Endorsement.  This
    could have been accomplished simply by extending part (c), which denied
    coverage for unscheduled pre-Policy vehicles, to apply to vehicles leased
    subsequently.  In the alternative, it
    could have incorporated a description of the contents of the monthly report in
    the Endorsement or appended a required form for the report.</p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, by its terms, the Endorsement provides for
    monthly reports only on the 15th day of the following month.  Accordingly, the insurer could not know about
    the specific vehicles leased or surrendered during the Policy period for up to
    six weeks.  </p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the Policy provides a mechanism for the
    insurer to charge an additional premium in the event of an incorrect
    classification.  Thus, it is not
    prejudiced by receiving delayed information about the particulars of the
    fleet.  Also, the statutory conditions
    required Choice to notify Zurich of any change in the risk that is material to
    the contract.  Failure to comply carries
    serious consequences.<a href="#_ftn4"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  The availability of these and other
    mechanisms may explain why the parties agreed to the monthly reporting of the
    number of vehicles in the fleet.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=paragraphnumbered>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the parties contracted for monthly reports
    based upon the actual amount of vehicles in the fleet.  The parties’ deliberate decision on the plain
    language of the contract leaves no room for ambiguity.  Accordingly, this case is decided at the
    first phase of the <i>Consolidated Bathurst</i> analysis.  It is not necessary to go
    beyond the language of the contract to resort to other interpretive aids, such
    as the introduction of extrinsic evidence or the application of the <i>contra proferentem</i> doctrine.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>RESULT</b> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would allow the appeal and grant a
    declaration that, <span lang=EN-US>as between
    Zurich and Lombard, the Zurich</span> insurance contract provides coverage for
    the leased cars, the number of which Choice was obliged to report to Zurich in
    the monthly report described in the Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since neither Choice nor Ms. Noonan is a party to this
    application, this court cannot finally determine matters that would affect
    their interests.  Thus, the factual issue
    of whether Choice complied with its obligation to report the number of fleet
    vehicles, the applicability of other terms of the insurance contract, Ms.
    Noonan’s claim for relief from forfeiture and other issues affecting
    non-parties remain outstanding.  </p>
