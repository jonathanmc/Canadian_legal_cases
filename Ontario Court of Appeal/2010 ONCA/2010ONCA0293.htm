  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ARMSTRONG J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although not expressly requested by the parties, this
    case invites us to reconsider this court’s judgment in <i>Bellamy v. Johnson</i> (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 591(C.A.).   <i>Bellamy</i> set the ground rules for an
    order permitting the audio recording of a defence medical.  The circumstances of this case do not fall
    within the parameters of those ground rules and therefore we must consider
    whether the parameters should be changed.  The effect of the Divisional Court judgment, under appeal, is to provide
    for the recording of defence medical examinations in most, if not all, cases
    where a request is made.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident.  Her family doctor diagnosed her injury as
    cervical whiplash.  Counsel for the
    defendant sought an order to have the plaintiff examined by a specialist in
    physical medicine and rehabilitation (“the medical specialist”).  The plaintiff was agreeable but only on
    condition that the medical exam-ination would be audio recorded.  Counsel for the defendant did not accept the
    proposed condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the defendant moved in the Superior Court
    to compel the plaintiff to attend an examination by the medical specialist
    without any conditions.  Counsel for the
    plaintiff filed an affidavit that attached a letter he had written to counsel
    for the defendant in which he explained that the plaintiff’s rationale for the
    proposed conditions was based on his belief that the conditions were necessary
    to ensure fairness.  In his experience,
    defence medicals were used to gather admissions against interest from
    plaintiffs by a defence expert “in the guise of a defence health practitioner”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the plaintiff made no allegations against
    the particular medical specialist.  However, he supported his opinion on the basis that there was a systemic
    bias among health practitioners who undertook medical examinations for the
    defence.  He made reference to a number
    of instances where the doctor conducting a defence medical was no more than a
    “hired gun”.  He expressed concern that
    defence medical reports contained statements alleged to be made by injured
    plaintiffs, which, if contested, would create credibility issues.  In his opinion, these issues could be avoided
    by audio or video recording of the defence medical examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following excerpt from the letter of plaintiff’s
    counsel sets out what he describes as his firm’s experience in respect of the
    systemic bias that exists on the part of those engaged in conducting defence
    medical examinations.  Indeed, he refers
    to “the temptation to use corrupt practices and ulterior strategies”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With regret, this firm has experienced defence
    medical assessors making findings unsupported by the testing methods used or
    claimed to have been used during defence assessment.  These types of assessments have become a
    money making industry for health practitioners and the temptation to use
    corrupt practices and ulterior strategies is rife within the industry.  Admonishable and suspect defence medical
    assessor practices are easily precluded by audio taping and videotaping the
    assessments.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Often defence <span class=GramE>counsel refer</span> to these types of assessments as ‘independent medical examinations’.  Quite frankly, these examinations are
    anything but ‘independent’.  These
    assessors are paid a handsome sum (in the thousands of dollars and in some
    instances $10,000.00 or more) to conduct an examination and deliver a report.  The whole purpose of the exercise is focussed
    on damaging an injured Plaintiff’s cause of action or damages claim.  In this setting, asking that a defence
    medical report be audio taped and videotaped essentially is an exercise to
    preserve the integrity of truth, justice and fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The above statements were followed by reference to four
    cases of inappropriate conduct in respect of defence medicals.  None of the cases related to the medical
    specialist in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the motion in Superior Court, Justice John H.
    Brockenshire dismissed the defendant’s motion to conduct the defence medical
    without the proposed conditions.  He held
    that the affidavit of counsel for the plaintiff demonstrated, “the potential
    for a <i>bona fide</i> concern – that could
    be construed as compelling.”  In the
    result, he found the defendant had failed to establish that the proposed
    conditions were unreasonable or would interfere with the proposed examination.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>APPEAL TO THE DIVISIONAL COURT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant obtained leave to appeal the order of the
    motion judge to the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court observed that no specific
    allegation of abuse had been made against the medical specialist chosen by
    counsel for the defence.  No issue was
    raised in respect of the medical specialist’s credentials or credibility.  However, the court was persuaded to uphold
    the order of the motion judge on the basis of the evidence of general bias in
    the conduct of defence medicals as attested to in the affidavit of counsel for
    the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court also referred to the report of the
    Honourable Coulter A. Osborne and the concerns expressed by him in respect of
    expert evidence in civil actions generally.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court made extensive reference to the
    reasons for judgment in <i>Bellamy</i> and
    came to the following conclusion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We conclude that the <i>bona fide</i> reason for the request to record stipulated in <i>Bellamy v. Johnson</i> should not be
    interpreted to require a specific factual foundation of potential abuse or
    concern directly attacking the credibility of the doctor chosen by the defence,
    or identifying specific frailties of the plaintiff.  This approach necessarily becomes highly
    personal.  It is also an approach that is
    not required on the wording of the <i>Bellamy</i> decision itself, in which Doherty J. A. provided two scenarios where tape-recording
    would be appropriate.  Those scenarios
    were not exhaustive illus-trations, however.  We find that raising potential significant systemic problems also meets
    the onus upon the plaintiff that may found an order that a defence medical may
    be recorded.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that Bellamy governs
    this case but that that the Divisional Court misapplied the law as set out in <i>Bellamy</i>.  The respondent submits that <i>Bellamy</i> governs and that the courts below committed no error in its application.  Neither party asks us to revisit <i>Bellamy</i> and expand its reach to provide
    for recordings in the circumstances of this case.  That said, we have sat as a five judge panel
    and, in accordance with our practice, we are free to do so if we consider this
    an appropriate case. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court’s authority for ordering a medical
    examination of a party to a civil proceeding is found in s. 105 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, Chap.
    C.43 which provides: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>105(1) “Health Practitioner” defined – In this
    section, “health practitioner” means a person licensed to practise medicine or
    dentistry in Ontario or any other jurisdiction, a member of the College of
    Psychologists of Ontario or a person certified or registered as a psychologist by
    another jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) Order for physical or mental examination –
    Where the physical or mental condition of a party to a proceeding is in
    question, the court, on motion, may order the party to undergo a physical or
    mental examination by one or more health practitioners.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) Idem – Where the question of a party’s physical
    or mental condition is first raised by another party, an order under this
    section shall not be made unless the allegation is relevant to a material issue
    in the proceeding and there is good reason to believe that there is substance
    to the allegation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) Further examinations – The court may, on
    motion, order further physical or mental examinations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) Examiner may ask questions – Where an order is
    made under this section, the party examined shall answer the questions of the
    examining health practitioner relevant to the examination and the answers given
    are admissible in evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The procedure for obtaining an order under s. 105 is
    set out in <span class=GramE>rr</span>. 33.01 and 33.02 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>33.01 A motion by an adverse party for an order
    under section 105 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i> for the physical or mental examination of a party whose
    physical or mental condition is in question in a proceeding shall be made on
    notice to every other party.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>33.02(1) <span class=GramE>An</span> order under
    section 105 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> may specify the time, place and purpose of the exam-ination and shall name the
    health practitioner or practitioners by whom it is to be conducted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The court may order a second examination or
    further examinations on such terms respecting costs and other matters as are
    just.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Rule 33.05 provides that only the person being examined may
    attend such examination together with the examining health practitioner and his
    or her assistants unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to <i>Bellamy
    v. Johnson</i>.  In that case, the local
    master in London made an order permitting Mr. Bellamy to attend a defence
    medical examination with a tape recorder.  The master relied on statements in an affidavit filed by Mr. Bellamy’s
    lawyer and on the cross-examination of the lawyer.  The master concluded that “the demonstrated
    defence orientation of Dr. Peerless and the demonstrated lack of accuracy in
    his report satisfy the onus on the plaintiff”.  The master’s order was set aside on appeal to the High Court, which concluded
    that the evidence did not support the findings of the master.  An appeal to the Divisional Court was
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court dismissed the appeal from the Divisional Court.  Brooke J.A., writing for himself and
    Finlayson J.A., concluded that the master’s finding of the doctor’s defence
    orientation was “clearly wrong”.  In
    respect of the master’s finding of a “demonstrated lack of accuracy” in the
    doctor’s report, Brooke J.A. also concluded that it was unsupported by the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brooke J.A., at p. 594, was of the view that in a
    proper case, “the court has inherent jurisdiction to make such an order [for
    the tape recording of a defence medical examination] if justice required to
    ensure that the discovery provided by the section and the rules is
    facilitated.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brooke J.A. described the proper scope of an order
    permitting the tape recording of a defence medical at page 593 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the master had jurisdiction to make the
    order.  If there is a right to
    tape-record one’s conversations, that right is subject to the provisions of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, the Rules of
    Civil Procedure, and the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control the
    discovery process.  By virtue of the
    statute and the rules, the plaintiff is obliged to submit to physical or mental
    examination and to answer any relevant questions asked by the examiner.  The answers are admissible in evidence.  But the section and the rules are silent as
    to how the examination will be conducted.  I think it is contemplated that the examination will be carried out in
    the fashion that, in the judgment of the doctor, best facilitates the
    examination.  However, it must be kept in
    mind that the quality of the examination contemplated by the rules is not
    dependent upon the confidence which is the basis of a doctor/patient
    relation-ship.  It is, rather, dependent
    on the skill and integrity of the doctor in conducting the examination in a
    manner that will best facilitate discovery in the adversarial process.  The plaintiff has no right to determine how
    the examination is to be conducted or whether it is to be recorded.  However, the judgment of the doctor as to how
    the examination is to be conducted is not final, and the court has jurisdiction
    to set terms and conditions relating to the examination including a condition
    relating to the recording of the examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A. delivered concurring reasons in <i>Bellamy</i>.  At page 595, he set out the factors that he thought the court should
    take into account when deciding to permit the recording of a defence medical
    examination:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the opposing parties’ ability to learn the case it has
    to meet by obtaining an effective medical examination;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the likelihood of achieving a reasonable pre-trial
    settlement;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>the</span> fairness and effectiveness
    of the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Doherty J.A.’s view, the first factor is predominant.  In his view, an effective defence medical
    should produce the information set out in rule 33.06(1):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>After conducting an examination, the examining
    health practitioner shall prepare a written report setting out his or her
    observations, the results of any tests made and his or her conclusions,
    diagnosis and prognosis and shall forthwith provide the report to the party who
    obtained the order.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>If the tape recording would interfere with the ability of the
    medical examiner to obtain the information he or she requires to prepare a
    report in accordance with rule 33.06(1), the tape recording should not be
    permitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A. made it clear at page 596 of his reasons
    that the particular facts of each case will determine whether an order should
    be made:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Each application to permit tape-recording during
    the examin-ation will depend on its own facts.  If the moving party demonstrates the potential for a <i>bona fide</i> concern as to the reliability
    of the doctor’s or plaintiff’s account of any statements made during the
    examination, and if the moving party proposes a method and terms of recording
    the examination which would provide both parties with a full and accurate
    record of those statements in a timely fashion, then an order permitting the
    recording would be appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court in this case referred to the
    concurring reasons of Doherty J.A. in <i>Bellamy</i> and quoted liberally from them.  The
    Divisional Court pointed out that there was no evidence that the audio
    recording proposed in this case would interfere with the examination and no
    evidence that the doctor objected to it.  The Divisional Court concluded that audio recording the examination
    would “promote transparency and enable both counsel to be fully informed
    concerning the conduct of the examination.”  As indicated, the Divisional Court further noted that there was no
    evidence to suggest that the proposed medical specialist in this case had a
    history of abuse or bias and that his expertise and credibility were not
    subject to criticism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated in paragraph 11, <i>supra</i>, the Divisional Court concluded that Doherty J.A.’s reasoning
    in <i>Bellamy</i> did not “require a
    specific factual foundation of potential abuse or concern directly attacking
    the credibility of the doctor chosen by the defence”.  While I agree that it may not be necessary to
    attack the credibility of the doctor, there has to be something about the facts
    of the specific case that suggests to the court that an examination should be
    recorded.  It is not enough simply to
    allege general bias on the part of doctors who do defence medicals in order to
    obtain such an order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court then turned to the affidavit
    evidence filed by counsel for the plaintiff.  The Divisional Court was of the view that the affidavit evidence raised serious
    systemic problems.  It also agreed with
    the conclusion of the motion judge that the evidence “demonstrates the
    potential for a <i>bona fide</i> concern”.  The court observed that there is “a growing
    awareness of the significant difficulties with respect to proliferation of
    expert reports and potential bias and lack of objectivity with respect to
    expert evidence, particularly in personal injury cases.”  As already mentioned, the court noted the
    concerns expressed by the Honourable Coulter Osborne in his report.  At paragraph 21 of its reasons, the  Divisional Court referred to his
    recommendations as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Osborne Report makes several recommendations to
    address the problem including a requirement that all experts retained by either
    party certify in their report that their obligation is to the court, not to the
    client who is retaining them and paying their fees.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>I note that the Honourable Mr. Osborne did not recommend the
    routine recording of defence medical examinations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, both the Divisional Court and the motion
    judge made two errors.  The first error
    was in the interpretation of the reasons for judgment of Doherty J.A. in <i>Bellamy</i>.  As I have already said, I do not agree that Doherty J.A. contemplated
    orders to record medical examinations could be made based on anything other
    than the facts of a specific case.  The
    decision in <i>Bellamy</i> was made on the
    evidence or lack of evidence directly related to that case.  In my view, the Divisional Court’s treatment
    of <i>Bellamy</i> is tantamount to a
    rejection of its ratio.  The second error
    is directly related to the first.  By
    accepting the evidence of systemic bias, both the motion judge and the Divisional
    Court have not only extended the application of <i>Bellamy</i> beyond its limits, they have accepted that the medical
    specialist in this case is tainted with systemic bias.  While the Divisional Court has acknowledged
    that there was no attack on either his personal expertise or credibility, it
    concluded that the medical specialist was affected by the alleged bias of
    others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that the British Columbia Court of Appeal had
    occasion to comment on the alleged bias of medical experts in <i>Wong (Guardian Ad Litem of) v. Wong</i> [2006] B.C.J. No. 3123 (B.C.C.A.) in the context of an application for a
    defence medical.  The British Columbia
    Court of Appeal appears to have taken a different view from the Divisional
    Court in this case.  Finch, C.J.B.C.,
    writing for the court at paras. 40, 41 and 43 said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is in the nature of all expert evidence that
    opinions, based on the same factual basis, may differ in whole or in part or in
    degree.  This does not mean that the
    experts are biased in favour of one side or the other.  It reflects only the fact that the best
    medical science can offer is a high degree of probability, but never certainty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A fundamental premise for the admission of expert
    opinion evidence, whether tendered for the plaintiff or defence, is that it is <i>prima facie</i> objective and
    impartial.  That premise can of course be
    challenged by cross-examination or by contra-dictory evidence.  But in the typical case, differing opinions
    usually arise from honest, professional disagreements, and nothing more.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With those considerations in mind, I agree with the
    views of Brooke J.A. that the rules contemplate an examination conducted in a
    manner that “in the judgement of the doctor, best facilitates the examination.”  The quality of the examination is “dependent
    on the skill and integrity of the doctor in conducting an examination in a
    manner that will best facilitate discovery in the adversarial process.”  In the words of Doherty J.A., the most
    important consideration is “the opposing party’s ability to learn the case it
    has to meet by obtaining an effective medical evaluation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If <i>Bellamy</i> applies, the plaintiff has not proven specific facts that justify audio
    recording of the defence medical in <i>this
    case</i>.  [Emphasis added.]  On the basis of the two errors that I find
    were made by the Divisional Court, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
    original order of the motion judge and order the medical examination to proceed
    without conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> I recognize that
    this court constituted as a panel of five judges is in a position to broaden
    the application of <i>Bellamy</i> and, in
    effect, make the recording of defence medicals a more or less routine
    practice.  No doubt a case can be made
    for doing so.  Arguably, the litigation
    landscape has changed in the 18 years since <i>Bellamy</i> was decided.  Legitimate concerns have
    been expressed by the Honourable Coulter Osborne and others in respect of the
    role of experts in the civil litigation process.  The findings and recommendations of my
    colleague, Justice Goudge in his report, <i>Inquiry
    into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in Ontario: Report</i> (Toronto: Ontario
    Ministry of the Attorney General, 2008) suggest similar concerns arise in
    criminal cases.  Some contend that the
    routine recording of defence medicals and the transparency it produces would
    improve the discovery process.  Given the
    electronic world in which we now live, it is perhaps at least questionable
    whether the presence of a small recording device is likely to have any adverse
    affect on a medical specialist’s examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my view, the record in this case is
    insufficient to broaden and set new parameters for the making of orders
    requiring the recording of defence medical examinations, which would take into
    account all of the complexities and nuances that go with the conduct of such examinations.  First of all, I do not accept that the
    evidence of alleged systemic bias, as testified to by the plaintiff’s lawyer in
    this case, is sufficient to draw any general conclusions.  The evidence here provides the lawyer’s
    opinion of systemic bias in one area of the province and gives four specific
    examples.  The lawyer was not
    cross-examined on his affidavit because counsel for the defendant was of the
    view that little would be accomplished given the likely limits that would be
    placed on such cross-examination by the deemed undertaking rule and
    solicitor/client privilege.  In my view,
    a number of other questions arise should the court attempt to define the
    expanded parameters of an order for the recording of defence medicals:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If such an order is made on a more or less routine
    basis, should the court order that subsequent medical examinations by expert
    doctors retained by the plain-tiff <span class=GramE>be</span> subject to the
    same requirement?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What else can be done to “level the playing field” for
    the defendant in respect of medical examinations by plaintiff’s experts?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What about unrecorded medical examinations that have
    been done by the plaintiffs’ experts prior to the defence seeking an order for
    a medical?  The concern here is that
    routine recording of the defence medical will give the plaintiff an unfair
    tactical advantage.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What obstacles, if any, are there to the conduct of an
    effective medical examination if all examinations are routinely recorded?  Is it possible to generalize or are we driven
    back to the position of Doherty J.A. that what is involved is a case specific
    analysis?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why did the Honourable Coulter Osborne not make a
    recommendation that defence medicals be routinely recorded?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will the reforms related to expert witnesses
    recom-mended by Coulter Osborne and implemented by amendments to the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> be sufficient
    to deal with the perceived problems concerning defence medical experts?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How can the views of the medical profession be
    comprehensively canvassed together with the views of The Advocates’ Society,
    the Ontario Trial Lawyers Association, <span class=GramE>the</span> American
    College of Trial Lawyers, the Canadian Medical Protective Association, the
    Medico-Legal Society and other interested organiza-tions?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A case such as this is not the best place to address
    these issues.  This is a matter that is
    best studied by the Civil Rules Committee, which has just spent more than a
    year considering the Osborne recommendations.  The Rules Committee is better able to canvass the views of the
    interested groups province-wide and make reasonable recom-mendations, if so
    advised.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not expand the scope of <i>Bellamy</i> in order to support the routine recording of defence
    medicals.  While arguments of a general
    nature can be advanced, the record in this case does not support it.  The evidence here contains counsel’s opinion
    based on what would appear to be the fairly narrow experience (four cases) of
    one law firm.  It is acknowledged by
    counsel for the plaintiff that the concerns expressed in respect of the bias of
    medical practitioners who undertake defence medicals are not an evident concern
    in respect of the medical specialist proposed by the defendant.  To put it bluntly, there is not a scintilla
    of evidence that he is a “hired gun”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, I would allow the appeal, set aside

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the agreement of counsel, I would

style='line-height:200%'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this personal injury action, the defendant
    moved for an order, without the imposition of any conditions, that the
    plaintiff attend an examination by the defendant’s medical examiner.  The defendant opposed a condition permitting
    the plaintiff to record the examination.  On the basis of the plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence of systemic problems
    with the reliability of defence medical opinions, the motion judge exercised
    his discretion to grant the defence medical, but subject to the condition that
    the plaintiff be permitted to record the examination.  The Divisional Court upheld the motion judge’s
    exercise of discretion. The defendant appeals to this court.  I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=ssl21><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the record in this
    case, together with increased awareness about the partisan nature of expert
    evidence, supports the conclusion that a</span></span> plaintiff should be
    allowed to audio record a defence medical if that recording would advance the
    interests of justice.  Generally, a
    recording advances the interests of justice by providing the parties with a
    reliable record of the examination, which will serve to enhance their
    settlement discussions as well as the effectiveness of trial.  However, the interests of justice are not
    enhanced if the recording would compromise the examiner’s ability to conduct an
    effective medical examination.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Motion Judge’s Decision </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After considering the decision of this court in <i>Bellamy v. Johnson</i> (1992), 8 O.R. (3d)
    591, the motion judge concluded that the “[d]efence has not produced any
    evidence to show that the ... recording ... would in any way interfere with the
    proposed [examination]” and that the condition permitting recording of the
    defence medical was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion was consistent with the unchallenged
    evidence on behalf of the plaintiff that defence medical reports have become
    “lengthy epistles”, significant portions of which consist of “alleged
    statements that the injured plaintiff made to the defence medical
    assessor”.  Counsel on behalf of the
    “unsophisticated” plaintiff took the position that this type of one-sided record
    keeping by an examiner created a potential credibility conflict about what was
    actually and said done during the examination.  He argued that a recording of the examination would provide a means of
    verifying its contents.  This would
    preclude any allegation such as an allegation that the examiner’s report either
    “neglected or ignored” the plaintiff’s account of the examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the motion, the plaintiff agreed to provide an
    unedited copy of the recording to the defendant’s counsel in a timely
    manner.  She also undertook to record and
    to provide the defendant with a copy of any future expert examinations that
    responded to the defence medical.<a href="#_ftn2"

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a>  Since the plaintiff had no earlier medical
    examinations, other than by her treating doctor, there was no suggestion that
    recording the defence medical would somehow be unfair to the defendant.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court’s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In upholding the motion judge’s decision, the
    Divisional Court observed that the supporting affidavit filed by counsel on
    behalf of the plaintiff illustrated “disturbing examples of abuse by medical
    experts in other personal injury cases in [the plaintiff’s counsel’s] law firm”
    and referred to evidence that “serious systemic problems” were said to have
    “caused significant difficulties in the lawsuits in question.”  In addition, the Divisional Court addressed
    the “growing awareness” of the lack of objectivity in expert reports and
    expressed concern about the “hired gun” approach of defence examiners,
    particularly in personal injury cases.  The Divisional Court also noted “the problematic dynamics inherent in
    defence medicals” and cited the recommendations to promote objectivity in
    expert reports by the Honourable Coulter A. Osborne in the <i>Civil Justice Reform Project: Summary of Findings and Recommendations</i> (Toronto: Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, 2007) (the Osborne Report).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span class=ssl21><span lang=EN-US
style='color:windowtext'>ANALYSIS</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendant based the appeal on the interpretation of
    this court’s decision in <i>Bellamy</i>.  I will first address that interpretation and
    then consider the reasons to permit or refuse a recording condition in an order
    for a defence medical.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Bellamy Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague, Armstrong J.A., interprets this court’s
    decision in <i>Bellamy</i> to hold that a
    recording condition will be granted only when the plaintiff establishes actual
    bias on the part of the defence examiner, or another reason that is particular
    to the facts of the case.  To support
    this interpretation, he relies on the concurring reasons in <i>Bellamy</i> at p. 596, where Doherty J.A.
    said that the disposition of an application to record “will depend on its own
    facts” and that an order to record will be appropriate if the moving party
    demonstrates “the potential for a bona fide concern as to the reliability of
    the doctor’s or plaintiff’s account” of the examination.  Based on these extracts, Armstrong J.A.
    concludes that Doherty J.A. did not contemplate that orders to record medical
    examinations could be based on “anything other than the facts of a specific
    case” and that the Divisional Court in this case erred in interpreting <i>Bellamy</i> otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that a recording condition may be imposed for a
    case-specific reason.<a href="#_ftn3"

style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[3]</span></span></span></span></a>  However, I do not read Doherty J.A.’s reasons
    to preclude a recording condition based on broader grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although<i> </i>Doherty
    J.A. referred to the reliability of “the doctor’s or plaintiff’s” account of
    the examination, as opposed to the more general terminology of “a” doctor and
    “a” plaintiff, this wording must be considered in the context of the
    argument.  In that </p>
  <p class=ParaNo0><span class=GramE>case</span>, the plaintiff argued that the
    proposed defence examiner had displayed an actual defence orientation.  In my view, because Doherty J.A. was dealing
    with an allegation against <i>the </i>doctor,
    he did not refer to <i>a </i>doctor.  In that context, the extract cannot be
    interpreted to restrict the grounds for a recording condition to case-specific
    concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find support for this interpretation in Doherty
    J.A.’s further observation that a recording condition is not the appropriate
    remedy where the plaintiff demonstrates that the particular proposed examiner
    has shown a defence orientation.  In such
    a case, Doherty J.A. concludes at p. 597 that the examination should not be
    recorded but the examiner replaced.  He
    explains that “[f]airness to all involved in the process demands no less.”  If the remedy for case-specific bias is
    removal of the examiner, there is little point in ordering a recording of the
    examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Doherty J.A.’s reasons, taken in context,
    focused on the purpose of the defence medical: to assist the defendant in
    learning about the plaintiff’s case. With this purpose in mind, Doherty J.A.
    provided at p. 596 that a court should consider the impact a recording would
    have on:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.&nbsp;        <span
class=GramE>the</span> opposing party’s ability to learn the case it has to
    meet by obtaining an effective medical evaluation;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.&nbsp;        <span
class=GramE>the</span> likelihood of achieving a reasonable pre-trial
    settlement;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.&nbsp;        <span
class=GramE>the</span> fairness and effectiveness of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it was not Doherty J.A. but Brooke J.A. who
    wrote for the majority in <i>Bellamy</i>.  He did not address the test proposed by
    Doherty J.A. Instead, he dealt primarily with the question of
    jurisdiction.  In addition, while he
    found no evidence to support the plaintiff’s allegation of actual bias, he
    concluded that a case-specific basis was a pre-condition for obtaining a recording
    condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brooke J.A. explicitly rejected the notion that a
    recording would be justified simply because there was a risk that the plaintiff
    and the doctor may have differing recollections of what took place at the
    examination.  He wrote at p. 595:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It is suggested that since there is evidence of such
    disputes [i.e. over the accuracy of the selected assessor’s reports] it would
    be proper to make an order permitting the plaintiff to tape-record the
    examination.  I think it would be wrong
    to do so.  It was not the appellant’s
    case here or below that the evidence of such disputes was all that was needed
    to win the day.  While the rule requires
    that the doctor make a report and that a copy be delivered to the plaintiff,
    the record of what occurred lies in the evidence of the parties.  I think the rules proceed on the basis that
    there may be some disparity between the memory of the doctor and the memory of
    the plaintiff from time to time.  </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The system has worked well in this regard, as is evident
    from the absence of any change in the recent revision of the rules of
    practice.  There is no suggestion on the
    record before us that any injustice has occurred.  To make an order in the circumstances of
    these appeals is almost to write an addendum to the rules.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although one might now query the assumption that the
    “system has worked well in this regard”, Brooke J.A. appears to foreclose the
    possibility that orders to record can be granted based on the need for a
    reliable record, without something more.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it is the concurring reasons of Doherty J.A.
    that are generally cited in subsequent decisions as providing the legal
    test.  For example, see <i>Willits v. Johnston</i> (2003), 121 A.C.W.S.

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Revisiting<i> Bellamy </i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The </span>Chief
    Justice constituted this five-judge panel specifically so that it could
    reconsider the principles in <i>Bellamy</i>.  In light of the developments since <i>Bellamy</i> was decided 18 years ago, that
    reconsideration should take place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, it appears that the majority in <i>Bellamy</i> concluded that a case-specific
    reason or bias on the part of the proposed examiner is required.  <span lang=EN-US>I</span>n my view, any requirement for a case-specific bias on the part
    of a defence examiner is overly-restrictive for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it is unreasonable to expect that an individual
    plaintiff or a plaintiff’s lawyer could amass the data necessary to support
    such an allegation.  Such an undertaking
    would be inordinately difficult, expensive and time-consuming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in <i>Bellamy </i>at p. 593, Brooke J.A. quoted the Divisional Court’s statement that a
    defence orientation “is immaterial short of misconduct that should be subject
    to a report to the College of Physicians and Surgeons”.  If it is necessary to prove a defence
    orientation to the level of professional misconduct, rarely would a court
    impose a recording condition when ordering a defence medical.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the inevitably personal nature of an attack
    alleging actual bias, if unsuccessful, could put the plaintiff at risk of
    alienating the examiner who will pronounce on his or her medical
    condition.  The plaintiff may unnecessarily
    be left with an increased concern about the examiner’s ability to report
    objectively.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    relevant considerations for a recording condition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, in my view, the nature of the
    relationship between the plaintiff and the examiner, the changes in approach to
    expert reports, the advances in technology, and the advantages to be gained by
    an accurate record all <span lang=EN-US>lead
    inevitably to the conclusion that a recording condition to a defence medical is
    generally in the interests of justice, absent any adverse impact on the
    examiner’s ability to conduct an effective examination.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (a)
          The relationship between the
    plaintiff and the examiner</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Doherty J.A. explained at p. 598 of <i>Bellamy</i>, there are important differences
    between the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defence
    examiner and one between a patient and a treating doctor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The patient/treating physician relationship is a
    long-term one that builds the trust and confidence essential to an open
    discussion about the patient’s condition and informs decisions about
    appropriate treatment.  In such a
    relationship, the patient discloses personal information with the expectation
    that the physician will keep it private and confidential and will not repeat it
    publicly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, a plaintiff in a lawsuit is not the
    patient of the examiner, who is chosen by the defendant.  The p<span lang=EN-US>u</span>rpose of the examination is to provide the defendant with
    information to test the plaintiff’s allegation of physical or mental damage and
    not to propose treatment.  The plaintiff
    generally sees the examiner only once.  In light of their roles, the plaintiff expects that the examiner’s
    opinion may well support the defendant’s position and minimize the extent of
    the injuries.  The plaintiff also knows
    that the history and complaints he or she presents to the defendant’s examiner
    will later be disclosed to counsel, used in settlement discussions and publicly
    aired in a courtroom.  To the extent the
    examiner’s opinion is based on what the plaintiff says and does during the examination,
    the plaintiff may expect that, consciously or subconsciously, the examiner will
    rely on those observations that most support his or her opinion.  Thus, the plaintiff is in an adversarial
    relationship with the examiner hired by her opponent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking at the relationship in this light, the
    importance of keeping an accurate record of the examination is evident.  Such a recording is necessary because it
    gives the defendant the foundation for the examiner’s opinion and equips the
    plaintiff with the necessary information with which to test the reliability and
    objectivity of the examiner’s report and opinion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (b)       Relevant
    changes since 1992</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Changes
    since </span><i>Bellamy</i> also support
    adding a recording condition to an order for a defence medical.  I will discuss three of the most salient
    changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the importance of transparency in expert reports
    as well as accountability of experts for their opinions is now
    incontrovertible.  When <i>Bellamy</i> was decided, an examiner’s
    evidence regarding the contents of his or her report would have been akin to
    “gospel.”  Brooke J.A. concluded in <i>Bellamy</i> that disputes about the
    examination could be resolved by the “evidence of [the] parties” about what
    occurred.  Presumably, the examiner would
    rely on the notes taken during the examination.  This presumes, however, that the examiner is both a reliable and
    objective record keeper.  We now know
    that this presumption, and the <i>Bellamy</i> view that “the system has worked well”, have unfortunately been proven wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognition of concerns about the reliability of expert
    opinion is evident from several inquiries into wrongful convictions, including
    the inquiry by our colleague Goudge J.A. His report, <i>Inquiry into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in Ontario: Report</i> (Toronto: Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, 2008) (the Goudge Report),
    particularly at Vol. II, pp. 179 – 192, addressed cases arising from the once
    highly-regarded paediatric forensic pathology opinions given by Dr. Charles
    Smith.  The Goudge Report, as well as
    other cases involving wrongful convictions, has demonstrated weaknesses in
    expert opinion that can result from faulty factual assumptions, from the
    application of unreliable science or technique or from a particular examiner’s
    agenda.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar concerns about expert partisanship have been
    raised on the civil side.  Although the
    Osborne Report did not deal with the minutiae of recording defence medicals,
    and while it recognized that not all experts should be tarred with the same
    brush, the Report specifically observed at p. 71 that it was a “common
    complaint” that “too many experts are no more than hired guns who tailor their
    reports as evidence to suit the client’s needs.”  Precisely by reason of concern about “hired
    guns”, the Osborne Report made significant recommendations to promote expert
    objectivity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, in 1992 expert examiners were seen to be more
    or less inherently trustworthy and objective.  In 2010, it is recognized that examiners make assumptions and base their
    opinions on factors that the plaintiff should be able to challenge through
    cross-examination rendered effective by the provision of an accurate record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the technology has changed dramatically.  In <i>Bellamy</i>,
    the proposed examiner objected to a recording condition on the basis that the
    technology would physically interfere with the flow of the examination.  In his concurring reasons, Doherty J.A.
    rejected this as a significant concern, noting at p. 597 that “tape-recorders
    are compact and tapes can be made for well over an hour without any interruption.”
    Of course, in 2010, high quality digital recording is even less obtrusive, less
    costly, and more user-friendly than older technology.  At the same time, it enables recordings that
    are more easily copied and transferred and are sufficiently unlimited in
    duration to meet the requisite purpose.  Once activated, a device need not be touched again until the end of the
    recording session, and the digital files are easy to manage once completed.  Any technology-based concerns voiced in 1992,
    even if valid then, are moot today.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we as a society have become inured to being
    recorded.  Proceedings at the Court of
    Appeal for Ontario and the Supreme Court of Canada are now digitally
    recorded.  Our conversations are recorded
    every time we call a major company for customer support.  911 calls are recorded, as are police
    interviews.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></span></a>  Our movements at ATM machines, in
    institutional buildings, and many other locations, are routinely
    videotaped.  There are police cameras
    posted at problematic intersections in our cities.  Incidents and events are now captured on cell
    phone cameras and distributed on the internet within minutes. For security and
    other reasons, society finds these recordings largely acceptable.  As Armstrong J.A. wryly put it at para. 28,
    “given this electronic world in which we now live, it is perhaps at least
    questionable whether the presence of a small recording device is likely to have
    any adverse affect on a medical specialist’s examination.”</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       Other reasons to permit recording</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are further sound reasons to favour the recording
    of defence medicals. The purpose of discovery in the litigation process is to
    give the parties an opportunity to learn and test the parameters of the
    opponent’s case.  Oral discovery of a
    party by opposing counsel is recorded and takes place in the presence of the
    party’s counsel.  As Doherty J.A. noted
    at p. 595 of <i>Bellamy</i>, defence
    medicals are “an integral part of the discovery process”.  On that basis, there seems to be no
    principled reason why an examination for discovery conducted by a defence
    lawyer is recorded while a medical examination for discovery conducted by a
    defence examiner is not, unless of course the recording would
    disproportionately compromise the effectiveness of the defence medical.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the normal course, the elimination of disputes about
    the content of a defence medical, with regard to both the plaintiff’s history
    and the examiner’s techniques, would assist the truth-seeking and fact-finding
    function of the examination, as well as promote full, frank and informed
    settlement discussions.  It would also
    promote trial fairness by levelling the playing field between the usually
    unsophisticated plaintiff and the usually articulate examiner whose evidence is
    perceived by many to be accompanied by an aura of expertise and wisdom.  A recording would also eliminate the expense
    and delay that would be otherwise spent at trial resolving factual disputes
    about the foundation for the expert’s opinion or to learn and challenge the
    method and technique employed by the examiner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note as a matter of common sense that
    recording defence medicals protects the examiner as well as the plaintiff.  It seems evident that it is in the examiner’s
    interest to create an independent, objective record of what transpired during
    the examination.  Such a record would be
    welcomed by most examiners.  It would
    also serve to insulate the examiner from unmeritorious challenges to his or her
    opinion, as well as complaints to his or her professional body.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, an order for a defence medical
    should include a condition permitting the plaintiff to record the examination
    unless the motion judge is persuaded that the recording would compromise the
    examiner’s ability to learn the plaintiff’s case about his or her physical or
    mental condition.  The accuracy of the
    recording can be ensured by extending the recording permission sought by the
    plaintiff to the examiner. Alternatively, the plaintiff can be required to
    provide a copy of the recording at the conclusion of, or shortly after, the
    examination.  Further conditions could be
    stipulated, if appropriate, including requiring the provision of a transcript
    of the recording in a timely manner.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Armstrong
    J.A.’s reasons not to re-visit <i>Bellamy</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In his
    reasons, Armstrong J.A. raises various concerns he thinks should be addressed
    before revisiting the <i>Bellamy</i> decision.  I respond as follows:</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Is the record in this case
    sufficient to decide the issue?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=ssl21><span style='line-height:200%'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The unchallenged affidavit on behalf of
    the plaintiff was replete with concerns about systemic bias. That evidence is
    consistent with the observations of the Osborne Report and the Goudge Inquiry,
    both of which raise clear concerns about ensuring the objectivity of expert
    opinion.  The court is entitled to
    consider this broader context and to take judicial notice of these concerns in
    this case.  See for example <span
class=bold1><i><span style='line-height:200%;font-weight:normal'>R. v. Spence</span></i></span><span
class=bold1><span style='line-height:200%;font-weight:
normal'>, </span></span><span class=ssl21><span style='line-height:200%'>[2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 30,
    where the Supreme Court refers to <i>R. v.
    Williams</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R.  1128,
    where it took judicial notice of reports from Commissions and Inquiries.</span></span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Is the Rules Committee an appropriate forum to decide the question?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Armstrong J.A. that the Rules Committee,
    if it chooses to do so, is well-placed to undertake a full consultation with a
    wide variety of interested organizations about the merits of recording defence
    medicals. Nonetheless, the silence of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> on this issue leaves the inclusion of a recording
    condition within the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control the
    discovery process.  In my view, this
    court should exercise its jurisdiction in this case based on the current
    record.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Should the court impose a further condition that subsequent
    examinations by the plaintiff’s expert doctors <span class=GramE>be</span> subject to the same requirement?  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the plaintiff undertook to record any
    examinations that responded to the defence medical.  Accordingly, Armstrong J.A.’s suggested
    condition is not necessary.  However,
    subject to the motion judge’s exercise of discretion in a particular case, the
    benefits of recording, which I have canvassed above, would apply equally to
    examinations conducted by the plaintiff’s examiner.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>What else can be done to otherwise “level the playing field” for the
    defendant in respect of medical examinations by the plaintiff’s experts?  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this question is largely answered by the
    reciprocity arrangement offered in this case in which the plaintiff undertakes
    to record her own expert litigation examinations.  Any additional conditions required to ensure
    fairness would be within the discretion of the motion judge on a case-by-case
    basis.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>What about earlier unrecorded medical examinations by the
    plaintiff’s experts?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a general proposition, one does not cure a
    plaintiff’s potential lack of candour in an earlier examination by his or her
    own expert by ensuring an equal opportunity for a lack of candour in a later
    examination by the defendant’s expert.  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> this issue is not relevant to this
    case because there were no earlier plaintiff’s expert medical
    examinations.  In any event, if the
    plaintiff’s prior history would somehow render the recording condition unfair
    to the defendant, the motion judge would take this into account in arriving at
    an appropriate disposition.  It may be
    said, as a practical matter, that plaintiffs who may want to record later
    defence medicals should consider recording their own litigation-oriented expert
    examinations, or else be prepared to explain why they chose not to do so.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Are there any obstacles presented by a recording order to the
    conduct of a defence medical?     </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the proposed defence examiner filed no
    evidence.  Thus, there is no indication
    that recording the defence medical would adversely affect the examination or
    the resulting report in any way.  It may
    be different in another case.  For
    example, in <i>Bellamy</i> it was argued
    that recording a defence medical could stifle spontaneity, interrupt the flow,
    or otherwise adversely affect the examination.  However, as I have explained, given the adversarial nature of the
    plaintiff/examiner encounter, these concerns are not relevant in most
    cases.  In the normal course, a recording
    should not change the questions the examiner asks, the answers the plaintiff
    gives, the technique the examiner employs, or otherwise compromise the content
    of the defence medical examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other cases, masters and motion judges will be able
    to consider any allegation that the proposed recording would disproportionately
    impair the examiner’s ability to conduct the examination.  See, for example, <i>Jilla v. Ribeiro </i>(2009), 75 C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>) 107 (Ont.
    S.C.), where the master refused to allow a recording on the grounds that that
    there was a real risk that the plaintiff would “play” for the camera, given the
    plaintiff’s established history of exaggerating the severity of his impairment
    in interviews with psychiatrists.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>The scope of the Osborne Report  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Osborne Report did not address the recording of
    defence medicals as an issue one way or the other, although it raised concerns
    about “hired guns”.  In any event, the
    Osborne Report recommendations were not meant to be exhaustive.  In addition, the law is a continually
    evolving process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, I am not persuaded that this court should
    refuse permission to record the defence medical in this case by reason of the
    concerns raised by Armstrong J.A.</p>
