style='line-height:200%'>is a highly regarded
    paediatric dental surgeon.  On May 26,
    2003, she fell and broke her wrist in a corridor of the William Osler Health
    Centre, one of the respondents.  Her
    wrist was placed in a cast for six weeks and she underwent physiotherapy for
    five months.  The trial judge found the respondents liable for the wrist injury
    arising out of Dr. Hibberd’s fall and awarded her pecuniary and non-pecuniary
    damages.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>With respect to loss of income, the trial judge found that
    Dr. Hibberd’s revenue and net income dropped in 2003, as compared to 2002, as
    well as in 2007, as compared to 2006.  On
    this analysis, the trial judge found that the income loss for Dr. Hibberd for
    2003 was $132,246.  He examined her 2007
    loss and future loss somewhat differently. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Hibberd made no claim for income loss in 2004, 2005, and
    2006 because she was able to resume a full practice in those years and worked
    extensively. In 2006, however, she began to experience increasing pain and
    difficulties with her left wrist that became more prominent in 2007 and
    continued to the time of trial.  As a
    result, she claimed a loss of income for this period as well as for future
    loss. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>While the trial judge found that a “large part of the drop
    [in Dr. Hibberd’s revenue in 2003] can be attributed to the impact of her
    injury on her ability to practice”, he did not come to a similar conclusion for
    the period following the end of 2006.   Rather, the trial judge was of the view “that the increased pain which
    she has experienced and continues to experience has not resulted in an income
    loss to her”.  Accordingly, he denied her
    loss of income claims for 2007 and for the future.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Dr. Hibberd appeals from the
    judgment with respect to the award made for past and future loss of
    income.  She does not appeal the trial
    judge’s assessment of her income loss for 2003 and states that the trial judge
    applied the correct approach in determining this loss.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The core of Dr. Hibberd’s argument on appeal is
    that the trial judge erred in inexplicably using two different approaches to
    calculate her loss of income from 2007 to the time of trial, and to calculate
    her future loss of income.  More
    specifically, Dr. Hibberd raises three separate arguments.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>First, Dr. Hibberd submits that
    the trial judge used the wrong approach to assess income loss for 2007.  She argues that he should have approached
    this in the same fashion as he approached the claim for income loss for 2003,
    and as advanced by the experts.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Second, Dr. Hibberd contends that
    the trial judge’s reasons for assessing the 2007 loss are insufficient to allow
    for appellate review.  On this issue, the
    respondents fairly concede that while this was not a ground of appeal set out
    in Dr. Hibberd’s notice of appeal, they are not prejudiced by allowing it to be
    advanced.  Given this, Dr. Hibberd was
    granted leave to argue the issue of inadequacy of reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Third, Dr. Hibberd contends that </span>the trial judge erred by failing to apply
    the “real and substantial risk” test in considering future income loss.  She says that he failed to consider early
    retirement as a factor that could result in a future loss, and erred in
    “speculating as to Dr. Hibberd’s likely age of retirement”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would
    not give effect to any of these grounds of appeal and in the result I would
    dismiss the appeal.  As I will make
    clear, the trial judge decided the issues of income loss for 2007 and future
    loss of income on the basis of causation and not on the manner of
    calculation.  In doing so, it is my view
    that it was unnecessary for him to explain - beyond that which he did - his
    approach to calculating such loss.  Furthermore,
    because the trial judge decided these issues in the manner he did, I find that
    his reasons adequately allow for appellate review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I am satisfied that the trial judge did apply the “real and substantial risk”
    test in considering future income loss.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Loss
    of income for 2007 and future</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the root of Dr. Hibberd’s submission is that
    at trial both parties’ experts agreed that the proper approach to calculating
    past income loss was to count the number of procedures performed during the
    relevant period when Dr. Hibberd was disabled and then compare that number to a
    period when Dr. Hibberd was not disabled.  The average fee for a procedure would be multiplied by the number of
    procedures in order to generate a specific figure.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Indeed, the trial judge adopted this approach for the period
    in 2003 and agreed with Dr. Hibberd’s expert that the proper comparator time
    period was 2002.  He looked at Dr.
    Hibberd’s loss of income stemming directly from her inability to perform, as
    well as indirect losses stemming from the impact of her unavailability on the
    work completed by hygienists, from which she also earns income.  He then accepted the estimate of income loss
    in 2003 provided by Dr. Hibberd’s expert witness. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge then addressed the situation in 2007.   He noted </span>that both revenue and net
    income decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006.  He also alludes to the calculations by the experts of both parties that
    show a decrease in both net income and general revenues and the net loss of
    income.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:
200%;'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;"Times New Roman";'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a>  Nevertheless, while the trial judge accepted
    that Dr. Hibberd’s wrist pain increased toward the end of 2006, he found that
    this was not the cause of her income loss in 2007.  He based this conclusion on his findings that
    Dr. Hibberd <span style='line-height:200%;'>had adequately accommodated her practice to her pain and that her loss of
    income was not attributable to her wrist injury.  To challenge his conclusion, the appellant
    must demonstrate that the trial judge erred in making these findings.  In my view, he made no such error.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    accepted, he found that:</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He found that while no single factor was
    determinative, all of them together more than accounted for the decrease in Dr.
    Hibberd’s income in 2007.  He then makes
    the critical conclusion at para. 153, that he was “unable to find that Dr.
    Hibberd’s loss of income for 2007 as compared with 2006 was attributable to the
    injury to her wrist”.  <span
style='line-height:200%'>In my view, this conclusion
    on causation was one he was entitled to reach, and was amply supported by the
    evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, there
    was no error in the trial judge’s approach to or calculation of Dr. Hibberd’s
    2007 income loss.  He simply found that
    Dr. Hibberd’s wrist injury was not the cause in fact of any decline in her income
    in this period. There is no reason that I can discern, nor has one been
    advanced, that prohibited the trial judge from making such a finding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the same reasons, the trial judge then went on to
    find that there was no future annual income loss attributable to Dr. Hibberd’s
    wrist injury.  He therefore rejected her
    claims for future loss of income going forward to retirement.  Specifically, at para. 160, he concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Because I have determined that Dr. Hibberd did not
    suffer an income loss in 2007 resulting from her injury, I am unable to accept
    the submission that she will suffer any annual income loss in the future, let
    alone one of $114,724.00 for each year until her retirement, whenever that may
    be.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, this was a finding he was entitled to make,
    which was sufficiently supported by the evidence.  And, relying on the same analysis I undertook
    in connection with Dr. Hibberd’s 2007 loss of income, I again find he made no
    error in respect of her future loss of income. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, I conclude that there is no merit to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       Sufficiency
    of reasons</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can deal briefly with the sufficiency of the trial
    judge’s reasons.  Simply put, given that
    the trial judge decided the issues of loss of income for 2007 and the future on
    the basis of causation and not calculation, I find that his reasons more than
    adequately allow for appellate review.  I
    would, therefore, reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Real
    and substantial risk</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Hibberd contends that the trial judge
    ignored his obligation to determine if there was a “real and substantial risk”
    of Dr. Hibberd sustaining a future income loss.  She argues that rather than undertaking this required analysis, the
    trial judge simply concluded that “because” he found no loss of income in the
    year 2007, Dr. Hibberd did not have a future loss of income.  Specifically,
    as I noted earlier, she argues that the trial judge failed to consider early
    retirement as a factor, and “speculated as to Dr. Hibberd’s likely age of retirement”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The trial judge in fact did consider early
    retirement as a factor that could result in a future loss, and he did not
    speculate as to Dr. Hibberd’s likely age of retirement.  Indeed, as set out in the trial judge’s
    reasons, cited at para. 18 above, he expressly concluded that there was no
    basis for finding any annual income loss in the future until retirement
    “whenever that may be”.  There was,
    therefore, no need to consider the age at which Dr. Hibberd would likely
    retire.  His reasons more than
    demonstrate this. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge then considered the medical evidence that Dr. Hibberd may have some
    difficulties with her wrist in the future.  He found, at para. 161, that this “evidence indicates … that Dr.
    Hibberd may have some future problems in relation to her wrist injury, which
    may in turn impact on her practice and ability to earn income”.  And, at para. 162 he went on to observe that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The courts have noted that the task of determining
    whether the plaintiff will suffer future pecuniary loss and if so, the amount
    of such loss, is, by its very nature, a speculative exercise.  To be entitled to such compensation, a
    plaintiff must establish on the evidence that there is a “real and substantial
    risk” that future pecuniary loss will occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s analysis of the evidence led him to
    conclude that the possible complications for Dr. Hibberd in the future are
    carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, the rupture of her ECRL tendon and
    osteoarthritis.  Because of this he held
    that it was “necessary to determine whether there is a “real and substantial
    risk” that Dr Hibberd will suffer pecuniary loss from some or all of the
    possible future complications and, if so, the amount of such loss”.  Clearly, he was aware of the test and its
    application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%;'>The trial judge then reviewed the evidence
    with respect to each possible complication in turn.  With respect to carpal tunnel syndrome, the
    trial judge found that there was no evidence to establish a real and substantial
    risk.  Although he found that Dr. Hibberd
    had suffered and would continue to suffer from tendonitis, he concluded – based
    on his earlier findings with respect to Dr. Hibberd’s ability to accommodate
    her practice to her injuries - that this would not prevent her from working or
    even reduce the amount of work she could perform.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%;'>Similarly, after a thorough review of the
    evidence, the trial judge found that there was a real and substantial risk that
    Dr. Hibberd would develop osteoarthritis in her left wrist as a result of her
    injury.  However, he held that there was
    no evidence as to how this would impact on her practice.  Although the trial judge does mention the
    possibility of the arthritis developing after Dr. Hibberd reaches the age of
    60, I read this as simply part of his overall analysis, which sought to
    demonstrate the lack of evidence establishing when or how arthritis could
    develop and what effect it would have on Dr. Hibberd’s practice.  He went on to hold that making any assessment
    of pecuniary loss was therefore purely speculative and refused to award damages
    with respect to this contingency.  In my
    view, he was not in error in doing so because purely speculative claims will
    not give rise to compensation: see </span><i>Athey v. Leonati</i>, [1996] 3
    S.C.R. 458, at para. 27.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the
    trial judge did find that the evidence established the possibility that
    because of her wrist injury, Dr. Hibberd could rupture her left ECRL tendon at
    some point in the future.  Further,
    having regard to the evidence in respect of both the treatment and prognosis if
    the ECRL tendon does rupture at some point in the future, it was the view of
    the trial judge that there is a real and substantial risk that she would suffer
    some amount of pecuniary loss as a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then went on to determine the amount of
    pecuniary loss which Dr. Hibberd might suffer.  In doing so he held that it was necessary to assess the degree of risk
    to Dr. Hibberd, including an assessment of both the general and specific
    contingencies which apply.  This was the
    correct approach: see <i>Graham v. Rourke </i><span style='line-height:200%;'>(1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 622
    (Ont. C.A.) </span>at paras. 42 to 47.  And, finally at para. 189, after a full analysis, the trial judge
    concluded that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Considering the above noted contingencies, and in
    particular the issue of whether a rupture will occur at all, it is my view that
    the proper assessment of Dr. Hibberd’s future pecuniary loss resulting from a
    potential rupture of her ECRL tendon is $100,000</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the trial judge based this award on his findings
    regarding the severity and likelihood of the risks that would materialize.  In doing so, he addressed each risk proposed
    by the plaintiff in turn, analyzing the possibility that the condition would
    materialize and its likely effect on Dr. Hubberd’s revenue.  In my view, he properly considered whether
    her wrist injury gave rise to a “real and substantial risk” of future income
    loss.  I would reject this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of the above reasons, I would dismiss the
    appeal.  I would award the respondents
    their costs of the appeal in the aggregate amount of $20,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.</p>
