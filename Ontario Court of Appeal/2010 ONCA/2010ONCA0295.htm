style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each of the parties has filed a separate motion
    to this court.  Both were heard
    together.  Some brief background will be
    beneficial to understanding the nature of both motions, and my disposition of
    them.</p>
  <h2>BRIEF BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Gilbert and Ms. Warren met in 1994; they
    decided in March of 1996 that they would live together; and, in April 1996, the
    disputed property (the “farm property”) was purchased.  The farm property was purchased for $125,000,
    with a $10,000 deposit, and financed by a first and second mortgage.  Apparently it now has a value of
    approximately $1,500,000 to $2,000,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the time the farm property was purchased,
    title to it was in the name of Mr. Gilbert and his aunt, Elizabeth Gilbert, as
    joint tenants.&nbsp; Elizabeth Gilbert died in July of 2005.&nbsp; As a result
    of her death, Mr. Gilbert held the legal title to the property in his name
    alone.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 5, 2003, Mr. Gilbert was arrested
    and charged with assaulting Ms. Warren. Ms. Warren and her son and the parties’
    daughter remained on the farm property until November 2003, at which time they
    vacated pursuant to a court order.&nbsp; Mr. Gilbert then went into possession
    and continues to reside on the farm property. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also in February 2003, Ms. Warren commenced
    proceedings in which she claimed a beneficial interest in the property.  This was vigorously opposed by Mr.
    Gilbert.  After a lengthy trial that
    occupied days in October 2005 and February and March 2006, MacDougall J. – in
    reasons released May 19, 2006 – found that Ms. Warren holds a one-half interest
    in the property by way of resulting trust and constructive trust. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Gilbert appealed MacDougall J’s decision
    which, on December 18, 2006, this court dismissed in its entirety, with costs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not satisfied, the Estate of Elizabeth Gilbert
    moved to set aside the judgment of MacDougall J.  On July 18, 2007 the motion was dismissed,
    and the appeal of that decision to this court was dismissed on October 10,
    2008.  There are two more proceedings in
    this matter, which seems to bring us to these motions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, in his decision of May 19, 2006,
    MacDougall J. provided that an accounting hearing was to take place to settle
    matters such as income, expenditures and liabilities as between Mr. Gilbert and
    Ms. Warren.  That hearing took place on
    July 21, 2009 and MacDougall J’s decision was released on August 21, 2009 (the
    “accounting decision”).  Second,
    MacDougall J. rendered a decision on costs dated August 21, 2009 (the “costs
    decision”).  I am told that it is Mr.
    Gilbert’s intention to appeal both of those decisions to this court. </p>
  <h2>THE MOTIONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>David Gilbert’s motion (M38594) – as argued by
    his counsel – is said to involve two discrete matters.  First, he seeks to re-open the appeal
    decision of this court dated December 18, 2006.  Second, he requests directions in connection with his intended appeal of
    the “accounting” and “costs” decisions of MacDougal J referred to above.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kellie Warren’s motion (M38717) also seeks
    different forms of relief.  First, she <span
style='line-height:200%'>asks this court to dismiss
    Mr. Gilbert’s motion.  Second, she
    requests an order requiring Mr. Gilbert to immediately pay the costs of prior
    proceedings that remain outstanding.  Third,
    she requests an order that no further proceedings be instituted by Mr. Gilbert
    without leave of this Court.  And,
    finally, she seeks an order for security for costs.</span></p>
  <h2><i>David Gilbert’s motion</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although he frames his motion as a request to
    re-open the appeal decided by this court on December 18, 2006, what he really
    seeks to do is to amend, set aside or vary the May 19, 2006 judgment of
    MacDougall J. on the basis of newly discovered documents.  To obtain this relief he must make a motion
    to the Superior Court of Justice pursuant to r.&nbsp;59.06(2).  This court has no jurisdiction to grant such
    relief: <i>Aristocrat v. Aristocrat</i> (2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 275 (CA). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This court confirmed in <i>Aristocrat </i>that even where a judgment of the Superior Court of Justice has been
    affirmed on appeal, the proper venue for <span class=GramE>a</span> r. 59.06(2)
    motion is the Superior Court of Justice.  As that court is the proper venue for the hearing of the motion, it is
    also the proper venue for any request for directions concerning the motion.  Moreover, issues arising out of newly
    discovered documents should also be submitted to the Superior Court of Justice
    pursuant to <span class=GramE>a</span> r. 59.06(2) motion.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Regarding the intention to appeal the costs and accounting
    decisions of MacDougall J.; they are separate from the original judgment.  Each appeal has its own record and the
    contents of the record are determined with reference to the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>and Practice
    Guidelines.  And, as I understand the
    oral submissions, it is in connection with this intended appeal that Mr.
    Gilbert seeks directions.  In this
    regard, he poses a series of question in his Notice of Motion, which I will
    comment on very briefly:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Directions are not necessary as to the
    constitution of the court for the purposes of the intended appeal.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court cannot give directions on matters such
    as what materials are necessary for the resolution of the questions under
    appeal.  Those are matters for counsel to
    decide when the grounds of appeal are known.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It will be necessary to file the documents and
    evidence for the accounting hearings by the parties other than their own
    affidavits.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would conclude this part of my analysis with
    this observation.  A motion for
    directions is not, nor should it be, a substitute for counsel researching legal
    questions.  It seems to me that counsel
    should have been able to answer the questions posed without recourse to this
    court.</p>
  <h2><i>Kellie Warren’s motion</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, with respect to Ms. Warren’s request for
    an order that no further proceedings may be instituted without leave of this
    court; that request must be made by application to the Superior Court of
    Justice: see <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    s. 140(1).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, Ms. Warren seeks an order requiring Mr. Gilbert to
    immediately pay the costs of prior proceedings.  Given the history of this matter, I am inclined to grant this
    relief.  The record demonstrates that the
    present motion is part of an ongoing and continuous campaign to simply delay
    payment of previous judgments.  I note
    that in her book of authorities, Ms. Warren lists 12 separate decisions in this
    dispute, two of which were from this court.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For these reasons, pursuant to r. 56.01(c), I make such an
    order.   Mr. Gilbert should not be
    permitted to proceed with any further appeals until the previous costs awards
    are paid, or unless this court otherwise orders.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, Ms. Warren’s requests related to security for costs,
    in my view, should be made when and if the intention of Mr. Gilbert to file
    another appeal actually materializes.   </span></p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even though I did briefly respond to the questions
    posed in Mr. Gilbert’s Notice of Motion, I also observed that it was wholly
    unnecessary to have asked them.  I view
    this as amounting to a dismissal of his motion.  That coupled with Ms. Warren’s success in obtaining an order pursuant to
    r. 56.01(c), entitles her to her costs of these motions.  Accordingly, I award her such costs in the
    aggregate amount of $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
