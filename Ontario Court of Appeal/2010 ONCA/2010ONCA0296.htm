  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After finding the respondent, Grant Sheng, guilty of sexual assault and
    sexual touching, the trial judge stayed the proceedings against him, holding
    that lost records had prejudiced his ability to make full answer and defence,
    and therefore deprived him of a fair trial.  This Crown appeal raises two main
    issues: first, whether the trial judge erred in granting a stay; and second, if
    he did, whether the appropriate remedy is to reinstate the guilty verdicts or
    order a new trial, or as the respondent contends, to stay further proceedings
    because of the Crown’s delay in perfecting its appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.H. and T.H. are sisters.  They allege that between 1988 and 1994, when
    they were between eight and 12 years old, the respondent, who was their
    mother’s boyfriend at the time, sexually abused them.  In 1994 the complainants
    disclosed the abuse to their mother and a teacher.  The police and the
    Children’s Aid Society (CAS) investigated the allegations.  No charges were
    laid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several months later, the complainants’ father reported the allegations
    to the police.  Again, the CAS and the police investigated.  Again, no charges
    were laid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over 10 years later, in the spring of 2005, the older complainant, J.H.,
    now an adult, met the respondent at a restaurant.  She surreptitiously taped
    their conversation in which she raised the alleged abuse.  J.H. then took the
    tape to the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This time the respondent was charged with two counts of sexual assault
    and two counts of sexual touching.  Critical to this appeal, in the period
    leading up to the charges, audio recordings and some notes of the
    investigations that took place in 1994 had been lost or destroyed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was tried before Hamilton J.  He did not testify and did
    not call a defence.  In December 2006, the trial judge delivered lengthy
    reasons for judgment in which he found the respondent guilty of all charges. 
    However, one month later, the trial judge stayed the proceedings.  He concluded
    that the respondent “was prejudiced by the loss of the evidence and was
    prevented from making full answer and defence”, and that “[t]here is no way of
    redressing the infringement of the accused’s right other than ordering a stay
    of the proceedings.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its appeal, the Crown makes three submissions.  First, it submits
    that the trial judge erred by finding that the audiotapes had been lost because
    of the Crown’s unacceptable negligence.  Second, it submits that the trial
    judge erred by finding that the respondent was materially prejudiced by the
    lost records.  Third, it submits that the trial judge erred by finding that this
    was one of those rare cases warranting a stay.  The Crown asks to set aside the
    stay and reinstate the guilty verdicts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent asks that the appeal be dismissed.  Alternatively, the
    respondent asks to stay any further proceedings against him on the ground that
    the Crown took an unacceptably long time – 18 months beyond the date provided
    for in our <i>Criminal Appeal Rules</i> – to perfect its appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Crown that the trial
    judge erred in granting a stay.  And I do not agree with the respondent that a
    dismissal of the appeal or a further stay is warranted because of the delay in
    perfecting the appeal.  However, in my view, the appropriate and fair remedy is
    not to reinstate the guilty verdicts but to order a new trial.  Although the
    trial judge was correct to assess the merits of the case before considering the
    stay application, his decisions were then out of sequence.  Having concluded
    that the respondent was materially prejudiced in his defence by the lost records,
    the trial judge should not have made findings of guilt; he should simply have
    granted a stay.  As I would set aside the stay, I would order a new trial.</p>

    parents, Joseph H. and Wendy T.  The parents separated in 1989.  The two
    sisters lived with their mother, first in a one bedroom apartment and then in a
    townhouse.  After the separation, Ms. T. and the respondent developed “a more
    personal relationship”.  Although the respondent had his own home, he stayed
    overnight with Ms. T. and the children approximately twice a week.</span></p>

    preliminary inquiry evidence, about one incident of digital penetration, and
    about one incident when the respondent put his penis on her mouth.</span></p>

    turned on credibility, they likely would have been useful for cross-examining
    the complainants.  Therefore, if they were in the Crown’s possession or control
    at the time of trial, the Crown would have had a duty to produce them under the
    disclosure standards in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.</span></p>

    includes the obligation to preserve relevant evidence.  However, as Sopinka J.
    noted in his majority judgment in <i>R. v. La</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680,
    “despite the best efforts of the Crown to preserve evidence, owing to the
    frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost.”  The loss or
    destruction of relevant evidence that was once in the Crown’s possession or
    control thus does not automatically equate to a breach of the Crown’s
    disclosure obligation.  In <i>La</i>, Sopinka J. sets out the legal framework
    for analyzing when lost or destroyed evidence gives rise to a breach of s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i> and when it justifies a stay of proceedings.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The starting point is the Crown’s obligation to
    explain why the evidence was lost.  That obligation flows from the Crown’s duty

    explanation at all, and cases where the Crown’s explanation is satisfactory.  </span></p>

    the Crown’s explanation shows that the evidence has been lost or destroyed
    because of the Crown’s “unacceptable negligence”, then the Crown has failed to
    meet its disclosure obligation.  It has breached s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>. 
    Whether the breach entitles the accused to a stay of proceedings or some lesser
    remedy depends on the extent of the actual prejudice caused by the loss or
    destruction of the evidence.  </span></p>

    or destruction of the evidence, it has met its disclosure obligation.  Section
    7 of the <i>Charter</i> has not been breached.  Still, “in extraordinary
    circumstances” the accused may be entitled to a stay if the accused can show
    that the lost or destroyed evidence is “so prejudicial to the right to make

    found that “there was negligent handling of the audiotapes”, though no

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>P.C. Brinn also testified under

    erred in this finding.  At para. 21 of <i>La</i>, Sopinka J. discussed the
    considerations bearing on whether the Crown has satisfactorily explained the
    loss or destruction of evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In order to determine whether the
    explanation of the Crown is satisfactory, the Court should analyse the
    circumstances surrounding the loss of the evidence.  The main consideration is
    whether the Crown or the police (as the case may be) took reasonable steps in
    the circumstances to preserve the evidence for disclosure.  One circumstance
    that must be considered is the relevance that the evidence was perceived to
    have at the time.  The police cannot be expected to preserve everything that
    comes into their hands on the off-chance that it will be relevant in the
    future.  In addition, even the loss of relevant evidence will not result in a
    breach of the duty to disclose if the conduct of the police is reasonable.  But
    as the relevance of the evidence increases, so does the degree of care for its
    preservation that is expected of the police.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the Crown explained that in
    accordance with its practice at the time the audiotapes were stored in a locked
    drawer in a filing cabinet.  I do not find this practice to be unacceptably
    negligent.  It does not differ in substance from the practice of storing officers’
    notebooks in the police division’s basement, which the trial judge found not to
    be unacceptably negligent – a finding I accept.  Indeed, the trial judge offered
    no reason for the distinction he drew, and I see no basis for that
    distinction.  </span></p>

    concluded that the respondent would not be charged.  There was no prospect that
    the investigation would be reopened years later.  It is a fair inference that
    the officers reasonably thought that the audiotapes would not be needed in the
    future.  To repeat what Sopinka J. said in La, “[t]he police cannot be expected
    to preserve everything that comes into their hands on the off-chance that it
    will be relevant in the future.”</span></p>

    respondent was not entitled to a stay merely because he was deprived of
    relevant evidence.  To justify a stay the respondent had to show that the lost
    evidence prejudiced him in a substantial or material way.  The trial judge concluded
    that the lost evidence would assist the respondent in a material way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There is an air of reality to the

    because, in reaching that conclusion, he does not address the impact of the
    lost evidence in the light of other evidence available to the defence to
    challenge the credibility of J.H. and T.H..  In <i>La</i>, Sopinka J. wrote

    interview and of her interview of J.H., were produced.  Moreover, there is no firm
    evidence that either interview was audiotaped.  Even if the interviews were
    audiotaped and the audiotapes were later lost or erased, Ms. Pasquill’s notes

    report summarized the entire investigation he and Officer Brinn conducted,
    included “pertinent” and “salient features” of what was said, and even referred
    to other information the CAS had collected.  Again, this report went some

    what they said to the CAS and the police during the 1994 investigations, at
    best the lost evidence from those investigations would have permitted the
    defence to bring out a few more lies and a few more inconsistencies in the

    parties have conflicting positions on the appropriate remedy.  The respondent
    says that we should still dismiss the appeal, or reinstate a stay because of
    the Crown’s delay in perfecting the appeal.  The Crown says that we should
    reinstate the guilty verdicts and remit the case to the trial court for
    sentencing.  I would not adopt either party’s position.  Instead, I would order
    a new trial.</span></p>

    the Crown’s appeal ought to have been perfected on December 11, 2007.  It was
    perfected on June 16, 2009.  The delay beyond the perfection date was 18
    months.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The reason for the delay was the ongoing ill-health
    of Crown counsel who had carriage of the appeal.  This explains why the delay
    occurred, and the circumstances giving rise to it are surely sympathetic.  But,
    as the Crown fairly acknowledges, however sympathetic the circumstances, they
    do not excuse the delay.  The Crown accepts its institutional responsibility to
    ensure the timely perfection of its appeals.  This appeal could have, and
    undoubtedly should have, been assigned to another counsel.  Because of the 18
    month delay, the respondent submits that this court should dismiss the appeal. 
    As I would set aside the stay, I do not think a dismissal is an available
    remedy under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>

    further proceedings.  He filed an affidavit to demonstrate that he has been
    diagnosed as having moderate to severe clinical depression.  He says that the

    life.  </span></p>

    that continuing the proceedings would amount to an abuse of process.  A stay
    for abuse of process is limited to cases where prosecutorial conduct is so
    unfair or vexatious or oppressive that continuing the proceedings would offend
    our sense of justice and undermine the integrity of the judicial process: see <i>R.

    appeal for any oblique or nefarious motive.  The delay was entirely due to
    counsel’s ill health.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Twice during the 18 month period, Crown counsel
    telephoned counsel for the respondent to explain the delay in perfecting the
    appeal.  Both times counsel for the respondent said that he was “in no rush”
    and “health comes first”.  These were gracious replies, reflecting the courtesy
    and civility that generally exists between Crown and defence counsel appearing
    in this court.  Perhaps for that reason they should not weigh strongly against
    the respondent’s request for a stay.  However, coming from senior and
    responsible counsel, they do suggest that continuing the proceedings would not
    be oppressive to the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

    the <i>Criminal Appeal Rules</i> to ensure that the appeal was perfected long
    before it was.  For example, after the perfection date had passed, the
    respondent could have asked that the appeal be placed on this court’s “purge
    list”.  Then a judge of this court would have imposed strict time limits for
    perfection, and if they were not met, the appeal could have been dismissed as
    abandoned.  </span></p>

    pre-date the appeal, and even the trial.  Thus, the most that can be said is
    that the delay extended the period of uncertainty.  However, if the respondent
    is retried and convicted, the trial judge can assess whether the Crown’s delay
    would warrant a reduction of the respondent’s sentence: see <i>R. v. Williams</i> (2009), 95 O.R. (3d) 660 (C.A.).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons I would not further stay the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the respondent guilty and
    then he stayed the proceedings because of the lost evidence.  The Crown submits
    that if we set aside the stay, we should simply reinstate the trial judge’s
    findings of guilt, enter convictions and remit the matter to the trial court
    for sentencing.  That remedy is superficially attractive because by setting
    aside the stay we would have concluded that the lost evidence did not
    materially prejudice the respondent’s ability to make full answer and defence. 
    However, I do not consider reinstating the guilty verdicts to be a fair or
    proper remedy for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first reason is that the lost evidence,
    though not sufficiently prejudicial to justify a stay, may have warranted a
    lesser remedy, or at least could have been factored into the assessment of the
    credibility and reliability of the complainants’ evidence.  In an appropriate
    case, the lost evidence could give rise to a reasonable doubt about an
    accused’s guilt.  The trial judge in this case considered the lost evidence so
    prejudicial that it warranted a stay, yet he never considered the impact of the
    lost evidence when he assessed the complainants’ testimony.  As he stayed
    proceedings, one must assume that had he turned his mind to the matter he would
    have taken the lost evidence into account when deciding on the accused’s
    guilt.  Yet, he does not mention the lost evidence in his reasons for
    conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second and main reason why I would not
    reinstate the guilty verdicts is that those guilty verdicts and the later stay
    are irreconcilable.  The guilty verdicts assume guilt after a fair trial; the
    stay assumes that because the lost evidence was so prejudicial the respondent
    did not receive a fair trial.  The two cannot stand together.  What then should
    the trial judge have done?  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not err by waiting until the
    end of the trial to assess whether the prejudicial impact of the evidence
    justified a stay: see <i>La</i> at para. 27.  The degree of prejudice
    ordinarily is best assessed after all the evidence is in.  Moreover, before
    deciding on the stay the trial judge properly addressed the merits.  That was
    the proper approach because if, on the evidence led, the Crown had not proved
    the case against the respondent, then he was entitled to an acquittal and not
    just a stay: see <i>R. v. Scott</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, once the trial judge determined that
    the respondent was not entitled to an acquittal, he should then have considered
    whether the lost evidence compromised the fairness of the trial.  If he
    concluded that the lost evidence was so prejudicial to the accused’s defence
    that it warranted a stay, he should have stayed the proceedings, and not made
    any findings of guilt.  If he concluded that the lost evidence warranted a
    lesser remedy, he should have given effect to that remedy before considering
    whether the accused was guilty.  If he considered that the lost evidence should
    be factored into the assessment of the credibility and reliability of the
    complainants’ testimony, he should have performed that assessment in deciding
    whether the accused was guilty.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The procedure the trial judge followed parallels
    the accepted procedure when entrapment is raised by the defence and, in
    fairness to the trial judge, the procedure suggested in some of the cases
    dealing with lost evidence.  An application for a stay because of lost evidence
    and an application for a stay because of entrapment bear some similarities.  But
    I see the two differently.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When entrapment is claimed, the trial judge
    first determines guilt or innocence; if the trial judge finds the accused
    guilty then the trial judge goes on to consider whether to stay the proceedings
    because of entrapment.  This two-stage process where guilt is determined first
    is appropriate because a claim of entrapment has nothing to do with the
    fairness of the trial, or the culpability of the accused.  It has to do with
    whether it was fair to even have a trial: see <i>R. v. Imoro</i> (2010), 251
    C.C.C. (3d) 131 (Ont. C.A.).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The two-stage process for entrapment is not
    appropriate when a stay is sought because evidence has been lost or destroyed. 
    Lost evidence potentially compromises the fairness of the trial itself.  A stay
    because of lost evidence is granted where the missing evidence is so
    prejudicial that the accused cannot receive a fair trial.  Thus, if the trial
    judge decides not to acquit, the trial judge should then rule on the stay
    application.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If we were to reinstate the guilty verdicts, we
    would be permitting the Crown to take advantage of the procedure adopted by the
    trial judge.  Doing so offends my sense of fairness.  If the trial judge had
    followed the procedure I have outlined, he would have granted a stay and made
    no findings of guilt.  Having allowed the Crown’s appeal and set aside the
    stay, we would simply have ordered a new trial.</span></p>
