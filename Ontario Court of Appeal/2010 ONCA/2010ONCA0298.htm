  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions of three counts
    of sexual assault and one count of sexual touching. He also appeals his sentence
    of 15 months in the reformatory and 2 years probation. There are three grounds
    of appeal against conviction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in respect of the count involving K.K., the
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his conclusion that the massage
    the appellant had the complainant perform on his upper leg area near the groin
    was for a sexual purpose. We reject this submission. The trial judge gave full
    reasons for his conclusion and took into account all of the evidence before
    him. He made no error in so doing. The evidence was more than sufficient to
    satisfy the objective test set out in the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <i>R. v. Chase</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293 at
    para. 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground relates to the counts involving B.D.
    The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by concluding without direct
    evidence that the appellant would have had access to the Yonge Street house
    once he moved from there and his daughter began to live there. In our view, the
    trial judge made no error in drawing that inference, taking into account B.D.’s
    evidence about her memory of being in the Yonge Street house several times
    including in the locked bedroom. There was also evidence that the appellant
    continued to refer to the Yonge Street address as his own for some purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred
    by looking for reasons to reject the appellant’s evidence. In our view, the
    trial judge’s reasons were thorough and comprehensive. He properly referred to
    reasons for his conclusions on credibility and for rejecting the evidence of
    the appellant. We see no error in his conclusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third ground raised is that the trial judge erred
    by failing to find that the test of threshold relevance had been met in respect
    of the counselling records that were sought to be admitted by the appellant. In
    particular, he asserts that B.D.’s credibility was challenged because she
    testified that the allegations against the appellant were not discussed in
    counselling while there was an affidavit from a lawyer at Children’s Aid that
    referred to a phone call from a counsellor regarding the first counselling
    session and the reason for it that contradicted B.D.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject this submission for three reasons. First, as
    acknowledged by counsel on the appeal, this argument was not made by counsel at
    trial. Second, the argument could not have been properly made at trial because
    the note of the telephone conversation was inadmissible for that purpose. The
    content of any counselling records cannot be disclosed without a court order. Third,
    the trial judge gave careful and full reasons as well as case authority for his
    decision not to review the records. We see no error in his approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in imposing a 15-month custodial sentence in part for specific deterrence
    when he had already said in the context of rejecting a conditional sentence
    that the appellant would not be a danger in the community. We do not agree that
    this reflects an inconsistency in reasoning. Specific deterrence is generally a
    factor in sentencing in most cases. In any event, in our view, the sentence
    imposed was at the low end of the range given the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
