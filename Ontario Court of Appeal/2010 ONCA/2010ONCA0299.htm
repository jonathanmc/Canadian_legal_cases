style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For reasons released January 27, 2010, the
    appeal was allowed and the trial judgment set aside.  It had been agreed between <span class=GramE>counsel</span> at the conclusion of argument that the appellant’s trial costs, in the event
    the appeal was successful, would be fixed by this court following the release
    of this court’s decision at which point counsel were to file their submissions
    made to the trial court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge awarded no costs essentially
    because in his view the plaintiffs could have had, without a trial, what they
    were granted after trial by accepting the offer of the defendants and as he
    stated in his reasons “In my view there was no winner.  Success was equally divided.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants seek partial indemnity costs to
    the date of their offer to settle and substantial indemnity costs thereafter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I begin with the well-settled proposition that a
    successful party is entitled to its costs.  Here the appellants, who were defendants at trial, have been entirely
    successful and are therefore entitled, at a minimum, to their partial indemnity
    costs throughout.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the <span class=GramE>appellants,</span> served a Rule 49 offer and their ultimate success in having the respondents’
    action entirely dismissed is a result that is much better than their offer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rule 49.10 does not address a situation where an
    offer is served by a defendant and the plaintiff recovers nothing.  This court has held that the rule has no
    application in cases where the plaintiff fails to recover judgment.  See <i>Scapillati
    v. A. Potuin Construction Ltd.</i> (1999), 175 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 169
    (C.A.); <i>S. &amp; A. Strasser Ltd. v.
    Richmond Hill (Town)</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 243 (C.A.).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, rule 49.13 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that despite rule 49.10 the
    court in exercising its discretion with respect to costs, may take into account
    any offer to settle made in writing, the date the offer was made and the terms
    of the offer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of course the overall discretion of the court
    toward costs in civil proceedings is set out in s. 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> and in rule 57.01.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court has recently considered the interplay
    of s. 131 of <i>The Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    rule 49.10 and rule 49.13.  In <i>Davies v. Clarington (Municipality)</i> (2009), 312 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 278 at para. 40, Epstein J.A. writing for
    this court stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In summary while fixing costs is a discretionary
    exercise, attracting a high level of deference, it must be on a principled
    basis.  The judicial discretion under
    rules 49.13 and 57.01 is not so broad as to permit a fundamental change to the
    law that governs the award of an elevated level of costs.  Apart from the operation of rule 49.10,
    elevated costs should <i>only</i> be awarded
    on a clear finding of reprehensible conduct on the part of the party against
    which the cost award is being made.  As
    Austin J.A. established in <i>Scapillati</i>,<i> Strasser </i>should be interpreted to fit
    within this framework – as a case where the trial judge implicitly found such
    egregious behaviour, deserving of sanction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view the trial judge in denying costs to
    the respondents who had been successful at trial, considered their conduct
    deserving of chastisement.  He considered
    the plaintiffs to have wasted time refusing to consent to amendments to the
    defendants’ pleadings that should have been accepted and failing to narrow the
    issues by admitting what was obvious.  Further, there was evidence at trial of misconduct on the part of the
    plaintiffs in their use, or more properly misuse, of the defendants’
    property.   Indeed the conduct of one of
    the Schwark children was so egregious that his parents banned him from coming
    to the cottage for one year.  All this in
    the face of a most reasonable offer by the defendants that would have permitted
    the plaintiffs continued use of the beach front property.  In my view, in all of the circumstances, an
    award of costs on a substantial indemnity basis from the date of the offer to
    settle and on a partial indemnity basis prior to the date of that offer is
    warranted.</p>
  <h4>Reasonableness of Claim</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants seek their trial costs on this
    basis (i.e., partial indemnity to the date of the offer to settle and
    substantial indemnity thereafter) in the total sum of $80,755.19 inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents, who also made a Rule 49 offer,
    submitted Bills of Costs to the trial judge wherein they claimed:</p>
