  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 23, 2008, the appellant was found not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD) on charges of
    assault (x2) and threatening death or bodily harm (x3).  <span style='line-height:200%'>On June 3, 2008, the Board released its initial disposition,
    ordering that the appellant be detained at the minimum secure unit of CAMH
    subject to various conditions.  The
    appellant appeals from a subsequent disposition of the Ontario Review Board,
    dated June 4, 2009, whereby his continued detention was ordered.    </span></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the Board’s decision failed
    to reflect the least onerous and least restrictive disposition and that the
    Board erred in law by failing to meaningfully consider whether the appellant
    could be discharged absolutely or conditionally.  The other issues raised in the appellant’s factum
    were not pursued on appeal and I would not give effect to them.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the intervening year following the appellant’s
    detention, he made great progress such that, although detained, he is out in
    the community every day and enjoys very liberal privileges.  He works, drives a car and plays golf.  In addition, he has participated meaningfully
    in various psycho-educational programs and enjoyed supervised access to his
    daughter.  <span style='line-height:200%;'>There has been no issue with
    the appellant’s compliance with medication for his delusional disorder since he
    came under the jurisdiction of the Board (except for refusing to take
    medication that caused him serious side effects).  </span>The hospital’s plan is to continue his
    detention but to allow him to live in the community in a two-bedroom apartment
    that the appellant found for himself.  He
    would have a general practitioner to attend to his medical needs in the
    community.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although not
    referred to in its reasons for disposition, the Board had evidence in the
    expert opinion of Dr. Pearce that approved accommodation was an important risk
    management tool.  This court has held
    that in such circumstances, the continued detention of the patient should be
    ordered.  See <i>Brockville Psychiatric Hospital v. <span class=SpellE>McGillis</span></i>,<i> </i>[1996] O.J. No. 3430 at para. 4 and <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Capano</span></i>,<i> </i>[2008] O.J. No. 1712 at para. 8.  Here, the submission of <i>amicus</i> was that approval of the appellant’s accommodation was
    imminent and more in the nature of a formality and the appeal proceeded on that
    basis.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s findings disclose essentially two reasons
    for its disposition. First, the Board was concerned that if discharged into the
    community, albeit on a conditional basis, the appellant would not continue to
    take his medication. If he ceased taking his medication, the appellant could
    start to decompensate, he would not be immediately certifiable, and the
    hospital would have no ability to return him.  The Board was concerned that the appellant would
    constitute a real risk of physical or psychological harm to the safety of the
    public before he could be returned to detention.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The second
    reason the Board gave for the appellant’s continued detention is that he would
    face a number of stressors in the community, including returning to a teaching
    position, court proceedings in an attempt to have joint custody of his daughter
    and interpersonal relationships.  The
    Board noted that in the past, interpersonal conflict with others had affected
    the appellant’s mental status and led to delusions.  Moreover, at the hearing Dr. Pearce testified
    that stressors involved in teaching and living independently could cause <span
class=GramE>a deterioration</span> in the appellant’s mental condition even
    independent of compliance with medication. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Board’s <span
class=GramE>conclusion, that</span> continued detention of the appellant was necessary
    to ensure timely intervention if the appellant <span class=SpellE>decompensated</span>,
    was in accord with the evidence and opinion of the appellant’s psychiatrist,
    Dr. Pearce.  However, his evidence
    appears to have been premised on the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i> and did not take into consideration the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code. </i></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The able
    submissions of the <i>amicus</i> are that
    the Board’s decision is not consistent with <i>R.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Breitwieser</span></i>,<i> </i>[2009] O.J. No. 4653.  In
    that case, this court held that where there is an air of reality to the claim
    that a conditional discharge would be an appropriate disposition, the Board
    must address two elements.  As stated at
    para. 18 of the court’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, the Board must canvass whether the accused
    will consent to appropriate conditions under s. 672.55 [of the <i>Criminal Code</i>].  Second, it must address the potential
    mechanisms for the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> return to the hospital
    in the event of non-compliance, and determine whether the patient is likely to
    agree to return or whether a combination of s. 672.55 [consent to condition
    regarding psychiatric treatment] and either s. 672.92 or s. 672.93(2) or
    another route of return would be sufficient in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber><span style='line-height:200%;text-transform:uppercase;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 672.92 allows a peace officer to arrest
    a person subject to a conditional discharge if, pursuant to s. 672.91, the
    officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has contravened or
    wilfully failed to comply with a condition in a disposition order or is about
    to do so.  If, taking into consideration
    the conditions of the conditional discharge, the need to prevent the commission
    of an offence or to prevent the person from contravening a condition of his or her
    discharge, a peace officer has a reasonable belief that the person’s detention
    is necessary in the public <span class=GramE>interest,</span> the peace officer
    cannot release that person.  Instead, the
    peace officer must take the person before a justice of the peace within
    twenty-four hours after arrest.  Pursuant
    to s. 672.93, if the justice of the peace is satisfied that the accused person
    has failed to comply with a disposition, the justice of the peace may make an
    order that the accused be returned to a place that is specified in the
    disposition order.<u></u></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the Board did not engage in a consideration of
    the two elements it was required to address.  The evidentiary threshold, an air of reality,
    existed for the Board to explore the appellant’s willingness to consent to a
    medication regime that would potentially satisfy any concerns the Board had
    about public safety.  The Board also
    failed to turn its mind to the practical reality that in the event the
    appellant failed to follow the conditions of a conditional discharge, he could
    be detained quickly for breaching his conditions.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That said, the evidence that the appellant does
    not believe he has a major mental illness, his limited insight into his
    illness, non-compliance with treatment while living in the community in 2007, requests
    for discontinuance or reduction of his medication, and difficulty accepting
    that he requires life-long treatment, cannot be ignored. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>At the time of the hearing before
    the Board, the appellant had no history of self-medication, let alone a
    successful regime of compliance within the community.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Board’s determination that the appellant was a
    significant threat to public safety was not based on a mere speculative
    assumption that he would not take his medication if granted a conditional
    discharge.  Furthermore, the submissions
    of <i>amicus</i> do not address the second
    reason for the Board’s refusal to grant a discharge, including a conditional
    discharge, namely, the stressors in the appellant’s life.  The appellant could not be arrested should
    his mental status decompensate due to these stressors despite compliance with
    medication as he would not be in breach of any term of his disposition. In all
    the circumstances, the Board’s decision was not unreasonable.  </span></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
