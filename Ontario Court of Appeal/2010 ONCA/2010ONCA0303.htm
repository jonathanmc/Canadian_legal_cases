style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The respondent, Znamensky Selekcionno-Gibridny Center LLC,
    brought an application pursuant to the Act in which it sought to have two
    Russian arbitral awards recognized and enforced.  The arbitral awards, made by the
    International Commercial Arbitration Court at the Chamber of Commerce and
    Industry of the Russian Federation (the “ICAC”), were in favour of the
    respondent and against the appellant, Donaldson International Livestock Ltd.  They give the respondent damages arising from
    a contract in which the appellant was to supply pigs to the respondent in
    Russia.  The appellant did not participate
    in the arbitral proceedings.    </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant opposed enforcement on grounds set out in art.
    36(1) (a) (i), (ii) and (b).  It also
    moved for an order that the application proceed to trial or that it be granted
    leave to call witnesses at the hearing of the application.  Through the motion, the appellant sought to
    have the court deal with its allegation that the respondent’s principal had made
    death threats to the appellant’s principal.  The appellant said that its capacity to defend itself in the arbitral proceedings
    had been undermined because its witnesses were aware of the alleged death
    threats and refused to travel to Russia and participate in the proceedings because
    of them.  It argued that it would be
    contrary to public policy for the Ontario courts to enforce the awards without
    having the issue of the death threats resolved.  </span></p>

    judge placed heavy reliance on the first sentence in para. 28 of the Prior
    Appeal Decision (the “Sentence”).  The Sentence
    reads as follows: “In my view, the time to have requested the trial of the
    issue concerning the death threats was when the parties were before the motion
    judge.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Prior Appeal Decision arose from an appeal from the order
    of Gans J. dated November 27, 2007.  Justice Gans had been called on to decide a motion brought by the
    appellant for an anti-suit injunction prohibiting the respondent from
    proceeding with the arbitration before the ICAC.  In deciding the injunction motion, Gans J.
    considered an offer that the respondent had made in respect of the venue for
    the arbitration.  He found the offer to
    be a complete answer to the alleged death threats.  The application judge said that this finding
    by <span class=SpellE>Gans</span> J., by itself, was sufficient to dispose of
    the proceeding in favour of the respondent.      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>By judgment dated September 29, 2009 and November 13, 2009 (the
    “Judgment”), the application judge dismissed the appellant’s motion, granted
    the respondent’s application and ordered that the two arbitral awards be
    recognized and enforced.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>When read in context, the Sentence does not amount to a pronouncement
    by this court that the appellant had lost its opportunity to raise the issue of
    the alleged death threats because it failed to so in the proceeding before Gans
    J.  The Sentence was made in response to
    a request by the appellant that this court order a trial of the issue.  The court refused, explaining that it was not
    appropriate to grant the request because the appellant had not requested that
    relief in the proceedings before Gans J.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Paragraph 30 of the Prior Appeal Decision makes it clear that
    this court envisaged that the appellant would be free to raise the issue of
    death threats at any enforcement proceeding that the respondent might seek to
    bring.  The first sentence of para. 30 of
    the Prior Appeal Decision reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Should [the
    respondent] take steps to enforce its arbitral awards against [the appellant] in
    the Ontario courts, then it would seem to me that <i>[the appellant] should be free to resist the enforcement of those
    awards on whatever basis it chooses,</i> subject to the ruling of the presiding
    judge. [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Nor do we accept that issue estoppel flows from the statements
    made by Gans J. in the injunction motion.  Justice Gans’ observations on the issue of the alleged death threats were
    made in the context of an interim interlocutory proceeding seeking to prevent the
    ICAC arbitration from proceeding.  In our
    view, those remarks do not bind the judge deciding the enforcement
    proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In any event, it appears that Gans J.’s finding on this issue
    rests on a misapprehension of the evidence.  The respondent had not, as Gans J. appears to have understood, offered
    to change the venue of the arbitration hearing to a neutral location.  Rather, as the respondent confirmed to this
    court, the offer was to allow that part of the arbitration involving testimony
    by the appellant’s witnesses to be heard in a neutral location.  The balance of the arbitration would have
    taken place in Moscow.  Thus, the offer
    could not amount to a complete answer to the appellant’s concerns because the
    appellant would still have had to go to Russia for all aspects of the
    arbitration except for the giving of its testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The second error made in refusing to consider the appellant’s
    evidence of the alleged death threats is this.  Even if the preconditions to the operation of issue estoppel had been
    established, the court still had to determine whether, as a matter of
    discretion, issue estoppel ought to be applied: see <i>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at
    para. 33.  The application judge was
    obliged to take into account the entirety of the circumstances, including the
    factors for and against the exercise of this discretion, to determine whether
    the application of issue estoppel in this case would work an injustice:  <i>Danyluk </i>at paras. 66 and 80.  It was an error
    to fail to consider this residual discretion.  In the circumstances of this case – where the issue of the alleged death
    threats has never been decided on the merits and where that undecided issue
    goes to the heart of the appellant’s ability to participate in the arbitration
    – the application of issue estoppel would have worked an injustice. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In conclusion, the application judge erred in failing to
    consider the issue of the alleged death threats when deciding how to respond to
    the appellant’s motion and in dealing with the merits of the application to
    recognize and enforce the arbitral awards pursuant to Article 36(1) of the Act.  </span></p>
