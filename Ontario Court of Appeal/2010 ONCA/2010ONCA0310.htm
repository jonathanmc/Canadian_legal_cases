style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Toronto Catholic School Board (the “Board”) appeals from a
    judgment for damages arising from a failed real estate transaction.  The Board
    does not challenge the trial judge’s finding that it was in breach of its
    contractual obligation to use its best efforts to obtain the severance required
    to complete the sale.  However, the Board submits that the trial judge erred by
    finding that its breach caused the transaction to fail and by refusing to find
    that the respondent purchaser, Southcott Estates Inc. (“Southcott”), had failed
    to mitigate its damages.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (the
    “agreement”) with Southcott, pursuant to which the Board agreed to sell and
    Southcott agreed to purchase 4.78 acres of land in Toronto.  The land was part
    of a larger parcel used for school purposes by the Board, which had been declared
    surplus to the Board’s needs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Southcott is a single purpose company with no assets except the deposit
    it paid for the purchase.  Southcott is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ballantry
    Homes Inc., and part of a larger group of companies called Ballantry Group of
    Companies (“Ballantry”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Southcott sought to purchase the land for the purpose of a proposed
    residential development.  The agreement was conditional upon the Board
    obtaining a severance from the Committee of Adjustment on or before the closing
    date.  The agreement was signed on June 14, 2004, with an original closing date
    of August 31, 2004.  The agreement was conditional for a 30-day due diligence
    period during which Southcott could terminate the agreement at will.  The due
    diligence period was extended twice, and the agreement finally became firm on
    August 23, 2004.  As there was not enough time to obtain the severance and
    close by August 31, 2004, the closing date was extended.  The Board offered to
    extend the closing date to a fixed number of days after the severance was
    obtained, but Southcott insisted on an outside date for closing, namely January
    31, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board made a severance application to the Committee of Adjustments,
    which came to a hearing on December 16, 2004. The Board’s severance application
    was deferred at the municipality’s request as premature because it was not
    accompanied by a development plan.  This made it impossible to close the
    transaction by the closing date.  Southcott took the position that the Board
    had breached its obligation to use its best efforts to obtain the severance and
    that the Board was, therefore, not entitled to rely on the time of the essence
    clause.  The Board refused Southcott’s request to extend the closing date,
    declared the transaction to be at an end and returned Southcott’s deposit. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>TRIAL
    PROCEEDINGS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Southcott brought this action for specific performance and, in the
    alternative, damages.  The trial judge found that the Board had breached its
    obligation to use its best efforts to obtain the severance.  The trial judge
    found that the Board should have advised Southcott in a timely fashion that it
    was necessary to file a development plan to obtain the severance and that the
    Board should have done more by way of communicating with the planning authorities
    and the municipal counsellor.  The trial judge also found that but for these
    breaches, there was a 60% chance that the required severance would have been
    granted in time to permit closing on or before January 31, 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that as the land had been purchased for investment
    purposes, specific performance was not an available remedy.  With respect to
    damages, there was no increase in the value of the land between the date of the
    agreement and the date of breach and, accordingly, no award was made for loss
    of bargain.  The parties had agreed on the amount of profit Southcott would
    have made on the proposed residential development, had the transaction closed
    on January 31, 2005.  In that regard, the trial judge awarded Southcott damages
    for a 60% loss of the chance the transaction would have closed but for the
    breach which, when applied to the agreed amount for lost profits, resulted in
    an award of $1,935,500.  No issue is taken before us with the availability of
    “consequential” damages of this nature arising as a result of a failed real
    estate transaction, the quantification of the damages or the loss of chance. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this appeal, the Board does not challenge the trial judge’s finding
    that it breached its contractual duty to use its best efforts to obtain the
    severance required to close the transaction.  The Board argues, however, that
    the trial judge erred in two respects:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'>1.         By finding
    that the Board’s breach of duty was the cause of the failure to obtain the
    severance by the closing date; and </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'>2.         By failing to find that Southcott
    had not met its duty to mitigate damages.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>1. Causation</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The Board argues that, even if it had not breached
    its obligation in relation to the severance and done the things the trial judge
    said it should have done, there simply was insufficient time to obtain the
    severance by January 31, 2005.  It follows, the Board submits, that its breach
    cannot be said to have been the cause of the failure to complete the
    transaction by the specified closing date.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>When the Board was unable to obtain the severance
    by January 31, 2005, Southcott took the position that the closing date should
    be extended.  Although the Board had earlier proposed a flexible closing date
    to accommodate the need to obtain a severance, it now insisted upon strict
    adherence to the specified date of January 31, 2005.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I agree with Southcott’s submission that there is a
    fundamental and fatal legal flaw in the Board’s argument.  The Board’s
    causation argument rests upon the assumption that it was entitled to rely upon
    the time of the essence clause, and to impose the January 31, 2005 closing date
    as an inviolable outside limit for the closing of this transaction. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In my view, given the trial judge’s unchallenged
    finding that the Board was in breach, the Board was not entitled to rely on the
    time of the essence clause and terminate the agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a well-established principle of contract law that a party cannot
    use its own breach or default in satisfying a condition precedent as a basis
    for being relieved of its contractual obligations, while a party in breach of
    its obligation to do what is required to complete a transaction cannot
    terminate the agreement by relying on a time of the essence clause: see e.g.

    proposition: “It is a principle of law that no one can in such a case take
    advantage of the existence of a state of things which he himself produced.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this principle applies here to preclude the Board from
    relying on the time of the essence clause as a ground for escaping its
    contractual obligations, given the unchallenged finding that the Board was in
    breach of its obligation to use its best efforts to obtain the severance and,
    therefore, satisfy the condition precedent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span

    Seal Oil and General Corp.</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 633, at p. 661, Estey J. quoted
    the oft-cited passage from Viscount Haldane’s speech in the House of Lords’
    decision in <i>British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, Ltd. v.
    Underground Electric Railways Company of London, Ltd.</i>, [1912] A.C. 673, at
    p. 689, explaining the obligation to mitigate damages in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fundamental basis is
    thus compensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach; but
    this first principle is qualified by a second, which imposes on a plaintiff the
    duty of taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the
    breach, and debars him from claiming any part of the damage which is due to his
    neglect to take such steps … “The person who has broken the contract is not to
    be exposed to additional cost by reason of the plaintiffs not doing what they
    ought to have done as reasonable men, and the plaintiffs not being under any
    obligation to do anything otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.”
    [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found <span style='line-height:200%'>that </span><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>Southcott did not have a viable claim for
    specific performance.  Accordingly, Southcott was subject to the ordinary
    obligation imposed upon a party seeking damages for breach of contract to take
    reasonable steps to mitigate its damages.  In that regard, the remarks found in </span><i><span style='line-height:200%'>D<span class=ChrItal>omowicz et al v.
    Orsa Investments Ltd</span></span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>. (1994),

    are apposite:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One is not insulated from
    the duty to mitigate by merely instituting and pursuing proceedings for
    specific performance.  Before a party can rely on such conduct, it must have
    “some fair, real, and substantial justification” for its claim to specific performance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>[…]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, it is only where a plaintiff reasonably seeks
    specific performance that it will be permitted to postpone mitigation until

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=Prompt><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>A.        I just would – to have my lawyers say:
    “Don’t do that.”  For whatever reason it would just be a bad move.  And
    generally we wouldn’t buy anything in another company if it’s still involved in
    something.</span></span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=Prompt><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q.        All right.  But on that theory you would
    never ever<b> </b>mitigate your damages, would you?  You would never mitigate
    your damages.  You would never take any steps in Southcott to make sure your
    damages were as small as possible?</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=Prompt><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>A.        Southcott has got nothing to do with what we
    buy.  I mean, we are always buying and it’s not like this – that was – we are
    not saying that was our only project and I have never built anything since or
    bought anything since.  I can see that.  But we are always buying or trying to
    buy land or lots.</span></span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge made the following finding, at
    para. 137: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The plaintiff admitted that it never had any intention
    and never tried to mitigate the damages.  The plaintiff was a single purpose
    company incorporated solely for the purposes of this project with no assets
    other than the money advanced to it by Ballantry for the deposit. It was never
    intended that it would purchase other land.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The Board led expert evidence that 81 parcels of
    vacant undeveloped land in the Greater Toronto Area were sold between the date
    of breach and the date of trial</span><span lang=EN-US>;</span><span lang=EN> in the same time period, 49 properties subdivided into lots suitable for
    building were also sold.  That evidence was uncontroverted.  There was also
    evidence that Ballantry made several purchases of comparable lands for
    development purposes during this same period.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Despite the clear evidence and the clear finding
    that Southcott had failed to take any steps to mitigate, and despite the
    evidence of other available lands and other purchases made by Ballantry, the
    trial judge found that the Board did not meet its onus to demonstrate that
    Southcott had failed to mitigate. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge dismissed the Board’s expert
    evidence on the basis that there was no evidence that the numerous investment
    properties sold during the relevant period “were available to the public for sale”,
    and no evidence that any of these properties “could have been profitably
    developed” or that, had they been purchased, Southcott’s loss would have been
    avoided or reduced.  As for the properties actually purchased by Ballantry, and
    despite finding that Southcott failed to provide reliable evidence as to
    Ballantry’s financial situation, the trial judge found, at para. 143, that
    Ballantry had the financial capacity to make these purchases, regardless of the
    breach in the present case.  Further, he found that the purchases were
    “collateral, independent transactions that did not arise out of the
    consequences of the breach”, thereby not constituting mitigation of the loss
    claimed by Southcott.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>With respect, it is my view that the trial judge
    erred in law in his approach to mitigation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>First, Southcott’s admission that it had no
    intention of taking any steps to mitigate its loss was sufficient to satisfy
    the onus resting upon the Board to prove failure to mitigate and to shift the
    evidentiary onus to Southcott of demonstrating that, even if it had attempted
    to mitigate, it could not have done so.  Southcott led no evidence to that
    effect. In my view, the trial judge erred by holding that the Board had failed
    to meet the onus imposed upon it to prove that Southcott had failed to mitigate
    its damages.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Second, the trial judge erred in the manner in
    which he dealt with the evidence the Board led as to the land that was
    available, had Southcott been willing to mitigate.  By requiring the Board to
    prove the precise manner in which 81 parcels of investment land had been sold
    or to prove the profitability of individual parcels, the trial judge raised any
    bar the Board had to satisfy to an unrealistic level, particularly in the face
    of Southcott’s admission that it had no intention to mitigate and of the
    evidence that Ballantry actually did find other suitable development properties
    to purchase. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Third, the trial judge erred in the manner in which
    he dealt with the evidence of purchases made by Ballantry.  Those purchases
    clearly demonstrate that the directing mind of Southcott knew that investment
    quality lands, suitable for profitable development, were available on the
    market.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The plaintiff in this case was Southcott, a
    distinct legal entity, and the issue is whether it took reasonable steps to
    mitigate its damages.  Southcott cannot escape or avoid its duty to mitigate
    damages by arguing that it was a part of Ballantry and that Ballantry would
    have purchased the other lands even if this transaction had not failed.  Thus,
    the duty to mitigate rests upon Southcott. Southcott decided not to take any
    steps to mitigate damages.  Ballantry’s actions demonstrate that other good
    quality investment properties were available and that Southcott could have
    mitigated its losses. The controlling mind of Southcott decided not to put any
    assets in Southcott’s name to avoid exposing those assets to the risks
    associated with Southcott’s litigation against the Board.  Southcott and
    Ballantry were certainly entitled to claim the legal benefit of limited
    liability by virtue of Southcott’s distinct legal personality. However,
    Southcott and Ballantry also have to live with the consequences of the fact
    that because Southcott has a distinct legal personality, it is able to assert a
    claim for damages and, as a party asserting that claim, it thus bears the
    ordinary duty of mitigating its loss. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In my view, it is clear that Southcott, and those
    controlling Southcott, flatly repudiated or, at the very least, sought to avoid
    the legal duty imposed upon Southcott to mitigate its loss by purchasing
    property that would have mitigated Southcott’s loss in the name of other newly
    corporate entities and to, thereby, isolate such property from the legal
    consequences arising from this action. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred
    in failing to find that Southcott failed to make any effort to mitigate its
    loss.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Southcott made out a breach of contract but failed
