  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS </span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background:  Mr. Mathur, the IRAP and the role of ITAs.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 1994, the appellant, Rajkumar Mathur – an engineer by
    training – started working as an Industrial Technology Adviser (“ITA”) with the
    Industrial Research Assistance Program (the “IRAP”) at the National Research
    Council (the “NRC”).  The IRAP was designed to assist companies to develop
    technologies and processes by providing funding.  ITAs worked on a “client”
    basis, being assigned to specific companies and working with them throughout
    the pre- and post-funding phases of the IRAP.  The duties of an ITA included
    giving advice and assisting these companies with their funding proposal
    applications, as well as making recommendations on whether those applications
    should be approved.  Significant weight was placed on these recommendations by
    the Regional Director, who ultimately determined if a project should receive
    IRAP funding.  Any firm receiving NRC monies signed a contract, which included
    a clause stating no consideration had been given to the ITA.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IRAP funding applications were often very technical and
    complicated.  It was not unusual for companies to retain private consultants to
    help them prepare applications and navigate the proposal process.  Although the
    NRC forbids companies from hiring consultants on a contingency fee basis, such
    arrangements were common in the marketplace.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Mathur’s involvement with 778 and previous conflicts
    of interest.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately after starting work as an ITA, Mr. Mathur experienced
    difficulties with the NRC Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code (the
    “Code”).  Through his numbered company, 778481 Ontario Inc. (“778”), Mr. Mathur
    sought funding totalling $110,000 for two projects under the IRAP.  Mr. Mathur
    was the ITA for both projects.  On January 31, 1994, the NRC informed Mr.
    Mathur that he was “in a conflict of interest position” that had to be
    resolved.  On February 14, 1994, Mr. Mathur suggested a solution: 778 would
    withdraw its applications, he would sell his shares to an arm’s length company
    and until that sale occurred the shares would be transferred to his wife,
    Prithi Mathur.  Although the Secretary-General of the NRC initially did not
    find the trust arrangement acceptable, he informed Mr. Mathur on September 28,
    1994 that Mr. Mathur had indeed satisfied the conflict of interest requirements
    in the Code.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of September 8, 1994, Mr. Mathur was not an owner, director or
    officer or 778. Accordingly, all commissions, rewards, advantages or benefits
    of any kind paid to 778 from that point onward accrued directly to 778 and
    indirectly to Ms. Mathur – now President and owner of 778.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A new Code came into effect in December 1996.  In 2000, Mr. Mathur ran
    into difficulties with the (new) Code’s conflict of interest provisions.  One
    of Mr. Mathur’s clients, Energy Ventures Inc. (“EVI”), needed to develop a new
    business plan in order to apply for NRC funding.  Mr. Mathur provided them with
    a list of four private consultants capable of helping EVI in this regard, one
    of which was Mr. Mathur’s son, an employee of 778 at the time.  EVI eventually
    retained Mr. Mathur’s son – who was knowledgeable in the preparation of aspects
    of the funding applications – and Mr. Mathur was in the room when the contract
    was signed.  Mr. Mathur assured EVI’s President that his supervisor had
    approved of this arrangement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the NRC actually learned what had taken place, there was an
    investigation and the Director General disciplined Mr. Mathur for his “serious
    violation” of the Code with a ten-day suspension without pay.  Mr. Mathur was
    informed by the Director General that his actions: (i) betrayed public
    confidence in the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of the NRC; (ii)
    created a conflict between his private interests and his duties as a public
    servant; (iii) constituted preferential treatment in favour of his son; and
    (iv) resulted in a fee being paid to his son, which represented an economic
    benefit to Mr. Mathur (since his son lived with him in the same household). </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The relationship between Mr. Mathur, 778, Stratton &amp;
    Ogilvey and BCMC.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the 2000 incident, the Mathurs adopted a new approach.  Mr. Mathur
    referred some of his IRAP clients to a management consulting firm called
    Stratton &amp; Ogilvey (S&amp;O), which would then sub-contract some of the
    work involved in preparing proposals to 778.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Money received from the client was usually passed directly to 778.  In some
    cases, S&amp;O did absolutely no work on the proposals at all and the entirety
    of the fee was forwarded to 778.  Mr. David Benjamin, a business consultant for
    S&amp;O during the relevant period, testified that the firm did not inform
    clients that 778 was working on part/all of their proposals and that he had no
    idea whether Mr. Mathur worked on the applications or received any financial
    benefits personally from fees paid to 778.  The decision to use S&amp;O as a
    shield to hide the involvement of Ms. Mathur and her son in the preparation of
    proposals was a joint decision of Mr. Benjamin, Ms. Mathur and Mr. Mathur.  As
    a result of this arrangement, 778 received in excess of $300,000 for work done
    on the applications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on advice and contacts offered by Mr. Benjamin, Mr. Mathur
    incorporated an offshore corporation in Nassau, Bahamas called the Business
    Consulting and Marketing Corporation (“BCMC”).  During the relevant period, Mr.
    Mathur owned the BCMC and controlled its bank account, which was located in
    Antigua.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    alleged illegal transactions:  S&amp;O payment to 778 and PowerLoc payment to
    BCMC.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One client that retained S&amp;O for assistance with IRAP proposals was
    PowerLoc Technologies Inc. (“PowerLoc”).  On September 1, 2000, PowerLoc’s
    $495,000 funding proposal was approved.  Under the contingency-fee based
    consulting agreement in effect at the time, S&amp;O was owed 3 per cent of this
    amount for assisting in the preparation of the application (which works out to
    $14,850 before GST).  An invoice dated September 7, 2000 from S&amp;O to
    PowerLoc sets out the amount owing as $15,000 plus 7 per cent GST for a total
    of $16,050.  On December 10, 2000, PowerLoc forwarded a cheque for $16,050 to
    S&amp;O.  On December 30, 2000, S&amp;O wrote 778 a cheque for $28,433.34 – the
    sum total of the $16,050 cheque plus two other cheques received by S&amp;O for
    work done by 778 on another account.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 2001, S&amp;O and PowerLoc entered into a different
    contingency-fee based consulting agreement whereby PowerLoc agreed to pay 5 per
    cent of gross funds received through IRAP to S&amp;O.  The consulting fee was
    assigned to BCMC.  On November 19, 2001, PowerLoc’s $420,000 funding proposal
    was approved.  That same day, Mr. Mathur went to PowerLoc’s offices and
    presented an invoice for $21,000, payable in two instalments within 60 days
    (the same terms and quantum as in the S&amp;O 5 per cent contingency fee agreement). 
    On January 7, 2002, BCMC received $7,000 USD via wire transfer from PowerLoc’s
    parent company, Paradigm, in partial payment for the invoiced amount.  The
    second payment was never made. </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further explained his last point.  Notwithstanding the
    understanding urged by Mr. Mathur, he held the proper interpretation of s.
    121(1)(c) is that the phrase “for his benefit” does <i>not</i> apply to the
    phrase “through a member of his family” (see italicized portion in section). 
    He gave several reasons for prefering this construction to that advanced by Mr.
    Mathur:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the Crown were required to demonstrate a benefit to the

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 121(1)(b) is effectively a parallel provision to s.
    121(1)(c), targeting the “donors” of benefits instead of the “recipients”, and
    the structure of s. 121(1)(b) does not relate “for his benefit” to “any member
    of his family”;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    and 121(1)(f) (inducements to withdraw competing offers in government tendering

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The purpose of s. 121(1)(c) – to ensure both the integrity of the
    public service and the appearance of integrity in the public service – is
    better served by an interpretation that considers it sufficient for
    establishing liability if one’s family member receives actual benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that the payment to 778 (and therefore to Ms.
    Mathur) satisfied the conduct element of the offence.  Mr. Mathur’s awareness
    of the payments to 778 constituted the required state of mind – that is, the
    acceptance of the benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, we note that this ground of appeal does not impugn the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his interpretation
    of s. 121(1)(c) and his finding of guilt in relation to the payment to 778.  He
    submits that in order to be found guilty under the section, the government
    employee must personally benefit. In this case, the trial judge found that the
    appellant did not personally benefit from the payment to 778, yet he found him
    guilty. In so doing, it is argued that he erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The resolution of this issue requires us to apply statutory principles
    of interpretation. The literal approach to statutory interpretation has been
    superceded by the approach adopted by Iacobucci J. in <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>,<i> </i>[1998] 1 SCR 27, at para. 21, namely, “…the words
    of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
    ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the objective of the
    Act, and the intention of Parliament.” We agree that penal statutes are not to
    be given a strict construction but that every Act is to be given the
    interpretation that best ensures the attainment of its objects: <i>R. v.
    Hasselwander</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 398<i>.</i> With a bilingual statute,
    Parliamentary intention is still the governing principle. Applying these
    principles, we are of the opinion that the trial judge did not err in
    concluding that the appellant’s conduct infringed the section.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When a person has dealings with the government, s. 121(1)(c)
    criminalizes the conduct of an employee of the government who accepts a “<i>benefit
    of any kind directly or indirectly</i>, <i>by himself or through a member of
    his family or through any one for his benefit” </i>without the consent of his
    superior. The words “for his benefit” at the end of the phrase, modify the
    words, “through anyone” and do not modify the phrase “through a member of his
    family”. The appellant would have us read the phrase as, “through a member of
    his family for his benefit”.  That reading does not accord with either the
    wording of the section or the purpose of the provisions, which is to ensure
    that the appearance of the government’s integrity is not undermined.  The
    phrase, “by himself or through a member of his family or through any one for
    his benefit” explains the preceding words criminalizing acceptance of a benefit
    directly or indirectly.  The words “through a member of his family” deem a
    benefit to a family member to be a benefit to the accused and are included for
    the sake of clarity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his position, the appellant relied on the comments of
    L’Heureux-Dubé J. in <i>R. v. Hinchey</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128, para. 66,
    which read:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>...While conduct similar to that in the <i>Dubas</i> case might attract sanction under a government’s conflict of interest
    guidelines, it does not fall within the purpose or wording of s. 121(1)(c).&nbsp;
    It is true that the appearance of integrity may be harmed by such conduct, but
    it is not because the government employee<i>&nbsp;</i><i>personally benefits</i>.&nbsp;
    This particular section is designed to prevent an employee from actually
    benefiting.&nbsp; Where this does not occur, the criminal sanction is not
    warranted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The comments of L’Heureux-Dubé J. in <i>Hinchey</i>, <i>supra</i> do not
    support the interpretation advanced by the appellant.  L’Heureux-Dubé J. was
    distinguishing between actual and apparent benefits, and specified that the
    latter is an insufficient basis for criminal liability under s. 121(1)(c).  Her
    comments do not support the proposition that a government employee must personally
    benefit from a gift provided to his family member, but rather that a benefit
    received (either personally or to a family member) must be an actual one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the appellant took an active role in
    promoting the receipt of contracts from his clients by his wife’s company, in
    using Stratton and Ogilvy as a shield to hide the involvement of family members
    in preparing proposals for government grants and that he provided whatever
    assistance his wife needed on the proposals.  The trial judge did not impose
    absolute liability on the appellant. He held that the appellant knowingly
    directed financial gain to his spouse and son. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge said that the appellant did not receive a benefit
    what he meant was that the Crown did not have to prove anything beyond the
    benefit to the family member. We agree. We would uphold the appellant’s
    conviction in relation to the payment to 778. </p>

    Liaison Office (the “KLO”), whose jurisdiction included Antigua, for
    information that could be legally disclosed with respect to BCMC’s offshore
    account.  The KLO contacted the Antiguan government’s Office of National Drug
    and Money-Laundering Control Policy (the “ONDCP”), which provided the
    information.   On August 14, 2003, the RCMP asked for additional information
    that could also be publicly disclosed and once again the ONDCP obliged.<a

    Antigua and Barbuda for certified copies of the documents it had obtained in
    previous correspondence with the ONDCP.  These documents were provided to the
    RCMP.  In making its request for “available information”, the RCMP did not
    suggest extraordinary action was necessary, nor did it encourage or request
    that Antiguan laws be broken in the execution of their request for the
    certified copies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 23, 2006, Mr. Mathur wrote the Crown requesting information
    relating to the exact steps taken in obtaining the BCMC documents, suspecting
    that illegal activities were involved.  Mr. Mathur also requested certain
    documents, such as the notes of an Antiguan police officer working for the
    ONDCP, which required the Crown to bring an application under the Mutual Legal
    Assistance Treaty (the “MLAT”).<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    The Crown advised Mr. Mathur that “neither the Crown nor the RCMP are in
    possession or control of anything further to disclose to you on this topic.” 
    Mr. Mathur made demands in the same vein via a letter on December 7, 2006.  The
    Crown responded in much the same manner, noting that Mr. Mathur had “thus far
    provided no basis” for his allegations that the documents were illegally
    obtained and concluding that “the Crown is not obliged to engage in a defence
    investigation of the internal dealings of [Antigua and Barbuda].”<a

    times, the appellant was the “owner” of BCMC as the sole shareholder and

    to the trial judge that the appellant had signing authority on and therefore
    controlled BCMC’s bank account at the time of the transfer of funds from
    PowerLoc to BCMC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it turns out, the banking documents were not seized in accordance

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Decision Below</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to trial, Mr. Mathur moved for an order excluding these documents,
    arguing that their admission would render this trial unfair on the basis that
    (i) the Crown refrained from inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the
    obtaining of the documents; and (ii) the documents were obtained in a way that
    contravened the laws of Antigua. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to this ground of appeal, the trial judge held as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It was not enough for the Crown to take the position
    that the information requested was not in its possession:  the issue was
    whether it was under duty to make the inquiries sought by Mr. Mathur.  This
    duty can only flow from the nature of the role of the Crown prosecutor in Canada, but it is not necessary to decide whether such an obligation to assist the
    defendant existed in this case.  The essence of what occurred in Antigua is before the court, and where details are missing, inferences can be drawn; for
    example, the absence of details such as the Antiguan police officer’s notes
    supports the inference that the violation of Antiguan law was knowingly and
    deliberately done by domestic law enforcement officials.  Ultimately, it is
    sufficient in this case for the court to determine whether the admission of the
    evidence would be unfair. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to answer the question of whether the admission of the evidence
    would violate Mr. Mathur’s right to a fair trial guaranteed under ss. 7 and
    11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>, the application judge considered a number of relevant
    factors.  These included:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence is not a conscripted statement;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Antiguan authorities were not agents of the RCMP – they were
    authorities of a sovereign country carrying out a decision to cooperate with a
    Canadian request for assistance.  The RCMP did not perpetrate, instigate or
    otherwise cause the illegal activity to occur, and their actions were neither
    unreasonable nor unfair;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The BCMC banking documents were obtained without a warrant,
    contrary to Antiguan law (militating in favour of exclusion);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The documents are not essential to the prosecutor’s case, but

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The documents were obtained from Mr. Mathur’s bank, not from his
    home or person, and as such the impact on his expectation of privacy is less
    egregious;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The documents are reliable and existed independently of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, given the circumstances outlined above, the trial judge was
    not persuaded that the documents needed to be excluded in order to give Mr.
    Mathur a fair trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that he would not have been convicted of fraud on
    the government or of breach of trust by a public officer in relation to the
    PowerLoc payment to BCMC but for the trial judge’s erroneous admission of the BCMC
    banking documents. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the RCMP were in any
    way complicit in the unlawful activities of the Antiguan police.  Indeed, the
    record is to the contrary.  The correspondence from the RCMP to the authorities
    in Kingston, Jamaica (who directed the Antiguan police) make it clear that the
    RCMP sought out and requested only “publicly available” records in relation to
    the bank account information provided by PowerLoc.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that had he been provided with the particulars of
    exactly how the Antiguan police obtained these records, those details <i>may</i> have supported and strengthened his argument that the records should be
    excluded.  In this regard, the appellant relies on the words of Doherty J.A. of
    this court in <i>R. v. Ahluwalia </i>(2000), 138 O.A.C. 154, at para. 71, commenting
    on the Crown’s failure to inquire further when confronted with the perjury of
    its own witness:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For reasons not shared with this Court, the Crown
    does not appear to have regarded itself as under any obligation to get to the
    bottom of this matter.&nbsp; It contented itself with inquiries of counsel
    involved in the case and some of the Canadian police officers.&nbsp; The Crown
    does not appear to have made any inquiries of Makdesion or the F.B.I. agents
    responsible for providing Makdesion’s criminal record to the Crown.&nbsp; As
    those involved in the Canadian component of the investigation disavowed any
    knowledge of Makdesion’s full criminal record, inquiries of Makdesion and the
    relevant F.B.I. agents would have been the next obvious step.&nbsp; Not only
    was the Crown apparently uninterested in finding out what light Makdesion or
    Agent Carter might shed on the troubling questions raised in the fresh
    evidence, it also refused to assist the defence in obtaining that information
    by way of cross-examination of Makdesion or Agent Carter.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appellant’s reliance on <i>Ahluwalia</i> is misplaced. 
    The facts in that case are very different from the facts before this court.  In
    that case, defence counsel learned after trial that one of the Crown’s key
    witnesses, whose evidence was crucial to the conviction of <i>Ahluwalia</i>,
    was false and that he had thereby committed perjury.  The Crown refused to make
    any inquiries or efforts to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case there is no evidence whatsoever of any misconduct on the
    part of the RCMP.  As to the unlawful conduct of the Antiguan police, the trial
    judge accepted that this evidence had been obtained unlawfully, that the
    conduct was deliberate and in violation of the Constitution of Antigua. 
    Further in the agreed Statement of Fact filed in support of the appellant’s
    motion to exclude, the appellant agreed that for the purpose of the motion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Canadian authorities made no efforts to obtain a
    court order in the local jurisdiction, nor did they participate in the local
    investigation or seizure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the fact that the records had been unlawfully
    obtained weighed in favour of exclusion, but that it was not the only factor. 
    As was his duty, he weighed all the factors – those which favoured the
    admission of the records and those which favoured exclusion of the records.  He
    concluded, on balance, that the evidence favoured the admission of the records
    and dismissed the appellant’s motion to exclude.  His decision was a
    discretionary one – he weighed all of the relevant factors both for and against
    admission of the records and made his decision accordingly. We see no basis on
    which to interfere with his exercise of discretion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge had before him the evidence of a PowerLoc
    representative who received the appellant’s request for payment to BCMC and who
    provided the detail of how the payment was to be made to that company’s bank
    account in Antigua.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant admitted ownership of BCMC.  His evidence, however, in
    relation to the impugned transaction, was that his cousin S.D. Mathur at the
    particular time had signing authority on the bank account.  His cousin, he
    said, had done some work for PowerLoc in promoting that company’s business
    interests in India.  S.D. Mathur was said to be a citizen and resident of India
    and the $7,000 USD payment, which was the subject of one of the charges against
    the appellant, was in fact a payment to S.D. Mathur for work he had done for
    PowerLoc.  The money, according to the appellant, was paid into the BCMC
    account to help S.D. Mathur out and enable him to avoid Indian currency laws,
    to which as a citizen/resident, he would otherwise be subject had the money
    been paid to S.D. Mathur directly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence in this regard.  S.D.
    Mathur did not testify nor were any banking documents produced by the appellant
    to corroborate S.D. Mathur’s involvement in that bank account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court, however, still had the appellant’s own evidence that the
    account was that of BCMC – the Bahamian company of which the appellant was the
    sole director/shareholder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of his own evidence in relation to this account, the admission
    of the banking records can hardly be said to have rendered the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would reject this ground of appeal.</p>

    were heard in the morning, and following a brief recess, the trial judge
    sentenced the appellant to six months incarceration, followed by twelve months
    probation and one hundred hours of community service.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence sought a conditional sentence in the low to medium range,

  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in principle in failing

    case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge did not make any direct reference to a
    conditional sentence, however, it cannot be said that he was not alive to the
    issue.  It was the only position advanced by the defence.  Submissions had been
    made only very shortly before sentence was pronounced and in his reasons, his
    emphasis on general deterrence make it clear why he implicitly rejected a
    conditional sentence as he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In terms of the principles here, general deterrence
    is a paramount principle in this case.  Others who would occupy positions
    similar to Mr. Mathur, to the extent that they pay attention to this, must be
    deterred from thinking that this type of conduct, as exemplified and described
    in the reasons of this case, will be tolerated by the court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not the first time the appellant had run afoul of the rules
    which govern the conduct of government employees in his position.  He had been
    warned in the past and on another occasion suspended without pay for ten days
    for serious violation of the conflict of interest code.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the sentence imposed was a reasonable one and well within
    the range for this type of offence and for this offender.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, the appeal against conviction is dismissed,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal against sentence is
    dismissed.</p>

    received a further $7,033.34 from Mircom: see Reasons at para. 150.  Please
    note that, according to the record, the first payment ($5,350) was technically
    made by “Amsdell” and not Mircom, although nothing appears to turn on this
    distinction:  see ABC Vol. IV, Tab 26, p. 750.</p>
