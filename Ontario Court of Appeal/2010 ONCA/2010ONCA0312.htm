    decision of the Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) varying the registrar’s
    order on the taxation motion of the final Statement of Receipts and
    Disbursements (“SRD”) of the Trustee in the bankruptcy of Sally Creek Environs
    Corporation (“Sally Creek”).  </span></p>

    application to the registrar for approval of its fees, receipts and
    disbursements was vigorously and successfully opposed by the appellants,
    referred to collectively as “the Murphy Group”, an unsecured creditor of Sally
    Creek.  The registrar was scathingly critical of the Trustee and reduced his
    fees, disallowed significant disbursements and awarded solicitor client costs
    against the Trustee personally.  The registrar’s decision left the Trustee with
    $1 of income and </span><span style='line-height:200%'>more than $478,760.11 in
    personal liabilities</span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>. </span></p>

    in the Superior Court of Justice, Commercial List, (“commercial court judge”)
    upheld some of the registrar’s specific fee reductions and disallowances, but
    set aside others.  As well, she set aside the registrar’s costs award.  The commercial
    court judge’s decision left the Trustee with net income of $59,934.83 resulting
    from taxed fees in the amount of $87,664.44 and one disallowed disbursement of
    $27,729.61.  The commercial court judge awarded the Trustee party and party
    costs of the appeal before her in the amount of $55,000 all inclusive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    with in the courts below, the appellants take issue only with the commercial
    court judge’s dispositions on three matters: the bills of costs of the estate
    solicitor, the fees of the Trustee, and costs of the SRD hearing.  </span></p>

    measure by reinstating many of the registrar’s findings but varying several of
    his dispositions.  We would fix the Trustee’s fees in the amount of $</span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>49,464.44</span><span style='line-height:
200%'>, allow $100,000 and disallow $106,547.02 of the estate solicitor’s fees,
    and restore in part the registrar’s order that the Trustee pay the costs of the
    SRD hearing personally.  The portion of the costs payable by the Trustee
    personally are on a solicitor and client scale.  The balance of the costs, to
    be paid out of the estate, are on a party and party scale.  With respect to the
    appeals before the Superior Court and this court, we would make no costs award
    as, overall, each party has had mixed success.  Finally, the Trustee will be
    entitled to recover one half of his legal costs of the two appeals from the
    estate.</span></p>

    Bankruptcy and the commercial court judge provide a detailed description of the
    facts of this long and acrimonious dispute.  We summarize below only the facts
    that are relevant to this appeal.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Sally Creek Project and its Bankruptcy</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellants, A. Robert Murphy
    (“Murphy”), A. Robert Murphy Architect Incorporated, and Gray Wave Resources
    Inc., have been known collectively as the Murphy Group throughout these
    proceedings.  The Murphy Group was the largest unsecured creditor of the estate
    of Sally Creek Environs Corporation (Sally Creek), which owned land that it
    planned to develop into a retirement community and seniors’ complex.  The
    purchase of the land was funded through a mortgage held by other shareholders
    in Sally Creek, including several companies controlled by Ralph Rodgers, that
    have been referred to as the Rodgers Group in these proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Murphy signed an exclusive
    contract with Sally Creek to provide architectural services for the project. 
    The contract gave the Murphy Group a 20<i> </i> per cent interest in Sally
    Creek.  It also provided that Murphy would be entitled to approximately $2.5
    million should he waive his exclusive right to provide architectural services.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In late 2002, the mortgage on the
    land owned by Sally Creek became due.  As the project was facing financial
    difficulties, Ralph Rodgers called a meeting of the directors to seek a
    resolution to quit claim Sally Creek’s interest in the land to the mortgagees. 
    Apparently concerned that this would mean the loss of a unique and lucrative
    project, Murphy executed a plan to wrest control of Sally Creek from the
    Rodgers Group by successfully ousting a majority of the board of directors. 
    Having gained control of Sally Creek, Murphy, in his capacity as President of
    A. Robert Murphy Architect Incorporated, sent a letter to himself, as President
    of Sally Creek, pursuant to which he waived his exclusivity clause.  Sally
    Creek thus owed A. Robert Murphy Architect Incorporated approximately $2.5
    million. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'> Murphy caused Sally Creek to make
    an assignment in bankruptcy on January 10, 2003.  He appears to have intended
    to purchase the Sally Creek lands from the estate and continue the development
    project himself.  Murphy had the company of his then friend, Edward White of Edward
    White &amp; Associates Inc., appointed as Sally Creek’s Trustee in bankruptcy. 
    In these reasons we do not distinguish between Edward White and his company and
    refer to both as the “Trustee”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Murphy Group’s claims, the
    largest of which was the $2,583,432 damages claim arising out of the
    architectural services contract, amounted to approximately 80<i> </i> per cent
    of the unsecured claims of the estate.  The Trustee obtained two legal opinions
    regarding the Murphy Group claims, both of which held that they were valid for
    voting purposes.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The first meeting of creditors was
    held on January 29, 2003.  With its majority voting rights, the Murphy Group
    was able to have three persons it selected appointed as the inspectors.  According
    to the Trustee, following the creditors’ meeting the inspectors met briefly and
    approved the retainer of William J. Meyer as estate solicitor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Sally Creek property was the
    only significant asset of the estate.  In the spring of 2003, the Trustee sold
    the property for $7,155,000 to a third party known as the Sierra Group.  The
    sale price satisfied the mortgage debt, with $2,596,894.96 remaining in the
    estate for distribution among unsecured creditors.  The sale followed a
    contested tender and court approved sale in which the Murphy Group was an
    unsuccessful bidder.  The Murphy Group’s bid was rejected for technical
    deficiencies.  It contested the sale, eventually losing an appeal to this court:  <i>Sally Creek Environs Corp. (Re),</i> [2003] O.J. No. 3374.  Murray Page represented
    the estate in that litigation.  His retainer, and what actions it authorized,
    is a central issue in the present dispute.</span></p>

    found the Murphy Group’s claims to be valid.  However, in February 2003, the
    Rodgers Group took the position that the Murphy Group’s large unsecured claim
    was not a valid one.  It therefore indicated it would bring a motion under s.
    135(5) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”),
    to expunge or reduce the Murphy Group’s proof of claim or to annul the
    bankruptcy.  Pursuant to such a motion, the Rodgers Group would have borne the
    burden of proving that the Murphy Group claims were invalid or should be
    reduced despite the Trustee’s approval.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The relationships between Murphy
    and the Trustee and between the Trustee and the inspectors had become strained
    during the contested sale of the Sally Creek lands.  The Trustee had come to
    the conclusion that at least two of the inspectors were simply acting as
    proxies for the Murphy Group, and so believed he was justified in acting
    without their approval and at times contrary to their express wishes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Upon reading the Rodgers Group’s
    motion materials, Page came to the conclusion that the best way to settle the
    issue, along with certain other questions, was through arbitration.  On July
    23, 2003, Page wrote a letter to counsel for the Murphy Group in which he
    claimed to have been authorized by the Trustee to disallow the Murphy Group’s
    claims.  The Trustee’s disallowance of its claims would have meant that the
    Murphy Group would bear the burden of proving the validity of its claims in a
    hearing <i>de novo </i>pursuant to s. 135(4) of the <i>BIA</i>.  As noted, if
    the claims were allowed the Rodgers Group would have to contest them under s.
    135(5) and would bear the burden of proving that the Murphy Group claims were
    invalid.  Both the Trustee and Page admitted under cross-examination at the SRD
    hearing that the Trustee had no intention of disallowing the claims as he
    believed them to be valid.  The registrar found that Page’s repeated threat to
    do so was intended to pressure the Murphy Group to arbitrate its dispute with
    the Rodgers Group.  Furthermore, the registrar found that the issuance of these
    threats was beyond the scope of Page’s retainer and contrary to the express

    in this case.  However, the registrar found on the evidence before him that the
    Trustee had misled or lied to the professional bodies, and the results might
    have been different had he been truthful.  So, despite the resolution of the

    been taxed and paid.  The registrar found that the Trustee had retained Mr.
    Meyer without proper authorization by the inspectors, and so allowed his fees

    fees to $1 because of his misconduct, to protect the integrity of the
    insolvency system and to send “a clear message” to others “that this kind of
    conduct absolutely will not be tolerated by this Court”.  He itemized the
    Trustee’s misconduct in the following paragraphs in his decision:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee, and
    White, have lied to regulatory bodies about the conduct of this Estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee has
    failed to follow the instructions of the inspectors by participating in, and
    permitting Page to participate in, the arbitration.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee has
    failed to properly convene and minute meetings of the inspectors. This is both
    a breach of its statutory duties, and has resulted in activities being carried
    out which were not, in fact, authorized.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee, having
    allowed the Murphy claims, then permitted or encouraged Page to expend time,
    and cost others time and money, in responding to or dealing with, attempts to
    coerce an arbitration.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee, in so
    doing, has permitted its good name and office to be attached to what can only
    be characterized as the waging of a vendetta against Murphy, or at the very
    least, a shallow and misguided attempt to run up professional fees in the file.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee,
    according to the evidence of White, has tried to shield its actions behind
    those of Page. White very often raised the fact of Page being senior counsel as
    his response to why certain things were done or not done in the administration
    of the Estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee
    embarked upon a course of action to sell the major, if not only, Estate asset,
    without inspector approval.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee
    purposely declined to put a motion to the inspectors, in August, 2003, to
    confirm the retainer of Page, as he knew or believed that they would, instead,
    terminate Page’s relationship with the Estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee has
    allowed itself, through White, to become the pawn of a solicitor, and declined
    to exercise its own judgement, contrary to the letter and spirit of the BIA.
    For example, White testified that he did not rein in Page on the letter
    regarding the draft Disallowances. Neither did White explain why he permitted
    Page to keep the Estate involved in the determination of the Murphy claims, and
    not let the 135 motion run its course, as instructed by the inspectors.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee failed
    in its duty to properly invest the proceeds of the property sale, and then
    misled counsel as to when those proceeds were actually invested.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee failed
    to get in the Farm Show receipt, and permitted Page to keep it for years
    without accounting to the Estate for it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee,
    according to the evidence of Murphy which I accept for the reasons above,
    threatened Murphy by telling him that he (White) was surprised that Murphy’s
    solicitor had not taken Murphy aside and explained what happens to creditors
    who oppose trustees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee, in
    purporting to charge the Estate for professional time, and legal costs to
    defend itself and White, has demonstrated a willingness to prefer its own
    interests over those of the creditors whom it is charged with protecting.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee has
    failed in its obligations by not properly checking the accounts of
    professionals rendered to the Estate. For example, the $8,000.00 error in the
    Page Bill of Costs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee failed
    in its duty to provide sufficient information to the inspectors to do their
    jobs when he declined to advise them on the taxation process, or draft minutes
    of meetings in accordance with their wishes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee failed
    in its duty to the creditors in failing to bring the appropriate motion or
    motions to Court if White truly felt that the inspectors were refusing to act
    properly, or were being merely the handmaidens of Murphy, to the detriment of
    the other creditors.</p>

    should be taxed on a solicitor and client basis and that the Trustee should not
    be indemnified from the estate for these costs.  The registrar recognized that in
    so doing, he departed from the statutory presumptions set out in ss. 197(2) and
    (3) of the <i>BIA</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the registrar considered that the Murphy Group had been overwhelmingly
    successful in its objection to the Trustee’s SRD, and that, as a matter of
    policy, the participation of creditors in the insolvency process was to be
    encouraged.  He reasoned that not allowing costs to the Murphy Group, and not
    allowing them on a solicitor and client scale, would “discourage creditors from
    performing their very necessary and proper role of trustee oversight in
    insolvency matters.”  He noted that the Murphy Group’s action resulted in
    nearly $500,000 in additional funds being available for the estate to
    distribute, and that they had expended $200,000 of their own money on the
    hearing.  In the registrar’s view, no creditor would bring such a challenge and
    benefit the estate in this way without the expectation of solicitor and client
    costs if successful.  This view was based on the fact that creditors who attack
    the integrity of a Trustee and are unable to maintain their allegation face a
    serious risk of having solicitor and client costs awarded against them. 
    Therefore, the registrar concluded that costs should be fixed on the solicitor
    and client scale.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the Trustee should be reimbursed from the estate for the costs award made
    against him, the registrar began by observing that a trustee must act fairly
    and even-handedly, keeping in mind its role as an officer of the court and the
    duties it owes to all creditors, even those opposing it in the SRD hearing.  In
    presenting its SRD for taxation, a trustee implicitly announces to the court
    and the creditors that it has reviewed its work and the amounts it seeks are
    proper and allowable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Here, the Trustee had not provided
    proper dockets with descriptors of his work; had admitted to the missing Farm
    Show receivable only after several days of hearing; had claimed to have
    invested $2 million of proceeds from the sale of land for a year and only
    admitted that he had not after several days under cross-examination; had
    required the Murphy Group to call an expert from the Royal Bank to prove
    relevant interest rates; and had failed to fulfil undertakings from a
    pre-hearing conference to provide his staff’s day timers to fill in the missing
    descriptors.  These were but some examples of conduct that lengthened the
    hearing and increased the costs of the Murphy Group.  </span></p>

    to find that the Trustee’s inappropriate conduct was directed against the
    Murphy Group specifically and was a continuation of the “scorched earth”
    approach it had taken to the administration of the estate.  Observing that this
    misconduct went to “the heart of the administration of the estate”, the registrar
    found that the Trustee should not be reimbursed for the costs awarded to the
    Murphy Group.  He added the observation that, as the Murphy Group was the single
    largest creditor, “to indemnify the Trustee would be to do so, to the extent of
    some 81<i> </i> per cent, with the Murphy Group’s own money.” </span></p>

    that were beyond his jurisdiction.</span></p>

    finding that the Trustee had lied to regulatory bodies could not stand.  The
    regulatory bodies had investigated the Murphy Group’s complaints including
    those of perjury and had found no wrongdoing.  The Murphy Group could have applied
    for judicial review of the decisions of the regulatory bodies but chose not to. 
    She found it was beyond the registrar’s jurisdiction to make findings about
    what occurred in another forum and then to suggest that the regulatory bodies
    would have come to a different conclusion had they been given access to the
    same evidence that he had.  On the same reasoning, the commercial court judge
    held that the registrar acted outside his statutory authority by finding that
    the Trustee breached his statutory duties by failing to properly convene
    meetings of the inspectors and to carry out their instructions.</span></p>

    pointed out that the Murphy Group was represented throughout by counsel, and that
    the endorsement of Swinton J. dated September 29, 2003 noted that all parties
    were considering arbitration at that time.  She added that even if the Trustee
    had failed to control counsel appropriately, participation in the arbitration did
    not cause any harm to the estate.</span></p>

    out that the registrar had already reduced the Trustee’s fees by the amount of
    the losses to the estate caused by the Trustee’s failure to properly invest the
    proceeds of the property sale and to collect the Farm Show receivable. 
    Therefore, she held it was an error for him to rely on these failings as additional
    examples of the Trustee’s misconduct that warranted a further reduction of his
    fees.  She characterized this as “double counting”. </span></p>

    the commercial court judge agreed with the registrar that the Trustee had
    mismanaged the estate in significant ways and had engaged in conduct that was
    both unprofessional and sloppy.  He had followed a pattern of failing to obtain
    proper instructions from the inspectors and failing to seek the direction of
    the court where he was unable to obtain such instructions from the inspectors. 
    Looking at the circumstances in their totality, she observed that the Trustee “was
    clearly unable to manage appropriately the conflict between himself and counsel
    for the estate on the one hand, and the inspectors on the other.”  She added
    that the “conflict was exacerbated by the continued involvement of the Murphy
    Group’s counsel in the background (and foreground) – a situation the Trustee
    seemed incapable of controlling.”</span></p>

    found the registrar had erred in principle by further reducing the Trustee’s
    fees to $1.  She noted that in no previous case had a Trustee’s fees been
    reduced by more than 50 per cent and found that the registrar erred by
    departing from this “benchmark”.  As well, the registrar had imposed a punitive
    result and had failed to address what fair compensation would have been for the
    administration of the estate given that the Trustee sold the estate’s major
    asset for over $7 million, and achieved a recovery of $0.69 on the dollar for
    the unsecured creditors.</span></p>

    warranted.  The commercial court judge found that a reduction of the Trustee’s
    fees from $240,000 to $87,664.44 was more than ample to send the message that
    this kind of conduct would not be condoned by the court.  </span></p>

    including litigation and an appeal relating to that sale.  Retaining Page for
    this was necessary because a conflict of interest prevented the estate’s solicitor,
    William Meyer, from acting on the transaction and in the court proceedings
    regarding this bid.  The registrar found, however, that Page had carried out a
    considerable amount of unauthorized work, had presented at least one account
    containing a significant arithmetic error, had destroyed all of his dockets
    despite the Trustee having been put on notice that they would be required and
    generally had acted with arrogance or greed in an attempt to run up his fees. </span></p>

    creditor of the estate is thereby prevented from objecting to the trustee’s SRD
    as provided in s. 152(6) of the <i>BIA</i>.  In this sense, the appellants
    argue that this court should not follow the decision of a registrar of the

    the trustee is bound to pay the account and it cannot later be disallowed as a
    proper disbursement of the estate.  The respondent further argues that, even if
    the registrar had the authority to disallow the account as a proper
    disbursement of the estate, he erred in doing so.  In his analysis, the registrar
    gave little or no weight to the fact that at least one of the accounts had been
    approved by the inspectors and that all of the accounts had been taxed by the
    court.  In these circumstances, he erred in reducing the accounts or, in the

    The taxation of bills of costs for legal services is governed by rr. 18-25 of
    the <i>General Rules</i>.  The registrar will only agree to tax a bill of costs
    if the trustee is represented or signs a declaration stating that the trustee

    that the charges were reasonable (r. 20).  The registrar must then determine

    a final notice to every creditor, the registrar, the Superintendent and the
    bankrupt (s. 152(5)).  Those who wish to object must provide written notice of
    their intention to do so within 10 days (s. 152(6)).  The s. 152 process,
    therefore, involves creditors and others who would not necessarily have been
    aware of or involved in the taxation of the solicitor’s account pursuant to s.
    192(1)(i) and rr. 18-25.  Indeed, the s. 152 process will often be the

    192(1)(i) and rr. 18-25 is separate and distinct from the taxation of the
    trustee’s SRD pursuant to s. 152(6).  Indeed, the two appear to form a two-step
    process.  Section 192(1)(i) describes a process that will often not involve
    creditors.  The registrar will generally rely on the trustee’s assertion that
    the work being billed for was properly authorized and carried out.  It follows,
    therefore, that as between the trustee and the solicitor the work set out in
    the account is determined to have been authorized and the amount properly
    charged.  </span></p>

    taxation is not determinative of the issue to be addressed when a trustee
    presents his SRD for approval pursuant to s. 152(6).  The purpose of the SRD hearing
    is to determine whether the disbursements incurred by the trustee on behalf of
    the estate were proper and should be paid by the estate and, ultimately, the
    creditors.  Section 152(6) therefore allows creditors the opportunity to
    challenge the trustee’s disbursements and there is no language in that section
    that limits the types of disbursements that can be challenged. Thus, s. 152(6)
    allows creditors to challenge any disbursement, including taxed solicitors’
    accounts.  A s. 152(6) challenge does not, as found by the commercial court
    judge, constitute a collateral attack on another registrar’s finding under s.
    192(1)(i).  Insofar as these two processes create certain redundancies, such
    overlap is intended to provide appropriate scrutiny of the trustee’s management
    of the estate.</span></p>

    taxation of an account and the SRD hearing are distinct, the two processes are
    not totally unrelated.  In our view, the two steps in the process should work
    in harmony so as to ensure that the interests of all affected parties are
    fairly considered while at the same time avoiding repetition and unnecessary
    expense.</span></p>

    bill of costs is presented at an SRD hearing, it will normally have been
    scrutinized by both the court and the inspectors.  When a solicitor’s account
    has been taxed by the court, a registrar will have assessed the reasonableness
    of the account and, based on the representations of the trustee, determined
    that the work was approved and the amounts charged were reasonable.  In
    addition, the inspectors will normally have approved the solicitor’s retainer as
    well as approving of the solicitor’s accounts in advance of their being paid.  It
    is important to keep in mind the role of the inspectors in giving such
    approval.  They represent the creditors throughout the administration of the
    estate and when they approve of disbursements they do so on behalf of the
    creditors.  Thus, at an SRD hearing, there should be a presumption that a
    previously taxed bill of costs should be paid by the estate provided that the
    services covered by the bill had been authorized by the inspectors and the
    inspectors had approved the bill before taxation.</span></p>

    of necessity, be quite narrow.  In essence, the court will decide whether there
    is reason to look behind the trustee’s approval, the inspectors’ approval (if
    any), and the court’s previous taxation of the account and whether, in the
    circumstances, the trustee should be prevented from claiming all or part of the

    taxed they had the same effect as a court order and could be enforced as such. 
    Once the bills of costs were taxed, the solicitor could recover them.  In fact,
    by the time the SRD hearing took place before the registrar, Page’s legal
    accounts had been taxed and paid out of the estate.  The decision the registrar
    was called upon to make was not whether the solicitor would be permitted to

    carried out by Page was, to the knowledge of the Trustee, not authorized by the
    inspectors.  In fact, some of the work was carried out in the face of express opposition
    by the inspectors.  In this context, it was open to conclude that it was
    necessary to look behind the previous taxation of Page’s bills of costs, as
    well as the approval of the Trustee and the inspectors as the s. 152(6) hearing
    was, in practical terms, the first opportunity creditors had to challenge the

    creditors at a s. 152(6) hearing.  This concession was correct and, no doubt,

    solicitor.  The inspectors’ approval of a retainer does not, however, give
    carte blanche to the trustee to involve the solicitor in any and all matters
    pertaining to the bankrupt estate.  This is made clear by the wording of s.
    30(1)(e) which authorizes the trustee to “employ a barrister or solicitor…to
    take any proceedings or do any business that may be sanctioned by the
    inspectors.”  It is well established that where a trustee hires a solicitor or
    undertakes litigation without the approval of the inspectors, he can be held
    personally liable for the costs and may be prevented from being reimbursed from
    the estate:  see <i>The 2009 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </i>at pp.
    898 and 103-104.  A solicitor’s retainer is thus usually limited to providing
    the services that have been approved by the inspectors.  If, as in the present
    case, the inspectors make it clear that they do not wish the solicitor to be
    involved in certain matters, the trustee will normally be expected to respect
    such limits.  If he does not, he does so at his peril.  </span></p>

    a result, in the appellants’ view, the inspectors would not have understood

    of the work covered by this account was not within the scope of the retainer
    approved by the inspectors and was contrary to the wishes of the inspectors,
    the registrar was entitled to look behind their approval.  Because Page’s
    dockets had been destroyed, the registrar was unable to breakdown the charges
    in the account into authorized and unauthorized work.  He therefore relied on his
    experience and decided that $20,000 was a reasonable charge for the work
    carried out to complete the sale of the property.  A detailed analysis was not
    possible due to the absence of dockets.  Although there are entries for work
    that the registrar found was never authorized, on our review of the narrative
    of that account, the majority of the time billed for appears to have been spent
    on authorized tasks, including the sale of the Sally Creek lands and
    representing the estate in litigation related to that sale.</span></p>

    record suggests that they were not.  Indeed, the registrar took no issue with
    these amounts, but rather based his reduction on his finding that many of the
    tasks had not been authorized.  Accepting these amounts to be reasonable and
    considering that the bulk of the work detailed in the first bill of costs was
    approved, the registrar’s reduction to all of the Page accounts from a total of
    $206,547.22 to $20,000 to account for unauthorized work was, in our view, unreasonable. 
    In our view, the value of the authorized work should be set at $100,000
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.  The bulk of the authorized work was
    encompassed in the first bill and, as a result, we would adjust the first bill,

    together with s. 152 of the <i>BIA </i>as allowing the registrar a wide discretion
    to set the appropriate amount of a trustee’s fees.  There is no dispute that
    this includes the authority to reduce a trustee’s fees for specific acts of
    misconduct that have cost the estate quantifiable amounts.  This ensures that
    the trustee will not receive “unjustifiable payments for fees to the detriment
    of the estate and the creditors.” In our view, it is also within the
    jurisdiction of the registrar to reduce a trustee’s fees further in appropriate
    cases.  This further reduction of a trustee’s fees advances the third principle
    set out in <i>Nelson</i>.  </span></p>

    of the public interest in the proper carrying out of the principles and
    objectives of the <i>BIA</i> is a valid objective of such reductions, it is not
    the role of the registrar to punish trustees for misconduct.  Rather, the
    reduction is made in recognition of the fact that, through his misconduct, the trustee
    has not acted in a way that merits collection of his fees in their full
    amount.  In such situations, for the court to allow the trustee his fees in
    their entirety would be to endorse his conduct.  A further reduction also helps
    uphold the principles and objectives of the <i>BIA</i> by expressing the court’s
    displeasure with the conduct in question: see <i>Nelson </i>at para. 23.</span></p>

    and mismanagement.  However, bankrupt estates differ widely in size and
    complexity and the range of potential trustee misconduct is simply too wide to
    make the adoption of such a rigid standard sensible.  The size of the estates and
    the quantum of trustee fees in the previous cases were much smaller.   A 50 per

    throughout and the arbitrator had ruled that the Trustee should participate in

    Trustee abused his statutory authority by allowing Page to threaten to disallow
    the Murphy Group’s claims despite believing them to be valid and, in fact,
    having already approved them.  The threat was an admitted tactical ploy to
    persuade the Murphy group to agree to arbitration.  It is reasonable to assume

    Management Inc. (Re)</i>, [2008] 41 C.B.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 86 (Ont. S.C.).  This
    stands to reason.  In bringing necessary proceedings, the Trustee is simply
    carrying out his statutory duties and defending the interests of the estate. 
    He should not therefore be held personally liable for costs, unless it is found
    that those proceedings were in fact contrary to the interests of the estate.  </span></p>

    however, the trustee is in a peculiar position.  The proceeding is required by
    statute but, to some extent, the trustee is advancing his own financial
    interests and not those of the estate.  It can be, in some cases or with
    respect to some issues, an adversarial hearing between one or more creditors
    and the trustee.  A consideration of whether to reimburse a trustee for the
    costs of such a hearing must take into account this dual nature of the SRD
    hearing.  A trustee must not be punished for simply carrying out a statutory
    duty, but in carrying out this duty he is still bound by his duty to the court
    and must not be permitted to use such a proceeding to advance his own interests
    at the cost of the estate and, ultimately, the creditors who oppose him.</span></p>

    that the registrar’s findings were supported in the record, the registrar
    ought, in our view, to have given appropriate weight to the fact that the

    prepare and submit an SRD and, when challenged, appear at the hearing to
    justify the disbursements and his fees.  </span></p>

    arising from the SRD hearing in this case can be viewed as falling into one of two
    categories.  One category includes the costs that would of necessity arise from
    the hearing as mandated by the statute.  The second category includes costs
    that arise from the part of the proceeding that the registrar found was
    unnecessary and improperly pursued by the Trustee in breach of his duty to the
    court, wherein the Trustee sought recovery of inappropriate fees and disbursements
    and acted in furtherance of his “scorched earth policy” against the
    appellants.  Viewing the costs associated with the hearing in this way, the
    appropriate disposition is to permit the Trustee to be indemnified for the
    portion of the costs which arose out of necessity, but deny reimbursement for
    those costs incurred as a result of what the registrar termed the Trustee’s “scorched
    earth policy” in pursuit of his own interests.  In our view, such an approach
    will only be appropriate in exceptional cases.  Indeed, it will be both
    unnecessary and undesirable for registrars to attempt to parse out the costs of
    SRD hearings in this way in all but the most extreme cases.  In the present
    case, however, the findings of misconduct by the Trustee are such that it would
    be unfair to the creditors to have to indemnify the Trustee for the whole of
    the costs award.  </span></p>

    determine the portion of the costs award made against the Trustee to be paid by
    the estate?  This was a substantial estate and an SRD hearing would necessarily
    take time.  It is impossible to determine this figure with precision.  From our
    review of the proceedings it is fair to say that a substantial part of the
    hearing dealt with issues addressed in the normal course of an SRD hearing.  As
    well, there was, to some extent, time taken up by the appellants during
    cross-examination pursuing issues on which they were unsuccessful and
    repeatedly returning to lines of questioning in a manner that reflected the
    obvious animosity of the appellants toward the Trustee and Page.  Taking this
    as well as the findings of the registrar into account, we are of the view that
    50 per cent of the costs of the SRD hearing can fairly be attributed to trustee
    misconduct.  The other 50 per cent we would attribute to what we would term the
    statutorily provided component of the hearing.  As a result, we would limit the
    Trustee’s recovery from the estate of costs awarded against him to this latter
    50 per cent.</span></p>

    principle that solicitor and client costs ought to be awarded only where there
    has been “reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct”: see <i>Young v.
    Young</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3.  Further, the respondent argues that s. 197(2) of
    the <i>BIA</i> creates a statutory presumption that costs will be on a party
    and party scale.  Nothing in the conduct of the Trustee warrants displacing
    this statutory presumption.  </span></p>

    in court under this Act are in the discretion of the court.”  Subsections (2)
    and (3) create presumptions for party and party costs to be paid from the

    this does not diminish the duties that the court and the estate’s creditors
    were owed by the Trustee, nor the high standards of conduct that both were
    entitled to expect of him.  The registrar’s findings with respect to the Trustee’s
    conduct were very critical.  These findings, and the registrar’s exercise of
    discretion with respect to costs, were entitled to deference by the commercial

    ultimately, sanction only creditors other than the Murphy Group for the Trustee’s
    conduct and would see the Murphy Group, as the major creditors, funding the
    bulk of the Trustee’s costs out of its share of the estate.  On the other hand,
    half of the expenses incurred at the hearing were necessary and would have been
    paid from the estate in the normal course.  In order to balance these factors,
    we find that the 50 per cent of the costs to be paid by the Trustee are to be
    calculated on a solicitor and client basis, whereas the 50 per cent of the
    costs for which he is to be reimbursed are to be calculated on a party and
    party basis.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In reaching this conclusion we
    have considered the registrar’s comment that the policy consideration of
    encouraging creditor participation in bankruptcy proceedings justifies the award
    of costs on a solicitor and client scale.  Assuming without deciding that this
    could potentially be a valid reason to award costs on a solicitor and client
    scale, we do not believe that this consideration applies in a case such as this
    one.  Given the Murphy Group’s financial interests in the estate, they had
    ample incentive to oppose the Trustee at the SRD hearing.  As the registrar
    noted, this opposition resulted in a net benefit to the estate which ultimately
    benefitted the Murphy Group as the major creditor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    calculated solicitor and client costs at $181,789.81.  The commercial court
    judge calculated party and party costs at $141,718.75.  We would therefore
    award the Murphy Group $90,894.91 in costs for which the Trustee will not be
    reimbursed from the estate, and $70,859.38 in costs for which the Trustee will
    be reimbursed from the estate.  The end result is that the Murphy Group is
    awarded a total of $161,754.29, a substantial amount that reflects their
    success at the SRD, holds the Trustee accountable for his behavior at that
    hearing, and ensures that the estate will pay only those costs that would
    normally be associated with an SRD hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    this admittedly unusual costs disposition is a product of the unusual facts of
    this case.  The vast majority of cost awards arising from SRD hearings have and
    will continue to follow the statutory presumptions of party and party costs
    paid from the estate.  However, the facts of this case dictate the need for a
    unique solution that balances the need to reimburse the Murphy Group, sanction
    the Trustee’s conduct at the hearing, and protect the non-aligned creditors.</span></p>

    reasonably be said that the end result of the appeals before the commercial

    several findings of the commercial court judge, at the end of the day the
    Trustee is nonetheless in a better position than he had been after the registrar’s
    decision at the SRD hearing.  On balance, the result of the two appeals
    considered together is a mix of success for each party.  In these circumstances
    we consider it appropriate that the parties bear their own costs in both
    proceedings.  The costs award of the commercial court judge of $60,000 to the
    Trustee is set aside and there shall be no costs awarded to either party for
    this appeal. </span></p>

    judge’s order awarding the Trustee $55,000 in costs against the Murphy Group
    provided that the Trustee be allowed to recover the balance of his costs from
    the Estate.  The Trustee submits that the presumption that he is entitled to
    recover his costs of the appeal to the Superior Court and this court from the
    estate should be applied.  The Murphy Group, however, submits that the Trustee
    should not be entitled to recover his costs from the estate as it would, despite
    our order that neither the Trustee nor the Murphy Group receive costs, mean
    that the Murphy Group as principal creditors of the estate will effectively pay
    approximately 80 per cent of those costs.</span></p>

    reasoning that led the court to require the Trustee to pay 50 per cent of the
    Murphy Group’s costs personally applies to the recovery of his own costs from
    the Estate.  Considering the registrar’s findings of misconduct and our
    decision to award neither party costs, it is appropriate, in our view, that
    some of the costs incurred by the Trustee not be recovered from the estate.  To
    do otherwise would be to penalize the creditors for the Trustee’s misconduct.  </span></p>

    can be recovered, one might argue that, but for the misconduct, there would
    have been no appeals.  This, however, must be balanced by the fact that the
    Trustee was fully entitled to bring the appeals and, as noted earlier, the
    Trustee has, in some respects, been successful.  As a result, we would apply
    the same 50 per cent measure and would allow the Trustee to recover from the
    estate 50<i> </i> per cent of the costs he incurred before the Superior Court
    and this court.</span></p>

    approval of the SRD, but rather included a comment that, “[t]he Inspectors, all
