  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By The Court:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Newcastle Recycling Ltd., JCLJB Holdings Ltd. and various
    members of the Hale family appeal from the order of Mulligan J. dated April 2,
    2009, permanently enjoining them from “carrying on the operation of a scrap
    yard, landfill, garbage collection and/or garbage transfer business” on certain
    lands owned by Newcastle, referred to as the B Parcels, situated in the Municipality
    of Clarington.  The appellants also appeal from a related aspect of the order
    requiring them to “remove at their own expense all materials deposited ... on
    the B Parcel other than tire storage and auto wrecking.” Finally, the
    individual appellants and JCLJB appeal from Mulligan J.’s costs order, dated
    July 17, 2009, to the extent that it holds them, along with Newcastle,
    responsible for the costs of the trial proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the second appeal to this court by the same parties, involving
    the same parcels of land, and the same overriding issue, namely: whether the
    appellants, and in particular Newcastle, have acquired a legally protected non-conforming
    use which entitles Newcastle to use the B Parcels to store and recycle scrap
    metal and “white goods”, such as fridges and stoves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That issue formed one of several issues in a trial that initially took
    place before Boyko J. in 2004. In an appeal and cross-appeal to this court from
    Boyko J.’s order, both sides took issue with her findings and conclusions in
    respect of the B Parcels, along with other matters that have no bearing on the
    present appeal. With respect to the B Parcels, the appeal and cross-appeal
    proved successful and by order dated December&nbsp;14, 2005, this court
    directed the trial of an issue, before a different judge, on the following two
    matters:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO> (i)        Whether
    a legal non-conforming use has been established on parcels B1 and B2; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(ii)      Whether
    the appellant [the Municipality] is entitled to a permanent injunction in
    respect of the B Parcels, as originally sought by the appellant in its
    counter-application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial of those issues proceeded before Mulligan J. on October 14,
    2008. Evidence was heard over the course of 8 days and the parties made closing
    submissions on February 5 and 6, 2009. On April 2, 2009, Mulligan J. released
    extensive reasons for judgment in which he vindicated the Municipality’s
    position and granted the injunctive relief that forms the subject of this
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge
    framed the issues, as he understood them to be, at paras. 6, 38, and 40 of his
    reasons, as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[6]       … The issue before the
    court is whether or not the Hales have established a lawful non-conforming use
    on two discreet portions of Lot 12, Concession 3, known as Parcel A-3 and the B
    Parcels prior to the establishment of the by-law and its subsequent amendments.
    If lawful non-conforming uses were so established, a further issue is whether
    or not those uses were discontinued or abandoned such as to lose the protection
    afforded in the by-law.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[38]     It is clear that on the B
    Parcels, by reason of the Municipality’s by-law or recognition of pre-existing
    uses, tire storage and a motor vehicle wrecking yard are permitted uses. The
    issue before the court is whether or not the Hales have established the use of
    the property as a scrap yard and the collection and storage of white goods,
    such as fridges, stoves, etc. If those uses were established prior to the 1968
    by-law was there a discontinuance of use such as would end the protection of
    the use afforded by the zoning by-law.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[40]     … Based on the evidence
    of Mr. Hale Sr. and Mr. Hale Jr., I am satisfied that there was some storage of
    scrap metal and white goods on the B Parcel when the by-law was passed in 1968.
    That would therefore give these uses the protection afforded by the by-law in
    1968. However, the B Parcel is now being used for the storage of scrap metal
    and white goods. The issue before the court is whether or not these uses were
    discontinued in previous years so as to lose the protection of the
    non-conforming use section of the by-law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s reference in para. 40 to the
    “protection afforded” by the 1968 by-law is a reference to s. 12 of the by-law,
    quoted at para. 6 of his reasons, which provided that non-conforming uses could
    continue. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given the trial judge’s finding, at para. 40,
    that “there was some storage of scrap metals and white goods on the B Parcel
    when the by-law was passed in 1968” and his further finding that those uses
    were protected under s. 12 of the by-law, the only remaining issue, according
    to the trial judge, was “whether or not these uses were discontinued in
    previous years so as to lose the protection of the non-conforming use section
    of the by-law.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In responding to that question, the trial judge
    engaged in an exhaustive review of the pertinent evidence. As his reasons demonstrate,
    the problem for the Hales was that in 1972, they sold the B Parcels to a man
    named Harold Price and did not reacquire them until 1982. During that ten-year
    period, Mr. Price used the property to carry on his business, the primary focus
    of which “was the collection and storage of used tires, together with some
    limited auto wrecking.” From the Hales’ perspective, that was not fatal, so
    long as it could be shown that during the ten-year period, when they were not
    in possession of the property, the property continued to be used, even on a
    minor scale, for the storage and recycling of scrap metal and white goods. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately for the Hales, they failed to
    satisfy the trial judge of this.  At para.&nbsp;60 of his reasons, the trial
    judge made the following findings of fact:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[60]     The Hales did not own the
    B Parcels from 1972 to 1982 when the property belonged to Harold Price or his
    company. Mr.&nbsp;Price passed away before this litigation commenced; however,
    he was actively engaged in minor variance and re-zoning applications with the municipality.
    In addition, he provided a Statutory Declaration to the Hales after he sold the
    property to them. In all such documents he was careful to acknowledge that the
    use of the property during his ownership was for his tire storage business and
    for auto wrecking. <i>None of these documents mentioned a scrap yard or the
    storage of white goods. Although Mr. Hale Sr. may have been using the property
    for this purpose prior to the first by-law in 1968, I am not satisfied that
    these uses continued throughout the Price period of ownership</i>. The aerial
    photograph taken in 1978 during Mr. Price’s ownership showed no evidence of a
    scrap yard or the storage of white goods. <i>I am satisfied on all the evidence
    that these uses were only resumed after the Hales’ reacquired the property in
    1982 and only after a prolonged discontinuance. In my view the municipality has
    satisfied the onus upon it and is entitled to the relief sought in its
    counter-application prohibiting the use of the B Parcel as a scrap yard or for
    the storage of white goods</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellants do not take issue with
    the trial judge’s conclusion that the use of the property to store and recycle
    scrap metal and white goods was discontinued for the ten-year period in which
    Mr. Price owned the property; nor could they. The trial judge’s findings in
    this regard are amply supported by the evidence and in our view, they are unassailable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Instead, the appellants raise the following two
    grounds of appeal which are found at para. 19 of their factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Did the Trial Judge err in finding that the depositing and sorting
    of scrap metal, including white goods, on the B Parcels, was not legal
    non-conforming?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Did the Trial Judge err in granting the Municipality injunctive
    relief prohibiting the Appellants from depositing and sorting “scrap” on B2
    without addressing the argument that such “use” is in fact accessory to the
    permitted principal use of a motor vehicle wrecking yard?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A bare-bones summary of the appellants’ first
    ground of appeal is found at para. 20 of the appellants’ factum as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Appellants submit that in determining
    whether a particular activity is part of a legal non-conforming use the court
    must apply the approach set forth by the majority decision in the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Saint-Romuald (Ville) c. Olivier</i> [[2001] 2 S.C.R. 898].</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 22 of their factum, the appellants
    flesh out this ground of appeal as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Appellants submit that having
    concluded that a motor vehicle wrecking yard and tire storage was permissible
    on B2 because of the zoning by-law and because it was legal non-conforming it
    was incumbent on the Trial Judge to apply the test set forth in <i>Saint-Romuald
    (Ville)</i> to determine if the activity of collecting scrap and/or white goods
    could also be deemed to be legally non-conforming. The Appellants’ position is
    that if you apply the approach set out in <i>Saint-Romuald (Ville)</i> the
    depositing and sorting of scrap metal on B2 is permissible because:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The recognized pre-existing use consisted of a
    number of activities including tire storage, carrying on a motor vehicle
    wrecking yard. The “<b>purpose</b>” of this use was recycling. Even if the
    activity of collecting scrap was discontinued the <i>Saint-Romuald (Ville)</i> approach allows for it be brought back if it is within the scope of the
    original purpose which was recycling. In fact this new approach even allows for
    a new “activity” that has never been carried on at the property if it is within
    the scope of the original purpose. The new approach requires that an assessment
    be made of the community interest vs. the interest of the property owner and it
    also requires a consideration of “neighbourhood” effects. In this case there
    was no evidence whatsoever of any negative neighbourhood effects resulting from
    the depositing and sorting of scrap on B2 and in fact “recycling” is in the
    community interest. The evidence was that the Appellants are serving the needs
    and interests of the Region of Durham as they have a contract with the Region
    for the collection of the Region’s white goods recyclables.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Appellants argue that following the <i>Saint-Romuald
    (Ville)</i> approach, the depositing and sorting of scrap metal on B2 should be
    found to be legally non-conforming.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants second ground of appeal is
    summarized at para. 25 of their factum as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Appellants argue that it is
    not unusual for a motor vehicle wrecking yard to also have a small intake
    percentage of other scrap metal that is not in the form of wrecked motor
    vehicles and furthermore it is all devoted to the same purpose of recycling
    “scrap metal”. The Trial Judge erred in granting injunctive relief without ever
    addressing this issue. If the depositing and sorting of white goods on B2 is an
    accessory use then the injunctive relief is inappropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Leaving aside for the moment whether those grounds,
    or either of them, has merit, the appellants face an initial hurdle. The Municipality,
    in its factum, submits that the second issue (accessory use) was not raised at
    trial. As for the first issue (the <i>Saint-Romuald</i> issue), in oral
    argument, the court sought clarification from counsel for the appellants as to whether
    it had been raised at trial. Our concern stemmed from the fact that the trial judge’s
    reasons, which by any standard are exemplary, make no mention of it – or the “accessory
    use” issue. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the appellants responded in a less
    than certain fashion. Upon request, he willingly produced the factum that he
    had filed with the trial judge. Unfortunately, it does not assist the
    appellants.  In contrast, counsel for the Municipality was adamant that neither
    issue was raised at trial. In support of this contention, he too referred to
    the thoroughness of the trial judge’s reasons. Moreover, he pointed to the
    evidentiary record and in particular, the absence of pertinent evidence the Municipality
    would have called to address the issues had they been raised at trial. Because
    of that, the Municipality urges us not to entertain the appellants’ arguments,
    regardless of their potential merit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this regard, the Municipality submits that
    because the record is incomplete, the most we could do would be to order a new
    trial – and that would be very unfair to the Municipality. The appellants have
    already had two bites at the cherry and they should not be permitted a third.
    They have been ably represented throughout by counsel and no valid reason has
    been offered to explain why the two issues that the appellants seek to argue on
    appeal were not raised at trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Municipality relies on an established body
    of authority in support of its position that we should not entertain argument
    on the new issues: <i>R. v. Perka</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232; <i>Farr-Mor
    Fertilizer Services Ltd. v. Hawkeye Tanks and Equipment Inc.</i>, [2002] SKCA

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree with the position taken by the Municipality
    and would accordingly dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In short, we are satisfied that the issues which
    the appellants now seek to argue were not raised at trial. Had they been, we
    are confident that the learned trial judge would have addressed them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We also acknowledge the Municipality’s concern
    that the record before us is incomplete and for that reason, we are not in a
    position to resolve the new issues. The only available remedy would be to order
    a new trial and the Municipality, in our view, ought not to have to relitigate,
    for a third time, a matter that originated in 2002.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Our decision to leave the appeal untested on the
    merits has not been taken lightly. We are particularly concerned by the “<i>Saint-Romuald</i>”
    issue raised by the appellants. Whether the appellants would have succeeded had
    they raised it at trial, we cannot say; but in disposing the appeal as we have,
    we should not be taken as diminishing its potential merit. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>COSTS AT TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning to the costs appeal, because we have
    dismissed the main appeal, the appellants require leave to appeal. In the
    circumstances, we would grant leave but dismiss the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge addressed the issue as to
    whether Newcastle should bear sole responsibility for costs of the proceeding
    before him. At para. 8 of his costs endorsement, the trial judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Newcastle raises the issue in its
    submissions of whether or not costs should be against all of the applicants.
    That issue was not raised at trial. There was no application to have any of the
    named applicants released from this matter. I am therefore not prepared to
    grant relief on that issue in a costs submission after trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s
    decision. Accordingly, the appeal from costs is dismissed.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>COSTS OF THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If the parties cannot agree on the costs of the
    appeal, they may file written submissions, not exceeding 3 pages double-spaced,
    within 10 days of the release of these reasons.</span></p>
