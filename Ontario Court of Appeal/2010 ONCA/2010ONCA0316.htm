  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Szanyi has admitted to robbing and killing Billy Smith during the
    early morning hours of November 16, 2004.  He was 17 years old at the time.  At
    the opening of trial, he pled guilty to robbery and manslaughter, but the Crown
    declined to accept the plea to manslaughter.  He was convicted of robbery and
    of second degree murder by Justice David Little of the Superior Court of
    Justice (sitting as a Youth Court Judge) and a jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only significant issue at trial was whether the appellant had the
    necessary mental intent for murder.  The jury concluded that he did and
    convicted.  He appeals from that conviction, alleging that the trial judge
    erred:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by failing
    to provide an instruction specifically explaining how the common sense inference
    (that a person generally intends the natural and probable consequences of his
    or her act) may be affected by evidence of intoxication;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by failing
    to instruct the jury on the differing effects of “mild” intoxication and
    “advanced” intoxication on the requisite <i>mens rea</i> for second degree
    murder;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by failing
    to incorporate a reference to “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” in his answer
    to a jury clarification question regarding the decision tree for second degree
    murder; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:200%'>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by failing
    to give the jury a prohibited inference caution regarding bad character
    evidence in relation to evidence arising from a “Mr. Big” operation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to any of these grounds of appeal, and would
    dismiss the appeal, for the reasons that follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before proceeding further, however, I note that s. 110(2) of the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c.1, permits publication of the identity
    of the appellant once he has been sentenced as an adult, which is the case
    here.  At trial, however, the judge ordered that the Crown receive notice if
    anyone applies to copy or broadcast video exhibits showing undercover police
    officers.  On consent, that order is continued.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p><u>The Fatal Incident</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and his young friends were well into the hard life of
    drugs and alcohol – and theft in order to support their habits – when, on the
    night in question, they decided to rob Mr. Smith of a sizeable amount of drugs
    which they understood he had in his apartment.  The robbery went bad and in the
    course of the confrontation the appellant stabbed Mr. Smith 13 to 18 times.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three of the knife wounds were to Mr. Smith’s head (one beside his right
    eye, another through the top of his ear to his scalp).  Four deep wounds (up to
    6 cm.) were to the back, three of which were up to 6 cm. deep.  One of the
    wounds to the back caused Mr. Smith’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The robbery had been planned earlier in the evening by a group of people
    gathered at another person’s apartment in the absence of the appellant.  The
    appellant initially refused to participate, but was later recruited.  His
    girlfriend testified that, prior to the group leaving for the robbery, she had
    checked the appellant for weapons, since she did not want him to get into
    trouble.  He was nevertheless able to leave armed with a knife that he had
    obtained during an earlier break and enter that same evening.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the stabbing, the appellant and two others fled Mr. Smith’s
    apartment and returned to the party at the friend’s home.  The appellant later
    disposed of the knife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was ample evidence that the appellant and his friends had been
    consuming significant amounts of alcohol and drugs throughout the evening,
    although the precise amount of the appellant’s consumption was never clearly
    established.  The appellant did not give evidence, but his male friends
    testified that they were all intoxicated and high that night.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    “Mr. Big” Operation</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of its investigation, the police launched a “Mr. Big”
    operation in which an undercover police officer posed as an underworld
    operative who could facilitate a meeting with “Mr. Big”, a major organized
    crime player (played by another undercover officer), and help him to work his
    way into his organization. The undercover officers asked the appellant to be
    completely honest about his past.  They offered to help make the charges go
    away if the appellant provided details of what happened, but insisted that they
    had to know “100%” of what happened so that they would know what it was they
    had to deal with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After initially insisting that he had remained in the car at the time of
    the incident, the appellant ultimately responded to these blandishments by
    providing a full and damning confession.  He explained that when they got to
    the door of Mr. Smith’s apartment and asked for weed, Mr. Smith refused, fought
    back, and tried to push the door closed.  Since no one else stepped up, the
    appellant kicked in the door, put a gun or a gun replica to the victim’s head,
    and in the ensuing exchange – “when I started doing what I had to do” (as he
    said in his confession) – stabbed Mr. Smith a number of times.  The confession
    was admitted without objection.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US><u>Grounds 2 and 3</u></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call upon the Crown to respond to the second and third
    grounds of appeal raised by the appellant.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>“Mild”
    vs. “Advanced” Intoxication</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge did not use the terms “mild” and “advanced” to
    distinguish between levels of impairment or intoxication and the different
    effects different levels might have on the appellant’s state of mind for
    murder, it was not essential that he use such a formulaic approach.  The trial
    judge gave the following instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence in this case raised the issue that Mr.
    Szanyi may have lacked the necessary intent due to his state of impairment or
    intoxication caused by the ingestion of alcohol and drugs he consumed at
    Sawyer’s place before the robbery.  Let me tell you that while intoxication is
    self-induced and <i>exists in varying degrees</i>, it can cause a person to cast
    off restraint and act in a manner that he would not act in while sober.  That
    is no excuse for committing the offence if <i>he had the state of mind required</i>. 
    You are to examine the reliable evidence dealing with his consumption that
    evening.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Consider the length of time over which the
    consumption or ingestion took place and all the other evidence that relates to
    his state of mind at the time the offence was committed.  Consider what he did,
    what he did not do, and what he said or did not say.  In doing so, you are to
    look at Derek Szanyi’s words and conduct before, during and after.  <i>This
    will help you to determine the state of mind.  In spite of his ingestion of
    drugs and alcohol, he acknowledges having the state of mind to commit the
    robbery.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Did he have the state of mind to commit the murder?
    It is for  you to use  your common sense.  You should ask yourself, did Mr.
    Szanyi act instinctively in the sudden excitement of the moment? Was he
    thinking about the consequences?  <i>Did he  intend to cause bodily harm to Mr.
    Smith that he knew was likely to kill Smith, was he reckless as to whether or
    not Mr. Smith might die?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>There is some evidence as to the effects of
    certain drugs and alcohol on the mind and in this case, you must take into
    consideration in determining the accused’s state of mind</i>, remembering all
    the while the purpose of the trip to Smith’s apartment, and the effect that
    alcohol had or did not have on the accused.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Did it just affect
    his inhibitions, or was the effect of the drugs and alcohol such as to impact
    upon his forming the necessary intent</i>?  You must consider all of the
    evidence on that point and be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We were quite satisfied that the foregoing instruction sufficiently
    brought home to the jury the need to distinguish between milder and more
    advanced forms of intoxication for purposes of determining the appellant’s
    state of mind.  Indeed, as the Crown points out, the last portion of the charge
    cited above in italics was considerably more favourable to the defence than the
    appellant was entitled to expect: “the effect of the drugs and alcohol” must be
    more than simply “<i>to impact</i> upon [the appellant’s] forming the necessary
    intent”; the effect must <i>lead him not to form the specific intent</i> for
    murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Failure
    to Instruct on Reasonable Doubt When Responding to the Jury’s Question
    Regarding the Decision Tree</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor would we give effect to the argument that the trial judge erred by
    failing to incorporate a reasonable doubt instruction into his response to the
    jury’s clarification question regarding the decision tree for second degree
    murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After deliberating for some time, the jury asked the following question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Can you please clarify
    the #2 position of the decision tree.  A few of us believe we (<i>sic</i>) instructed
    two different ways.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second branch of the decision tree dealt with the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for murder in s. 229(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46<i> </i>– did the appellant mean to cause bodily harm that he knew
    was likely to cause death, and, if so, was he reckless whether death ensued or
    not?  The question did not address the burden of proof, and the trial judge’s
    answer was responsive to the question put to him.  While it may have been
    preferable had he tacked on the usual reminder that they must be satisfied on
    these matters beyond a reasonable doubt, it is clear, on reading the charge as
    a whole, that the jury was amply and adequately instructed on the need to be
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements of the offence charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the two issues upon which we heard full argument.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Ground
    1</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant first contends that the trial judge erred by not
    specifically linking the need for the jury to consider the evidence of impairment
    and intoxication with its consideration of the “common sense” instruction.  I
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the portion of his charge dealing with the “recklessness” aspect of
    the second branch of the test for <i>mens rea</i> under s. 229(a)(ii), the
    trial judge instructed the jurors that they may draw the common sense inference
    from the probable consequences of a person’s actions that the person usually
    intends or means to cause those consequences.  This is what he told them (some
    of this is cited above, but is repeated here for context and convenience):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is worth noting that when considering the term
    reckless, the box in the middle, number two<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    considering that term of reckless, whether Mr. Smith died or not, you can
    consider the likelihood that Mr. Smith could die from the injuries he
    sustained, but that Szanyi went ahead anyway and took that chance.  <i>You may
    conclude, as a matter of common sense, that if a person does something that has
    predictable consequences, that person usually intends or means to cause those
    consequences.  But it is simply one way</i> for you to determine a person’s
    actual state of mind.  What he actually meant to do is a conclusion that you
    may only reach, however, after considering all of the evidence.  <i>It is not a
    conclusion you must reach</i>, it is for you to decide whether you reach that
    conclusion in this case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The defence in this case raised the issue that
    Mr. Szanyi may have lacked the necessary intent due to his state of impairment
    or intoxication caused by the ingestion of alcohol and drugs</i> he consumed at
    Sawyer’s place before the robbery.  Let me tell you that while intoxication is
    self-induced and exists in varying degrees, it can cause a person to cast off
    restraint and act in a manner that he would not act in while sober.  That is no
    excuse for committing the offence if he had the state of mind required.  You
    are to examine the reliable evidence dealing with his consumption that evening.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Consider the length of time over which the

    what he did not do, and what he said or did not say.  In doing so, you are to
    look at Derek Szanyi’s words and conduct before, during and after.  This will
    help you to determine the state of mind.  In spite of his ingestion of drugs
    and alcohol, he acknowledges having the state of mind to commit the robbery.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Did he have the state of mind to commit the murder? <i>It is for  you to use  your common sense.</i>  You should ask yourself, did
    Mr. Szanyi act instinctively in the sudden excitement of the moment? <i>Was he
    thinking about the consequences</i>?  <i>Did he  intend to cause bodily harm to
    Mr. Smith that he knew was likely to kill Smith, was he reckless as to whether
    or not Mr. Smith might die?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>There is some evidence as to the effects of

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obligation of a trial judge when instructing the jury is to link the
    common sense inference to the evidence of impairment and intoxication.  The
    trial judge must do this in a way that ensures the jurors understand (a) that
    they are not bound to draw the inference, (b) that the inference may only be
    drawn after a consideration of all the evidence, including the evidence of
    intoxication, and (c) that the inference cannot be applied if the jury is left
    with a reasonable doubt about the accused’s intention: <i>R. v. Seymour</i> [1996] 2 S.C.R. 252, at paras. 19-23; <i>R v. Daley</i> [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, no formulaic wording is necessary to accomplish that purpose. 
    As Bastarache J. noted for the majority in <i>Daley</i>, at para. 53:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While I agree that the
    inquiry under s. 229(a)(ii) is whether the accused possessed the ability to
    foresee the consequences of his action and the main determination in cases
    involving a defence of intoxication to a second degree murder charge will be
    whether the accused’s degree of intoxication affected this ability, and that it
    is very important for the jury to understand this, <i>I do not think this
    Court’s jurisprudence goes so far [as] to require that a particular phrase
    expressly making this link be included in the charge, the absence of which
    leads to reversible error.  As discussed above, appellate courts must consider
    whether the charge, as a whole, conveyed the necessary instruction to the jury,
    not whether particular words or a particular sequence was followed</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, I do not think there can be any doubt that the charge read as a
    whole – and particularly the passage cited in para. 21 above with respect to
    the common sense inference and the defence of intoxication – conveyed to the
    jury the necessary link between drawing that inference and not doing so without
    considering the evidence of intoxication.  The common sense inference
    instruction is given.  In the next three sentences the jurors are told that
    they are not required to draw the inference, that it is only one way of
    determining a person’s state of mind, and that they must only draw the
    inference after considering all the evidence (impairment and intoxication are
    not excluded).  Then, in the <i>next</i> paragraph of the instructions – <i>commencing
    only six lines after the common sense instruction is given</i> – the trial
    judge tells the jurors about “[t]he defence … that Mr. Szanyi may have lacked
    the necessary intent due to his state of impairment or intoxication.”  All of
    this is prefaced by establishing the setting for this line of analysis:
    consideration of the term recklessness and “the likelihood that Mr. Smith could
    die from the injuries he sustained but that [Mr.] Szanyi went ahead anyway and
    took that chance.”  Finally, after some further instructions on determining the
    appellant’s state of mind for murder, including a further reference to the
    issue of foreseeability of consequences and the effects of alcohol and drugs on
    his state of mind, the trial judge reminded the jury again of the Crown’s
    obligation to prove the appellant’s intent  for murder beyond a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Would it have been preferable for the trial judge to have imported the
    magic words “including the evidence of impairment or intoxication” into the charge
    after telling the jurors that the common sense inference was only to be drawn
    “after considering all of the evidence”?  Probably.  But I am satisfied that
    the charge as a whole, and in particular the passage outlined above, conveyed
    the necessary instruction to the jurors that they had to make the link between
    the drawing of the inference and the evidence of impairment or intoxication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Ground
    4</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More troubling is the trial judge’s failure to give the jury the
    standard limiting instruction concerning the impermissible use of bad character
    evidence for propensity reasoning, in this case, bad character evidence arising
    from the Mr. Big operation.  The jury heard considerable evidence about the
    appellant’s criminal record, his association with disreputable characters, his
    prior bad conduct, and his abuse of illicit drugs.  In the end, however, I am
    satisfied that the trial judge committed no reversible error in his charge on
    this issue, having regard to a number of factors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, all of the Mr. Big evidence was led by the Crown without
    objection from the defence, as part of its case, because defence counsel had
    indicated to the court and to the Crown that the appellant would be testifying.
     From the Crown’s perspective, the essential part of the Mr. Big evidence was
    the inculpatory confession ultimately provided by the appellant to the
    undercover police officers.  This confession also went in without objection and
    – as Mr. Lepofsky put it during argument – was “somewhat of a body blow” to the
    defence.  It seems clear that the defence’s willingness to have all of the Mr.
    Big evidence on the record was attributable to its tactical decision to use
    that evidence as perhaps its only realistic hope of overcoming the damaging
    nature of the confession.  Quite possibly, the ultimate decision by the
    appellant not to testify was based on the premise that it was not going to get
    any better for him if he did, and that the Crown’s case had already painted the
    evidentiary picture for the jury as well as it could be done from the defence
    perspective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings me to the second, and important, factor leading to the
    conclusion that in the end the trial judge committed no reversible error in
    this regard.  The defence made a tactical decision – quite understandable in
    the circumstances – to rely upon the bad character evidence arising from the
    Mr. Big operation in support of its position that the confession was mere
    “puffery” made by a gullible young man who wanted to ingratiate himself with
    criminal elements and whose criminal antecedents made him an easy prey for such
    a sting.  While I think the admissibility of some of the Mr. Big evidence might
    well have been a matter of debate – particularly the appellant’s boast that he
    had previously stabbed a friend in the neck because he had been drinking and
    the friend was making a mess and wouldn’t stop – the defence can hardly
    complain when it (a) failed to object to the admissibility of the evidence and
    (b) sought to utilize the bad character evidence for its own permitted
    propensity purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his closing submissions, defence counsel urged the jury to consider
    the context in which the appellant’s statements – including, of course, the
    confession – were made to the undercover officers during the Mr. Big sting:
    they amounted to the braggadocio of a young man with a coloured past seeking to
    find favour with Mr. Big and must be “viewed through that prism.”  Defence
    counsel told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The undercover officers] had a purpose, that is to
    exploit the greed of their target in order to ultimately get him to say
    something about what had happened at 206, and ultimately, it succeeded.  And
    the fact that the greed was <i>motivated by some desire to become involved in a
    criminal organization</i>, in my respectful submission, is again, not a piece
    of evidence that ought to assist you one way or the other in evaluating my
    client.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plan was targeted, the investigation was
    targeted in such a way as to <i>exploit the type of person that they believed
    Mr. Szanyi was, somebody who was familiar with what went on on the streets</i> and somebody who did not have money . …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But what’s important for you to remember, in my
    respectful submission, is [the undercover officer’s] concession under
    cross-examination that oftentimes, oftentimes when he’s working in an
    undercover capacity, he is lied to.  And as I understand his explanation for
    that proposition, it’s because at least some of what goes on on the street <i>involving
    people who are involved in this type of activity, </i>is based on<i> bragging
    or puffery, </i>is based on deception, is based on you wanting others to
    believe that you’re tougher, or bigger, or smarter, or richer or more clever
    when it comes to dealing drugs or whatever than you really are<i>.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And so, when you
    consider everything that has been reported or recorded <i>in terms of what my
    client is alleged to have said</i>, I ask you to consider it carefully, don’t
    just consider the words, or what you suspect are their meaning but consider the
    context in which they’re being spoken, and whether or not they are really as
    reliable as they would be if they were spoken directly out of the witness box,
    for instance; in other words, <i>was there puffery or bragging going on</i>? 
    Was there deception involved?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the trial judge did, in fact, tell the jurors to “ignore” the
    appellant’s past.  He was alerted to the issue by Crown counsel during the
    pre-charge conference.  Crown counsel referred the trial judge to the fact
    there had been a number of conversations between the appellant and the
    undercover officers regarding the appellant’s criminal history, and reminded
    the trial judge that “the jury [had] heard quite a lot of nasty stuff about Mr.
    Szanyi.”  The trial judge acknowledged this, and agreed to incorporate an instruction
    into the charge, indicating that he would “just say that the fact that he may
    have had a youth record or anything else doesn’t matter, discharge it from you
    mind and just deal with the facts in this case alone, period.”  The Crown
    agreed and defence counsel made no objection or comment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the charge, the trial judge did more or less what he had said he
    would do.  He told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While you are considering the evidence, you are not
    to take into account, in looking at this charge, the fact that Szanyi has spent
    considerable time in custody and that he is likely to have committed murder.  <i>Ignore
    his past</i>, and decide on the facts in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that they were
    not to draw any adverse inference from a person’s criminal record, beyond
    assessing their testimonial credibility, and, in keeping with the foregoing
    approach, when it came to his review of the evidence, the trial judge
    completely played down the Mr. Big evidence.  With respect to that evidence, he
    said only the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidence of the two
    police officers in the Mr. Big play, you have.  I am not going to review that
    with you.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Lepofsky submits, this instruction may have been overly
    favourable to the appellant because it made no mention of the appellant’s
    damning admissions to the undercover officers respecting the killing, nor did
    it list the extensive evidence corroborating the confession.   After both
    counsel had heard how the trial judge dealt with the Mr. Big evidence, only the
    Crown objected.  The Crown objected because the trial judge had not reviewed
    the confession, as it “was such a salient part of [the] case.”  It is
    reasonable to infer that defence counsel did not object because he was quite
    content with the manner in which the trial judge dealt with that evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Gourlay argues, nonetheless, that the bad character evidence was
    highly prejudicial, as was the portion of the instruction cited above that the
    jurors were not to take into account “that [the appellant] is likely to have
    committed murder.”  While he acknowledges that the evidence of the claimed extrinsic
    misconduct was relevant and probative to the credibility of the admissions in
    question, he submits that the trial judge was obliged to instruct the jurors on
    the proper use of this highly prejudicial evidence in a way that made it clear
    they were not to engage in the sort of propensity reasoning that is prohibited,
    i.e., that trial judge was required to tell the jurors they were forbidden from
    concluding that because the appellant was a person of bad character who had
    committed other crimes he was therefore a person with a propensity to commit
    further crimes, and this crime in particular: see <i>R v. Arcangioli</i>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at paras. 26 and 34; <i>R v. Handy</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    908, at para. 72 .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, however, I am not persuaded that the trial judge committed reversible error in failing to give the standard &ldquo;propensity&rdquo; charge.  I say this for a number of reasons.  First, as cited above, he clearly and specifically instructed the jurors to &ldquo;ignore [the appellant&rsquo;s] past and decide on the facts of this case.&rdquo;  Secondly, he did not review the evidence of the two police officers regarding &ldquo;the Mr. Big play&rdquo;, thus minimizing the risk of highlighting the bad character evidence in the eyes of the jury.  Thirdly, the Crown did not seek to rely on the bad character evidence or on the Mr. Big evidence in any way, except for the confession to this murder.  Lastly, the defence did.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence adopted the deliberate and understandable tactic of relying upon the appellant&rsquo;s admissions about his active criminal past in order to support his position that he was &ldquo;the type of person&rdquo; whose antecedents led him to be easily lured into a criminal organization and who would engage in &ldquo;puffery and bragging&rdquo; about his past &ndash; including confessing to the killing of Billy Smith &ndash; in order to become a part of such an organization, thus impugning the reliability of that confession.  On these facts, it cannot be said that the Crown was trying to ease its burden by stigmatizing the appellant as a bad person: <i>Handy</i>, at para. 72. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the very unusual circumstances of this case, therefore, the trial
    judge was justified in leaving the bad character instruction as he did,
    downplaying the Mr. Big evidence, and leaving the jury to deal with the
    confession and to roll with the defence submissions relating to it, as he did. 
    I do not think he committed reversible error in doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, if the trial judge did err in failing to give the
    standard limiting instruction, I am satisfied – for the same reasons that lead
    me to conclude he need not have given the instruction – that the error
    occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the very unusual
    circumstances of this case: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 686(1)(b)(iii).  </p>
