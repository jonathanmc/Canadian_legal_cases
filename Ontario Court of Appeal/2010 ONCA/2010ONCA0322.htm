  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge's central finding is set out at para.
    39 of his reasons. He said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I find as a fact
    based on all of the evidence that the debt obligation created by the directors
    of Lisgar was payable within a reasonable period of time after a demand for
    payment was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on to hold that an unequivocal
    demand for payment was made on November 14, 2007 and that a reasonable period
    of time had therefore elapsed. He ordered repayment of the shareholder's loan
    together with pre-judgment interest from May 14, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject the appellant's submission that the trial
    judge made errors of fact and law in making the finding set out at para. 39. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, we are not satisfied that the trial
    judge's conclusion is either unreasonable or inconsistent with the statement at
    para. 30 of his reasons that the directors intended to pay out all the
    shareholders’ accounts at an unspecified time in the future when they thought
    it was financially prudent to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The directors' intentions are not determinative of the
    terms of the loan. In our view, the trial judge's finding that the loan was
    payable within a reasonable period of time following a demand is rooted in his
    assessment of a number of factors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those factors include the expressed intentions of the
    directors over the period of years prior to the falling out in 2006. However,
    significantly, they also include the acknowledgement signed by Mr. Zenker and
    the financial statements issued soon after the transactions were finalized,
    both of which indicated there were no repayment terms attached to the loan; the
    hybrid character of the loan in the sense that it had features resembling both
    an investment and a debt; and the history of periodic repayment by the
    corporation of similar loans in the past. The trial judge was satisfied that
    all of the directors expected that the financial statements would be presented
    to and relied upon by third parties. Notably, neither the acknowledgment nor
    the financial statements set out any restrictions on the obligation to make
    repayments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the finding made by the trial judge at
    para. 39 of his reasons is a finding of fact that was available on the evidence
    that was before him. We see no basis for holding that it was inconsistent with
    his finding at para 30. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 40 of his reasons, the trial judge said that
    his finding of fact concerning the terms of the loan was “also consistent with
    jurisprudence which holds that a loan with no fixed term is payable within a
    reasonable time after a demand is made.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not read the decisions the trial judge referred
    to as holding that, in the absence of specific terms of repayment, a term must
    necessarily be implied that a loan is payable within a reasonable time
    following a demand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do we read the reasons of Blair J. in <i>Naneff v. Concrete Holdings Inc.</i>, [1993]
    O.J. No. 1756, at paras. 135-6 and 139, varied on other grounds [1995] O.J.
    1377 (C.A.), as holding that, when an estate freeze is involved, a
    shareholder’s loan to a corporation from a non-controlling shareholder must, in
    the absence of specific terms of repayment, be interpreted as being payable
    when the directors consider repayment financially prudent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather, the question of what are the applicable terms
    for repayment of the loan is a matter to be determined having regard to the
    other terms of the loan and the overall factual context in which the loan was
    made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge took the relevant circumstances
    into consideration. Although he may have overstated the effect of the decisions
    he referred to at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 40 of his <span class=GramE>reasons,
    that</span> does not undermine his finding of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call on the respondent to address the
    appellant's submission concerning <i>res
    judicata</i>, issue estoppel or abuse of process. The issues before Wilton-Siegel
    J. related to whether the appellant corporation should be entitled to continue
    or be wound up. As such, they were of a fundamentally different character than
    the claim advanced in this case. Moreover, to the extent that the facts related
    to the loans in issue in this case played any role in the earlier proceeding,
    that role can only be characterized as miniscule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the cross-appeal, the trial judge found that
    an unequivocal demand for payment of the loans in issue was made on November
    14, 2007. The appellant by cross-appeal has not demonstrated any error in that
    finding. The question of the date from which pre-judgment interest runs is a
    matter within the discretion of the trial judge. We see no basis to interfere
    in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cross-appeal is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the appeal are to the respondent on a partial
    indemnity scale fixed at $22,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. as
    agreed upon by the parties. There will be no order as to costs of the
    cross-appeal.</p>
