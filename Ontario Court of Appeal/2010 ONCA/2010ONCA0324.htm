    Review Board (the “Board”), continuing his conditional discharge and refusing
    to grant him an absolute discharge.  The
    appellant’s appeal from the Board’s 2009 disposition initially came before this
    court after the Board issued its 2010 disposition.  The parties agreed to expedite this appeal from
    the Board’s 2010 disposition.</span></p>

    Board or its predecessor for almost 30 years.  The index offences, attempted murder and possession of a prohibited
    weapon, committed when the appellant was 27 years old, were very serious.  The appellant was being treated by a
    physician for his mental problems with megavitamins.  The appellant became convinced that the
    megavitamins were toxic and went to the doctor’s office with a shotgun.  He entered the office and levelled the gun in
    the direction of the doctor, who ducked.  The appellant fired the weapon narrowly, missing a young girl who was
    seated in the doctor’s office.  The
    appellant was found ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ (a verdict now legally
    known as ‘not criminally responsible’) and was diagnosed with paranoid
    schizophrenia.</span></p>

    offenses, he has no other involvement with the criminal justice system and has
    committed no further criminal or violent acts.  From 1981 until 2008, the appellant was detained in psychiatric
    facilities, except for three periods of community living at the discretion of
    the treating hospital.  He was subject to
    a detention order until January 2008, when the Board granted him a conditional
    discharge.</span></p>

    whether the appellant met the criteria for a CTO. Dr. Ellis testified that, if
    a CTO could be issued, and if the appellant could be integrated into the local
    non-forensic case management system, the appellant’s treatment team would be
    open to asking the Board to replace its current disposition with an absolute
    discharge on the ground that the appellant could be managed with the CTO.  Dr. Ellis also indicated that, while he was
    concerned that the appellant might not continue his medication if granted an
    absolute discharge with nothing else in place, it was also his opinion that the
    appellant does respond to the requirements of legal orders.  According to Dr. Ellis, this meant that if a
    CTO were available, it would be difficult to maintain the proposition that the
    appellant continued to pose a significant risk to the public.</span></p>

    mental disorder with a comprehensive plan of community-based treatment or care

    facility. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a purpose is to
    provide such a plan for a person who, as a result of his or her serious mental
    disorder, experiences this pattern: The person is admitted to a psychiatric
    facility where his or her condition is usually stabilized; after being released
    from the facility, the person often stops the treatment or care and
    supervision; the person’s condition changes and, as a result, the person must
    be re-admitted to a psychiatric facility. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The pivotal issue is whether the appellant was a “patient” in
    a psychiatric facility during the three-year period preceding the order.  Section 1(1) of the Act defines “out-patient”
    and “patient” as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“out-patient” means a person who is registered in a psychiatric
    facility for observation or treatment or both, but who is not admitted as a
    patient and is not the subject of an application for assessment;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Crown submits that, as s. 39.1 provides that a person who
    is subject to a CTO may apply to the Consent and Capacity Board for a
    determination of whether or not the criteria for issuing or renewing a CTO set
    out in subsection 33.1 (4) are <span class=GramE>met,</span> this court is
    without jurisdiction to determine the validity of the order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I disagree with the contention that it is not open to this
    court to rule on the validity of the CTO.  While s. 39.1 clearly grants jurisdiction to the
    Consent and Capacity Board to determine this issue at the request of the person
    subject to a CTO, I see nothing in the language of the Act that would preclude this
    court from determining the legal question arising on this appeal, which has a
    direct bearing upon the legal rights of the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, I turn to the issue of whether the appellant
    meets the criteria for a CTO. The Crown submits that as the appellant was
    living in the community since May 2006, he had not been a patient in a
    psychiatric facility during the three-year period immediately before the CTO
    was issued and that therefore, he does not meet the requirement specified by s.
    33.1(4)(a)(i) of the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, this argument cannot be accepted.  The appellant was subject to a detention order
    until he was granted a conditional discharge in January 2008.  He was living in the community since May 2006
    but remained bound by the terms of his detention order, which granted his
    treatment team the discretion to allow him to live in the community. Thus, he
    could be returned to the hospital at any time and he remained subject to the
    discretion and control of his treatment team at all times.  By virtue of the legal character of the
    disposition that governed the appellant and ordered that he be detained in a
    psychiatric institution, subject only to the discretion of his treatment team,
    he remained a patient under the Act, even though the treatment team allowed him
    to live temporarily in the community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The situation here is closely analogous to the one that arose
    in <i>Lavallie v. Kingston Psychiatric
    Hospital</i> (2000), 136 O.A.C. 334 (C.A.).  In that case, the central question concerned the validity of a
    certificate of incapacity issued pursuant to s. 54 of the Act, which grants an
    attending physician the authority to issue such a certificate for a “patient”.  The appellant had been granted regular leaves
    of absence from the hospital. He argued that, as he did not remain in the
    hospital, he was no longer a “patient” and, consequently, that the certificate
    of incapacity was therefore a nullity.  This
    court held that the definition of “patient” should be approached in a flexible
    and purposive manner, and that the fact that the appellant had been on a leave
    of absence did not invalidate the certificate of incapacity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would apply the same purposive interpretation of the term
    “patient” to the case at bar and hold that, even though the appellant had been
    permitted to live in the community, this did not strip him of the “patient”
    designation, especially given the fact that he remained subject to a detention
    order until January, 2008 when he was granted a conditional discharge.  As the present case can be decided on that
    basis, I leave the resolution of the question of the status of an individual
    who is subject to a conditional discharge for another day. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, I do not accept the submission that the CTO is
    of questionable legal validity.  It
    follows, in my view, that the fresh evidence meets all four branches of the <i>Palmer</i> test.  The Crown has conceded the due diligence and
    credibility branches.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The evidence is relevant to the central issue before the
    Board, namely, the risk to the public arising from the need to ensure that the
    appellant continues to take his medication. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The evidence also could have affected the result of the disposition.  As I read the record before the Board and the
    reasons underpinning its decision, it is clear that the justification for denying
    the appellant an absolute discharge rested upon the concern that, absent a
    legal compulsion requiring him to do so, he would not take his medication and
    that he was not integrated with the non-forensic case management system.  The appellant has demonstrated a record of
    consistent compliance for the past several years.  Moreover, the CTO implements a legal mechanism
    that requires the appellant to continue taking his medication.   Dr.
    Ellis is satisfied that the appellant will adhere to the CTO.  The fresh evidence adds the vital link missing
    at the time of the hearing. The fresh evidence also indicates that the
    appellant has been linked with the community mental health care network to the
    satisfaction of his treating physician.   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I do not agree that the appropriate disposition is to return
    the matter to the Board for further consideration, as it is my view that the
    only reasonable outcome in light of the fresh evidence is to grant the
    appellant an absolute discharge.</span></p>
