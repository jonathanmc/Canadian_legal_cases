  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The background facts to the offences are as
    follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accused acted as a debt-enforcer for a pawnshop
    owner, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span>, in Ottawa.  Two individuals, Mr. Robb and Ms. Bertrand,
    had taken some of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte’s</span> counterfeit money
    and used it in exchange for payment in real currency and to acquire drugs.  In order to explain what had happened to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Piamonte’s</span> money, they concocted a story that the police
    had arrested Mr. Robb and seized the money.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> did not believe this story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>May 23, 2004, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> went, along with Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Tremblay, to Mr. Robb and Ms. Bertrand’s
    apartment to find out where his money was.  Mr. Robb stuck to his story about the arrest.  When the two were separated, Ms. Bertrand
    admitted that the story was concocted, and returned the balance of the money
    that she still had.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> arrived later in the afternoon to aid as a
    debt-enforcer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They returned to the pawnshop together, ostensibly to
    move a television.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> confronted Mr. Robb with the money given to him by
    Ms. Bertrand.  He said he wanted the rest
    of his money back.  A sawed-off shotgun
    was produced by Mr. Schmidt.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> was acquitted by the jury of uttering death
    threats or possessing the shotgun, but the sentencing judge found that he was
    flicking a knife in and out, at the pawnshop at the same time that they were
    demanding money from Mr. Robb.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They drove back to Mr. Robb’s apartment in Mr.
    Robb’s car to get the money.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> demanded money for himself for his trouble.  He also drove the car for some of the
    distance; Mr. Schmidt drove part of the way.  Mr. Robb did not believe he had any choice but to get in the car and
    accompany them to his residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When they arrived at the residence, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> accompanied Mr. Robb into the home, leaving Mr.
    Schmidt in the car.  The sentencing judge
    found as a fact that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>… </b>[A]t
    this point, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> said that Mr. Robb owed
    money to very dangerous men and that if he did not pay it, even if it took time,
    a month or two in time, and no matter where Mr. Robb was, they would get
    him.  At this point, Mrs. Robb asked if
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> was one of the men to whom Mr. Robb
    owed money, and Mr. Robb acknowledged that he was.  Mrs. Robb went immediately to the telephone
    to call the police and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> quickly left the
    residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As they drove away from the residence, either Mr.
    Schmidt or <span class=SpellE>Mr.Choquette</span>, with the other’s knowledge,
    threw the sawed-off rifle into a ditch.  It
    was subsequently found unloaded by the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When contacted by police, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> refused to return to Ottawa and basically told them to catch him if they could.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The issue of parity </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parity principle does not require that the
    sentences given to persons who commit the same crime be the same; the parity
    principle requires that the differences be understandable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> submits that
    the sentence he received offends the parity principle when compared to the
    sentence given to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span>, the moving force
    behind the events. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> pled guilty
    before a different judge to four groups of offences, including the group
    relating to this event.  The group
    related to this event were: one count of careless storage of ammunition; one
    count of unlawful confinement; one count of uttering threats and one count of
    breach of recognizance of bail.  For
    these offences, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> received an 8-month
    conditional sentence concurrent on each count to each other but consecutive to
    sentences for drug and counterfeit-related offences, which resulted in a global
    conditional sentence of two years less a day.  The terms of the conditional sentence included
    house arrest and that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> provide the day to
    day care for his mother who was stricken with Alzheimer’s.  Following the completion of his sentence he
    was to be on probation for a period of three years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three distinguishing features noted by the sentencing
    judge on the parity issue were that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> had
    no prior criminal record and was 50 years old when he committed the crimes; he
    pled guilty immediately following his preliminary inquiry; and he had a drug
    problem from which he had rehabilitated himself at the time of sentencing.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> continued to be in the care of a psychiatrist for depression.  He was fortunate in that he had a very good
    family network to support him in the community.  The Crown and the defence agreed that
    notwithstanding his crime spree, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> did not
    pose any danger to the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span>,
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> was considerably younger, being 38 years
    old at the time of the offences, and he had a fairly extensive criminal record
    going back to 1991.  The offences include
    possession of stolen property (1991, 1994), breaking and entering and theft,
    unlawful possession of explosive (1991), assault (1992, 2001, 2007),
    trafficking in narcotics (1993), impaired driving (2000), driving while
    disqualified (2002, 2006), several firearm offences in 2005 and numerous
    failures to appear and obstructions of peace officers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> had 48
    prior convictions, the sentences he received were in the 30 to 90-day range
    with the exception of his sentence in August 2005, for “the North Bay charges”
    relating to the firearm offences.  For
    these offences he received a sentence of two years in addition to fifteen
    months of pre-sentence custody, which the sentencing judge found, was in effect
    a sentence of 4.5 years.  The sentencing
    judge observed that while Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> was not
    considered a danger to society, the same could not be said of Mr. Schmidt or
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge noted that the fact Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> was addicted to cocaine at the time of the
    offences was a mitigating factor, “in the sense that he was engaging in
    criminal activity, in part to feed his drug habit.”  However, the sentencing judge also observed
    that although incarcerated at <span class=SpellE>Joyceville</span> Institution
    since August 17, 2005, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> only started an
    addiction program in August 2006, shortly before his sentencing on October 25,
    2006.  Pre-trial custody was not a factor
    as at the time Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> was serving a sentence
    for an unrelated crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the parity principle, the court must
    also take into consideration the sentence for Mr. Schmidt who was tried with
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> for these offences.  Mr. Schmidt received a sentence of 6.5 years
    but he was convicted of possession of a sawed-off rifle for the purpose of
    committing an offence.  This carried a
    four year minimum sentence.  In addition
    he was convicted of possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  He, too, had a long criminal record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Duty counsel
    points out that the jury specifically acquitted Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> of any firearm offence.  In addition, as
    indicated, he was not the moving force behind the events; that was Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Piamonte</span>.  When the
    victim was taken to his home in the hope of obtaining the money and Mrs. Robb
    said she was calling the police, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette</span> immediately abandoned the enterprise and fled.  Following his conviction, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> expressed remorse for his actions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was alive to the parity principle
    and specifically addressed it in her reasons. As indicated above, the
    sentencing judge explained the differences between Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte’s</span> situation and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Choquette’s</span> and referenced the
    former’s guilty plea, lack of prior record, and rehabilitation from drugs.  Furthermore, because Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> received an exceptionally lenient sentence due to his particular circumstances,
    the sentencing judge was not obliged to do the same with Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span>.  The
    sentencing judge committed no error in principle in sentencing Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Choquette</span> and the difference in the sentences he imposed is
    understandable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted,
    I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>

  <p class=Party><b>Armstrong J.A. (Dissenting):</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have read the reasons for judgment of my colleague,
    Weiler J.A.  I am unable to agree with
    her conclusion.  I would allow the appeal
    and reduce the sentence for extortion to three years in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the sentencing judge misapplied the
    parity principle.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Piamonte</span>, who was found by the sentencing judge to be the
    leader of the enterprise, received an eight month conditional sentence for his
    involvement.  The appellant was found not
    guilty of the firearms offences.  He
    abandoned his criminal conduct as soon as the mother of Mr. Robb called the
    police.  The appellant received a
    penitentiary term of four years.  There
    is, in my view, a complete disconnect between the two sentences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There is no
    doubt that there are a number of factors, which distinguish the positions of
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Piamonte</span> and the appellant.  These factors are reviewed by my
    colleague.  I need not revisit them.  I simply observe that none of the
    distinguishing factors, taken separately or together, <span class=GramE>lead</span> me to the view that there should be such a disparity in sentences for these two
    individuals.    </p>
