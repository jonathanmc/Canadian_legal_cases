  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the Order of Herold J. dated November 9, 2009
    dismissing the appellant husband’s motion to vary the support order of Smith J.
    dated December 1, 1998.  The basis of the motion judge’s decision was his
    finding that there had been no material change in circumstances that would
    justify elimination or reduction of the spousal support he has been paying to
    the respondent wife for 11 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties married in 1974 and separated in 1996.  In a final judgment
    dated December 1, 1998, which flowed from Minutes of Settlement, the husband
    was ordered to pay spousal support of $3200 per month on a non-time limited
    basis and child support for the two children of the marriage of $811 per
    month.  The child support payments were terminated on consent in 2003 when the
    children were no longer dependent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the motion judge erred by failing to
    consider the disparity in accumulated assets as a relevant factor and
    improperly minimizing recent developments in the corporation co-owned by the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  Although the respondent’s financial situation has improved
    in the years since separation, so has the appellant’s.  The reality is that the
    respondent was a stay at home mother throughout the long marriage, did not
    complete high school, has not worked since 1994, and in the words of the motion
    judge “still is today emotionally and psychologically fragile.”  In short, on
    the respondent’s side of the coin, there is still a demonstrated need for
    financial support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the husband’s side of the coin, he is a successful businessman
    operating a successful business.  He has had a steady income throughout his
    life.  His sworn financial statement from September 1, 2009 shows a gross
    monthly income and benefits of $9282.57 which equates to a gross annual income
    of $111,390.84.  He is not required to pay support for his children.  Moreover,
    the spousal support has not increased since 1998 and the appellant has been
    able to deduct it on his tax returns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, we agree with the motion judge’s finding that
    the respondent “is not in a position at this time to become financially
    self-sufficient” and with his conclusion that the appellant “has not
    demonstrated a material change in circumstances which would justify a variation
    of the consent order.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to her costs of the
    appeal fixed at $9000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
