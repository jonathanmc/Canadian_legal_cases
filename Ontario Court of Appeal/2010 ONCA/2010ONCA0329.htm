  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of trafficking in crack
    cocaine in a hand-to-hand transaction with an undercover officer. The appellant
    was arrested within 60 seconds of the take-down signal being given by the
    officer to the rest of the surveillance team. When the appellant was arrested,
    he was searched but he did not have on him the marked $20 <span class=GramE>bill</span> the officer claimed that he used to pay for the crack, nor did he have the
    baggy with the chunk of crack that the officer said the appellant had and from
    which he had broken off the piece that he sold to the undercover officer. The
    arresting officers then searched the area but they still did not find the buy
    money or the drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had been under observation by one or more
    of the officers for all or virtually all of the time both before but most
    importantly after the alleged transaction. None of the officers saw him discard
    anything. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was an abundance of evidence that the appellant
    was known to the officers and recognized by them. The trial judge was satisfied
    on the issue of identity. In that context, she considered the anomaly of the
    missing money and drugs in the baggy, but because of the fact that the officers
    knew the appellant, she did not find that the missing items raised a reasonable
    doubt on the identity issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge did not address the question
    whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the transaction
    actually occurred. None of the officers observed the hand-to-hand transaction
    and specifically Officer McGuinness, who was in a position to see it as he
    observed the undercover officer and the appellant in the <span class=GramE>alleyway,</span> did not observe any hand-to-hand movement. Most significantly, however, the
    failure to find the buy money and the drugs on the appellant or after a search,
    together with the lack of opportunity for the appellant to dispose of these
    items, is unanswered evidence that speaks against the transaction having
    occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that on this record, the
    verdict is an unreasonable one and must be set aside. The appeal is allowed and
    an acquittal is entered.</p>
