    in Bells Corners, Ottawa.  The property
    contains a 12,000 square foot building divided into two restaurant
    facilities.  The appellant, Antonios
    Ishac, is the chief executive officer of the company.  He personally guaranteed a portion of the
    first mortgage on the property given by the respondent, the National Trust
    Company. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    2001, contamination was discovered on the property.  Petro-Canada, the owner of the adjoining
    land, admitted responsibility for the contamination.  Ultimately the parties entered into an
    agreement (the “remediation agreement”) under which Petro-Canada would pay for
    the remediation of the property and for other losses the company suffered as a
    result of the contamination.  The
    remediation did not proceed as planned and the company sued to enforce
    Petro-Canada’s obligations under the remediation agreement and for
    damages.   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    this time, the mortgage had fallen into arrears and National Trust obtained a
    court order appointing Deloitte &amp; Touche as receiver and manager.
    Eventually, the receiver was given authority over the claim against
    Petro-Canada and gave National Trust permission to try to resolve the matter
    directly with Petro-Canada. In September 2005, these two parties negotiated an
    agreement (the “settlement agreement”) whereby the damage claim would be
    settled, the property sold to Petro-Canada, and the company’s mortgage debt
    partially recovered and partially forgiven.  The receiver issued a report recommending the sale and settlement and
    moved for court approval.  </span></p>

    among other things, he approved the report and thereby the sale of the property <span class=GramE>to,</span> and the settlement of the damage claim with,
    Petro-Canada.  The appellants’ primary
    contentions are that the property will be sold for less than the “best price”
    that could have been obtained, and that the settlement is improvident because
    it would settle the company’s claims for a fraction of its actual entitlement
    under the remediation agreement. The receiver cross-appeals that part of the
    order granting the appellants leave to commence an action against the receiver
    based on its handling of the sale and settlement. National Trust adopts and
    supports the receiver’s position in the appeal from the judicial approval of
    the sale and settlement.</span></p>

    appellants are clearly unhappy with how matters pertaining to the property have
    played out.  However, the issues raised
    on appeal involve an analysis of the motions judge’s findings of fact applied
    to well-established legal principles applicable to the exercise of his
    discretion.  In my view, this analysis
    discloses no reviewable error on the part of the motions judge. Accordingly, I
    would dismiss the appeal.  For the
    reasons set out in paras. 93 and 94, I would allow the cross-appeal. </span></p>

    appellants also move to introduce fresh evidence concerning events that took
    place during the period that the decision was under reserve by the motions

    does not assist the appellants.</span></p>

    company purchased the property in 1995, in part with money borrowed from
    National Trust.  The loan was secured by
    a first mortgage in the amount of $650,000, registered against the
    property.  In 1997, additional funds were
    advanced for renovations and the mortgage was increased to $905,000.  This work was necessary as deficiencies in
    the building and equipment were interfering with the company’s ability to
    attract sufficient rental income to keep the mortgage in good standing.  </span></p>

    mortgage fell into arrears in 1999 after the renovations were completed.  As a result of these difficulties, National
    Trust exercised rights under the mortgage that allowed it to appoint an agent
    to collect and remit rents.  At that
    time, the approximate principal balance of the mortgage was $884,000.</span></p>

    February 2001, National Trust served a notice of intention to enforce
    security.  On October 30, 2001, the
    parties entered into a six-month forbearance agreement, crystallizing the
    obligations of the mortgagor and mortgagee as of that date.  By agreement, for the purposes of the
    forbearance agreement, the debt was fixed at $1,095,909.89, with the mortgage
    maturing on April 30, 2002.  </span></p>

    property had not been properly maintained and the company was having difficulty
    attracting sufficient rent to meet expenses.  As a result, the company decided to sell the property.  The company received a conditional offer of
    $1,450,000 with a closing date of February 1, 2002.  The offer was conditional, in part, on a
    satisfactory environmental assessment.  This assessment, completed in December 2001, demonstrated that the
    property was contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons that had escaped from a
    neighbouring property owned by Petro-Canada.  When the purchaser learned of the contamination, the sale was lost. </span></p>

    some time after the contamination was found, commercial tenants continued to
    lease the property. Under the terms of the forbearance agreement the company
    agreed to lease the property to Vox Lounge.  In March 2002, Vox renewed its lease for five years but only for part of
    the premises.  In April 2002, the remainder
    of the building was leased to Dianne Dang, carrying on business as Buffet Place.  Vox vacated in October 2003 and Ms. Dang,
    despite having been granted several reductions in rent, left in March
    2004.  Since then, the building has been

    parties agreed to arbitrate the company’s claims arising from Petro-Canada’s
    acceptance of responsibility for the contamination.  On February 3, 2003, just prior to the
    arbitration, the parties entered into the remediation agreement, the terms of
    which are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>1.
    [Petro-Canada] will proceed with the remediation action plan set out in its
    report at a time convenient to both [the company] and [Petro-Canada’s]
    consultants, but in any event not later than June, 2003, for the commencement
    of such work;</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>2.  All work and investigations will be carried
    out in a manner so as to minimize to the greatest extent possible any
    interference with [the company’s] lands and the ongoing operations by its
    tenants thereon;</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>3.  The
    remediation of [the company’s] lands is to be at no cost whatsoever to [the
    company] and all reasonable costs incurred by [the company] in the context of,
    or as a result of, the clean-up will be paid by [Petro-Canada]; </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>4.  Where
    the remediation interferes with the ongoing tenant businesses such that the
    tenant is required to either vacate the premises or is justified in not paying
    full rental during such remediation operations, then [Petro-Canada] will
    reimburse [the company] for any reasonable loss of tenant revenue including all
    costs incurred in obtaining alternative tenants, if a tenant is lost as a
    result of ongoing remediation operations;</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>5.
    [Petro-Canada] will pay [the company’s] reasonable consultant costs incurred by
    its consultants in supervising the remediation and testing to determine that
    appropriate remediation levels have been reached;</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>6.  All work forces and equipment will be
    employed in such a manner and in such a way as to minimize the visual impact of
    the ongoing clean-up operation to the greatest extent possible.</span></p>

    was discovered under the building, necessitating excavation through the floor
    of the building and underpinning of the structure.  This interior excavation started in August
    2004 but was delayed later in the month as a result of the Ministry of Labour’s
    concern about work-safety conditions.  Excavation
    resumed on September 20 but was again suspended a month later over a dispute

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motions judge approved the settlement agreement on the basis that the materials
    provided were sufficient to determine that the settlement was reasonable.  He did not find it necessary to address the
    appellants’ alternative request to replace the receiver.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Specifically,
    the motions judge found that the value proposed by the respondents for
    Petro-Canada’s purchase of the land was reasonable.  There was substantial evidence before the
    court, expert and otherwise, concerning the value of the property at the
    relevant times.  The motions judge
    expressed specific concerns about the evidence upon which the appellants relied.
    He ultimately concluded that he preferred the receiver’s evidence that the
    property,<i> in a completely remediated
    state</i>, was properly valued between $600,000 and $1,200,000.  Based on that finding, the motions judge held
    that the price Petro-Canada agreed to pay for the property actually exceeded
    its value.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    terms of the other major contentious area, the claim against Petro-Canada for
    damages resulting from the contamination, there were two issues.  First, the parties were divided over <span
class=GramE>who</span> should bear the responsibility for the loss of revenue
    and additional costs associated with the delay in the remediation work.  Second, the appellants argued before the
    motions judge, as they did before this court, that the remediation agreement
    required Petro-Canada to remediate the property despite the difficulties arising
    from excavating beneath the floor of the building.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to delay, the motions judge noted that Petro-Canada, citing
    difficulties in obtaining access to the property and in obtaining permission to
    remove soil through the building floor, blamed the company and the receiver for
    the delays. The receiver blamed the company for interfering with both the
    commencement and the scope of the remediation work. The appellants blamed the
    receiver for generally failing to take all proper steps to protect their rights
    under the remediation agreement.  The
    motions judge did not make a direct finding with regard to the ultimate cause
    of the delay. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    terms of complexity of the remediation work, the discovery of contamination
    under the building gave rise to a dispute over how to deal with it. After
    reviewing the evidence and arguments on that issue, the motions judge concluded
    that the building was beyond financially reasonable repair and had to be
    demolished to effect remediation of the contamination that had migrated through
    much of the property.  </span></p>

    the background of the recommendations of the receiver in its third report, the
    parties’ submissions, his findings, and the applicable law, the motions judge
    concluded that the process followed by the receiver in the complicated
    circumstances leading up to the request for approval of the sale and settlement
    was prudent and that the terms of sale and settlement recommended by the
    receiver were reasonable.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    the motions judge did, somewhat curiously, grant the appellants leave to
    commence or continue proceedings against the receiver for “negligence or a
    failure to act with a fiduciary’s due regard to the interests of a debtor” on
    the basis that if the allegations contained in Mr. Ishac’s affidavits were
    proven, it would not be “perfectly clear that there was no foundation for the
    claim or the action is frivolous and vexatious”. He made clear that he was “not
    deciding the merits of the owner’s claims that the receiver failed to win all
    of the benefits the owner believes he could have won from Petro-Canada”,
    despite his explicit finding that the “settlement is reasonable.”  </span></p>

    ORDERS APPROVING RECEIVERS’ REPORTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principles to be applied in reviewing a sale or
    proposed sale by a court-appointed receiver are set out in this Court’s
    decision in <i>HSBC Bank of Canada v.
    Deloitte &amp; Touche</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 355.  A court-appointed receiver has a fiduciary
    duty to act honestly and fairly on behalf of all who have an interest in the
    debtor’s property.  The receiver, as an
    officer of the court, is obliged to make full and fair disclosure to the court
    in all of its applications:  <i>HSBC </i>at para. 26.  The court should rely on the receiver’s
    expertise in arriving at its recommendations and is entitled to assume that the
    receiver is acting properly unless the contrary is clearly shown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly where, as in this case, the receiver is
    dealing with an &quot;unusual or difficult asset&quot;, the court will only
    interfere in special circumstances:  <i>HSBC</i> at para. 23.  While the court must carefully scrutinize the
    procedure the receiver followed, it must be remembered that the receiver must
    act “with meticulous correctness, but not to a standard of perfection”: <i>HSBC </i>at para. 26.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    I note that </span>the orders appealed from are discretionary in nature. As in

    the judge has erred in law, seriously misapprehended the evidence, or exercised
    discretion based on irrelevant or erroneous considerations or failed to give

    identified as considerations for the court in considering “whether a receiver
    who has sold a property acted properly”.  In my view, with appropriate modifications, the same factors can be
    applied in considering the providence of this settlement, where the values of
    both a property and a claim for damages are in issue:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn to the first <i>Soundair </i>factor, whether the receiver has made sufficient efforts
    to obtain the best price, both for the property and the claim against
    Petro-Canada.  Counsel for the appellants
    submits <span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;
'>that the settlement
    agreement substantially </span><span lang=EN-US>undervalues
    not only the property but also the company’s claim arising out of
    Petro-Canada’s breach of the remediation agreement. </span>What <span
lang=EN-US>the receiver should have done, say
    the appellants, is force Petro-Canada to honour its obligations under the
    remediation agreement, both in terms of the remediation itself and the
    compensation that it agreed to pay as a result of the contamination, and then sell
    the remediated property at fair market value.  This course of action, according to the appellants, would have resulted
    in National Trust’s recovering its mortgage debt, with leftover equity value
    for the appellants.  The motions judge’s
    approval of the settlement agreement as reasonable, according to the
    appellants, is unsupportable.  Rather,
    they argue, the settlement agreement is improvident.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    disagree.  </span>In my view, the motions
    judge’s conclusion that the receiver met its obligations, both in terms of the
    value of both components of the proposed settlement and in terms of the process
    by which it was arrived at, is amply supported by the application of the
    relevant legal principles to the motions judge’s findings of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law requires the receiver to pursue the debtor’s
    rights.  It is up to the receiver to
    carefully consider the available information and use its expertise to determine
    how to maximize the value of those rights. In relation to a cause of action,
    this responsibility can be met by settling the matter as long as the proposed
    compromise is commercially reasonable.</p>

    terms of the proposed sale of the property, the appellants take issue with the
    fact that the motions judge approved the receiver’s recommendation of a sale at
    a price, which assumed the land was remediated, but was determined when the
    property was in an unremediated state.  They contend that the receiver should have sought specific performance
    of Petro-Canada’s obligations to remediate the property, or damages in the
    alternative, and then sold the property for fair market value in a remediated
    state.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    it is highly unlikely that the receiver would have been successful in obtaining
    an order against Petro-Canada for specific performance of its remediation
    obligations.  </span>As the
    considerations set out in<i><span
lang=EN-US> Semelhago v. Paramadevan, </span></i>[1996]
    2 S.C.R. 415 at para. 14, demonstrate, the principles of specific performance
    are mainly related to the transfer of property (either personal or real) and
    even then only when the property is unique in some way.  As Estey J. wrote in <i>Asamera Oil Corp. v.
    Seal Oil &amp; General Corp.</i>, <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>[1979] 1 S.C.R. 633</span>, at p. 668, “[b]efore a plaintiff can rely
    on a claim to specific performance…some fair, real and substantial
    justification for his claim to performance must be found.”  There was nothing unique about this
    property.  Indeed, the only reason the
    company wanted it remediated was for the purpose of immediately selling
    it.  There is no justification for
    forcing Petro-Canada to go to the expense of remediating the land, when the
    appellants’ only interest is in the value of the land rather than the land
    itself.    </p>

    for the appellants argues that the damage claim, (putting aside for the moment
    the claim for loss of rental income) is either $1,735,000, using the “reduction
    in value” method, or $3,980,468, using the “cost of performance” method.  The “cost of performance” method of valuing
    damages from breach of contract, which Augustine takes to include the cost of
    destroying the building, remediating the property, and reconstructing the
    building, raises substantially the same issues as specific performance. I have
    already explained why this basis for damages is unavailable to the
    appellants.  Since the purpose of damages
    is to recover value that the appellants would have obtained under the contract,
    and since it is known that they intended to sell the property in order to pay
    their mortgage debt, the proper valuation method of damages is the
    &quot;reduction in value&quot; method.  See Swan, A., <i>Canadian Contract
    Law</i>, 2nd ed., (Markham: LexisNexis Canada, 2009), at pp. 370 – 379.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The question of the value of the land in a
    pristine state is critical for measuring the reduction in value of the property
    caused by the contamination.  The
    appellants are wrong, however, to argue that the only way to determine this
    value is to remediate the land and try to sell it on the open market.  <span lang=EN-US>The receiver utilized a commercially reasonable alternative method; it
    requested and received appraisals from several appraisers for the property,
    appraisals that assumed the property to be in an uncontaminated state.  The motions judge approved this method as legitimate
    and I agree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>So
    much for the method of determining value.  As for the value itself, </span>based on his preference of the
    receiver’s evidence concerning the value of the property over that of the
    appellants, the motions judge found that the proposed sale price of $1,187,000
    represented a fair value for the property.  This finding is sound.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge rejected the property value the
    appellants advanced through the Augustine affidavit – and properly so.  The Augustine analysis in support of a “reduction
    in value” of $1,735,000 was deficient.  Augustine
    accepted the 2003 Juteau valuation of the property notwithstanding its obvious flaws. <span lang=EN-US>The motions judge noted that Mr.
    Juteau acknowledged on cross-examination that he was “unaware of serious
    deficiencies in the premises and substantial rent reductions (and vacancies)
    resulting from them.”</span>  <span
lang=EN-US>The valuation was</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span>therefore based on a capitalization of rental income that
    did not take into account existing rental arrears or the high turnover in
    tenants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that Mr. Augustine made no attempt to reconcile
    or otherwise address the receiver’s expert and market evidence that supported
    the receiver’s position that the property in a remediated state, at the time it
    recommended the comprehensive settlement, had a value of between $900,000 and
    $1,050,000.  I refer to the receiver’s four
    comprehensive market value appraisals, the listing price recommended by real
    estate agents and the results of the listing agent’s attempts to sell the
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants also argued that, by reason of its mismanagement, the receiver was
    responsible for the property’s low value. This is not supported by the
    evidence.  The evidence before the
    motions judge, including the appraisal reports, demonstrated that when the
    receiver was appointed in June 2003, it inherited a rundown property struggling
    to attract and maintain tenants willing to pay rent sufficient to cover
    operating costs.  </span><span
lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants’ position is not assisted by the tender of an offer to purchase the
    property for $1,320,000 that the company received in January 2006, after the
    receiver sought approval of the proposed sale and settlement.  </span>The offer, never delivered to the
    receiver, was unsigned and contained conditions unfavourable to the vendor
    concerning remediation and the nature of the tenants.  As well, the receiver had no obligation to
    consider this offer, given its timing.   Moreover, the offer does not show that the price the receiver was
    recommending was so unreasonably low as to demonstrate that the receiver was
    acting improvidently in recommending it: see <i>Soundair</i>, at p. 9.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the motions judge’s decision to approve
    the sale to Petro-Canada for $<span lang=EN-US>1,187,500, </span>on the basis of the receiver’s recommendation is unassailable.  The receiver made appropriate efforts to
    obtain reliable information as to the value of the property.  It secured an agreement with Petro-Canada
    based on this value that was provident and in fact advantageous to the
    creditors and the appellants.   The fact
    that this agreement is with the polluter of the property, is, in my view, of no
    relevance.</p>

    December 2004, plus $35,000 per month after that to the date of Petro-Canada’s
    acceptance of the offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once again, I would not agree with this argument. It
    completely ignores the weaknesses of the claim, and the risks and costs
    associated with pursuing it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants approach the claim from the perspective
    that the receiver will be successful in demonstrating that the contamination
    was the sole cause of the loss of rental income.  As previously indicated, the record
    demonstrates quite clearly that this is not the case. Before the further
    contamination was discovered in the spring of 2004, Vox Lounge had abandoned
    the property and was in arrears of rent in the amount of $70,000, and the
    Buffet Palace’s rent arrears, part of which Mr. Ishac had forgiven due to its
    complaints about the state of the building, had reached $140,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the delay in the commencement of the remediation
    and the conflict over the reasons for that delay, added to the uncertainty over
    the amount that might be awarded against Petro-Canada.  The receiver claimed loss of rent from
    October 2003 to December 2004 in the amount of $214,262 and carrying costs
    including property management fees, property taxes, property insurance, legal
    fees and the receiver’s fees and utilities.  However, Petro-Canada denied many of these claims on the basis that the
    appellants bore responsibility for some, if not all, of the delay in the
    commencement of the remediation work from May until November 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then,
    there was further delay resulting from the dispute over how to remediate the
    soil under the building.  The remediation
    agreement did not address who would be required to bear the burden of the loss
    of rental income caused by that delay.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, Petro-Canada not only resisted the
    claim for loss of rental income, but also indicated it was going to launch a
    counter-claim for the costs caused by the appellants’ delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    evidence available to the receiver about the claim for loss of rental income
    demonstrated that the</span> amount of Petro-Canada’s ultimate liability for
    damages was far from certain. Furthermore, the receiver was well aware of the
    other costs associated with litigation of this complexity such as ongoing
    carrying costs and unrecoverable legal costs.   The receiver did not know, therefore, the exact value of this
    claim.  What it did know was that Petro-Canada
    and National Trust supported a comprehensive resolution of the mortgage debt, in
    addition to the $200,000 Petro-Canada agreed to pay.  Petro-Canada had already paid $318,000 to the
    company for damages arising from the contamination of the property pursuant to
    the arbitration award, and the receiver agreed to leave that amount with the
    company.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against this background the receiver made a realistic
    appraisal of value of the company’s ancillary claims against Petro-Canada.  It had to evaluate the risks and costs
    associated with litigation. This court must defer to the assessment and
    judgment of its independent receiver and to the exercise of discretion of the
    motions judge. In my view, the receiver’s appraisal and the motions judge’s
    review of the receiver’s recommendations based on that appraisal are, in all of
    the circumstances, perfectly sound.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><i>B. The Interests of All the Parties</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next part of the <i>Soundair</i> test requires that the judge conduct an examination of the
    interests of all the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The secured creditor, National Trust, supports the
    settlement.  It does so with the
    knowledge that it will realize a significant shortfall.  Petro-Canada also supports the settlement,
    and the interests of a party that has negotiated a settlement with a
    court-appointed receiver are very important: see <i>Soundair </i>at p. 12.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is only the appellants, the debtors, who opposed the
    proposal. They argue that the receiver’s dereliction of duty has deprived them
    of equity they had in the property at the time of the receivership.  They will recover nothing from this
    settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants contend that the acceptance of the receiver’s recommendations
    results in a loss to the company of approximately $400,000 in equity.  They base their argument on an alleged offer
    to purchase the property for $1,500,000 submitted before the contamination was
    discovered.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    the offer is not in evidence and the respondent argues that it was far from
    certain.  The reliable evidence that is
    in the record places the value of the property in an uncontaminated state between
    $900,000 and $1,200,000, roughly the amount of the mortgage debt at that
    time.  In my view, the record does not
    support the appellants’ position that the company had equity in the property at
    the time the contamination was discovered. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the receiver owes a duty to the appellants to
    treat them fairly.  However, its primary
    task is to ensure that the highest value is received for the assets so as to
    maximise the return to the creditors: <i>Soundair </i>at p. 12.  The duty of fairness also
    requires that it maximize the return to the debtors, but such a return is not
    always commercially feasible.  As Farley
    J. recognized in <i>Royal Bank v. Rose Park
    Wellesley Investments Ltd</i>., <span class=ssl21>[1995] O.J. No. 147 (Ont.
    C.J. Gen. Div.), at</span> para. 9, there will frequently be a point below
    which certain interested parties will be adversely affected by the receiver’s
    decision. If the receiver’s decision is otherwise reasonable, it is entitled to
    determine, in the words of Farley J. “where the cusp will lie”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the cusp lies at a place that is to no party’s clear
    advantage; the amount satisfies neither the appellants nor National Trust.  I further note that given that $2,016,466 was
    owing under the mortgage at the time the settlement was reached, the appellants
    would only stand to benefit if a purchaser could be found that was willing to
    pay almost twice the value of the property, or if Petro-Canada consented to pay
    out several times the amount it has indicated a willingness to pay in response
    to the damage claim for loss of rental income.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The losses these parties will suffer are unfortunate
    but are the reality of the circumstances that plagued this property with these
    issues in this market.  Also, it is
    important to bear in mind that n<span lang=EN-US>o
    payments had been made under the mortgage since 2001.  </span>As time goes by, the receiver’s costs
    constitute a priority charge on the property and therefore continue to reduce
    the amount available to pay National Trust and ultimately the appellants.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    purchaser that would be reasonably expected to purchase the property in its
    current state as though it were pristine.  Without the sale, it would have been impossible for National Trust
    otherwise to recover any significant portion of the debt.  The value of the claims against Petro-Canada
    was, as I have explained, uncertain, and the receiver could not have relied
    solely upon them in the discharge of its duties.  In considering the interests of those
    involved, and especially the receiver’s primary duty to recover the mortgage
    debt from the appellants, the balance is clearly in favour of endorsing the
    settlement, and the motions judge considered these factors in making his
    ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><i>C.    <span

    appellants’ complaint about the process appears to be that National Trust and
    Petro-Canada negotiated the price between them, essentially behind closed doors.  However, the receiver gave National Trust and
    Petro-Canada permission to negotiate a sale, if one could be reached, only
    after it proved impossible to continue with the appellants’ involvement.  The receiver’s conduct until this point was
    open and transparent.  It</span> obtained
    various professional opinions as to the market value of the property
    independent of the contamination.  These
    values were tested through the results of the listing and marketing
    initiatives.  The appellants sought and
    obtained a meeting for the purposes of negotiating a settlement.  They participated in that process until their
    demands threatened to interfere with any possibility that the negotiations
    would be successful.  The receiver was
    entitled to make the determination that, as the motions judge put it, “[the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge clearly put his mind to the

    release of his reasons and on the decision itself in relation to comments the
    motions judge is alleged to have made in the course of the in-chambers meeting.  On the basis of the pressure brought to bear
    on the motions judge by the receiver and the contradictions in the motions
    judge’s thinking between the meeting and the decision and within the decision
    itself, there is good reason to be concerned that the process was not fair. </span></p>

    the letters, I agree that it may have been preferable for the receiver to have
    consulted with counsel for the appellants before writing the two letters
    inquiring about the status of the release of the decision.  However, I am not persuaded that these letters,
    which were purely of an administrative nature, are any cause for concern about
    the integrity of the judicial process.  I

    demonstrates uncertainty in the motions judge’s mind about whether to approve
    the receiver’s recommendations.  This
    uncertainty is demonstrated, they say, by the length of time the matter was
    under reserve, the comments the motions judge made during the in-chambers
    meeting and the contradiction in the decision itself of approving the
    receiver’s recommendations and granting the appellants leave to commence an
    action against the receiver for breach of duty relating to its recommendations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    as this court has said in <i>Dusk v. Malone</i> (2003), 167 O.A.C. 333, at para. 3, “a lengthy delay in…releasing reasons,
    without more, will not automatically amount to a denial of a fair trial.  The fairness of a trial must be determined by

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[89]<span

    by lawyers who attended the meeting, is inconclusive in terms of what the
    motions judge said or was thinking.  He may
    have indicated some ambivalence about his view of the case at the time.  Regardless, he was entitled to go off and
    wrestle further with the decision.  He
    was entitled to make up his mind after that meeting and prepare reasons that
    support his decision to approve the settlement.</span></p>

    approving the receiver’s third report, the motions judge granted leave to the appellants
    to commence an action against the receiver on the basis that the receiver
    failed to perform its obligations in relation to the property, including
    recommending the sale and settlement.  The appellants submit that granting leave to bring such an action cannot
    be reconciled with approving the receiver’s third report.</span><span>  </span><span
lang=EN-US>It therefore shows the motions judge’s
    doubts about whether the receiver had acted properly in relation to the sale. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge was very clear in his reasons
    that he did not think the receiver had acted improperly.  He granted leave because “[h]owever
    difficult, [the appellants] might succeed in demonstrating negligence…”  He later reiterated that he was granting
    leave because it was not “perfectly clear that that there is no foundation for
    the claim or that the action is frivolous or vexatious.” <span> </span>It
    would appear that this concern motivated the motions judge to grant leave to
    the appellants to take proceedings against the receiver, in the light of the
    possibility that the receiver may not have acted “with a fiduciary’s due regard
    to the interests of the debtor”.  However, he obviously thought this was a long shot.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motions judge, in granting leave,
    applied the wrong test.  Rather than
    applying the low threshold he did, he should have been satisfied that the
    appellants had established a strong <i>prima
    facie</i> case, before granting leave.  The
    conduct that the appellants wish to impugn is exactly the same conduct approved
    by the motions judge: see <i>Bank of America
    Canada v. Willan Investments Ltd. </i>(1993), 23 C.B.R. (3d) 98.  As Blair J. put it at paras. 9 - 10:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='color:black'>In
    my opinion the &quot;normal&quot; test referred to above sets a threshold which
    is too low in cases where the activities of the Receiver, including the conduct

    been approved by the Court…</span>Were it otherwise there would be little point
    in a receiver or receiver/manager seeking an Order approving its conduct and
    activities in the exercise of its duties as an officer of the Court. The very
    purpose of the granting of such an Order is to afford the receiver some measure
    of judicial protection. To say that that shield may be readily pierced unless
    the receiver can show that &quot;it is perfectly clear&quot; there is no
    foundation to the proposed claim, or that it is frivolous or vexatious, is to
    render such protection virtually meaningless in situations where the approved
    conduct and the conduct subject to the proposed attack are in substance the
    same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge thought that this case did not apply
    because the receiver’s actions had not been the subject of previous court
    approval.  He did not consider that he had
    just approved the receiver’s actions in this very instance, and that the <i>Bank of America </i>rationale applies here
    as well.  It is contradictory and
    provides meaningless protection to a receiver, to grant an order approving its
    recommendations and simultaneously granting leave to bring an action for
    negligence or breach of fiduciary duty in arriving at these recommendations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No matter which test the motions judge used, granting
    leave in these circumstances does not necessarily reflect an uncertainty in his
    mind regarding the receiver’s recommendation of the overall appropriateness of
    the comprehensive settlement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on this analysis, <span lang=EN-US>there is nothing in the evidence that supports
    the conclusion that there was any unfairness in the judicial process. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION REGARDING THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case and given the
    principles courts must apply when reviewing the receiver’s recommendations, I
    can find no error on the part of the motions judge in the exercise of his
    discretion when granting the orders under appeal.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE CROSS-APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>As
    discussed above, the motions judge used the wrong test in granting leave to
    commence an action against the receiver.  For the</span> reasons given there, I would allow the cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal
    from the order approving the receiver’s third report approving the sale of the
    property and the settlement.  I would
    allow the cross-appeal and set aside the order granting leave to sue the
    receiver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the hearing, it was agreed that
    the parties would make submissions as to costs following the release of this
    decision.  Failing agreement as to costs
    both of the appeal and the cross-appeal, submissions are to be made according
    to the following timetable.  The receiver
    and National Trust may make written submissions, no longer than three pages, to
    be received by the senior legal officer, no later than May 17.  The appellants will make their submissions,
    again, no longer than three pages, to be received no later than May 25.  The receiver and National Trust may deliver a
    brief reply, no longer than two pages, to be received no later than May 28.  </p>
