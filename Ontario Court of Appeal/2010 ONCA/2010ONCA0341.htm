  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Margaret Ksiazek (“Ms. Ksiazek”), was
    injured in a motor vehicle accident.  She
    sued the lessor, the lessee and the driver of the vehicle that struck the car
    in which she was a passenger, claiming damages for injuries she sustained in
    the collision.  Various members of her
    family also claimed damages for loss of guidance, care and companionship under
    s. 61(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>e) of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. F.3.  The
    respondents admitted liability and a trial proceeded solely on the question of
    damages.  The trial has generated two
    appeals.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Appeal C44031</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the opening of trial, the plaintiffs successfully moved
    to have the Halton Regional Police Services Board (the “Board”) added as a party
    defendant.  The defendants appeal from
    that order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that there were “special
    circumstances” justifying the addition of the Board as a party defendant at the
    outset of trial.  The addition of the
    Board as a defendant did not alter the nature of the litigation or the ultimate
    payor of any award to be made.  Its only
    effect was to deny the defendants the benefit of the statutory deductible from
    any award of general non-pecuniary damages.  That deductible was not available after the Board was added as a
    defendant because the Board is a “non-protected defendant” under the statutory
    scheme in the <i>Insurance Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  Counsel for the defendants concedes, correctly,
    that the operation of a statutory provision to the disadvantage of the defendants
    in and of itself cannot be regarded as prejudice for the purpose of determining
    whether an order should be made adding a party defendant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel could not point to any prejudice other than to
    suggest that the amendment opened new heads of damages in respect of which the
    defendants did not have adequate opportunity to prepare prior to trial.  We cannot accept this submission.  If the defendants had wanted to seek out
    further evidence relating to any claimed heads of damages after the order adding
    the Board, they could have requested an adjournment.  Indeed, the trial carried on intermittently
    over the next three months.  There was
    ample time to muster any new evidence needed in response to the order adding
    the Board as a defendant.  No such evidence
    was gathered because, in our view, no such evidence was needed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants also argue that by virtue of s. 50 of
    the <i>Police Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.15, the Board’s liability for the tort committed by its police officer
    (the driver) is “derivative” and, therefore, limited to the officer’s
    liability.  Under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, the officer is a
    protected defendant and the statutory deductible would apply to any award made
    against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s position vis-à-vis the police officer under
    s. 50 of the <i>Police Services Act</i> is
    akin to that of an employer vis-à-vis its employee.  The jurisprudence referable to an employer’s
    liability under the statutory scheme in the <i>Insurance
    Act</i> is applicable to the Board’s liability for the conduct of the officer
    in this case.  Under that jurisprudence,
    liability as an employer is not subject to the statutory deductible available
    to protected defendants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from the order adding the Board as a party
    defendant is dismissed. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Appeal C46339 </span></h4>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span lang=EN-US> The Main Appeal</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs appeal from the trial judge’s assessment
    of damages on several grounds.  During
    oral argument, their attack on the assessment centred on the trial judge’s
    ruling that Ms. Ksiazek failed to mitigate her damages, thereby warranting a
    25% reduction in the general and past loss of income damages awarded to her at
    trial.  The plaintiffs contend that the
    trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the nature and duration of Ms.
    Ksiazek’s psychological injuries, which the plaintiffs claim prevented her from
    freely choosing to undertake treatment and medication regimes recommended by
    several of her health care providers.  This error, the plaintiffs submit, fatally tainted the trial judge’s damages
    assessment and his adverse mitigation findings.  We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs rely heavily on the fact that Ms.
    Ksiazek’s family physician appears to have prescribed anti-depressant
    medication for her shortly after the accident.  They argue that this suggests the early onset of debilitating
    psychological injuries.  But this fact, standing
    alone, is insufficient to establish that psychological injuries caused by the
    accident accounted for Ms. Ksiazek’s failure to adhere to certain of the
    treatment recommendations of her health care providers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Ms. Ksiazek acknowledged on cross-examination
    that her first complaint of any symptoms of psychological illness occurred in
    mid-January 1999, almost four months after the accident.  Further, medical evidence at trial accepted
    by the trial judge indicated that her anxiety and depression developed in
    mid-1999.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet, on the trial judge’s findings, Ms. Ksiazek
    declined various recommended treatments and medical care throughout the fall of
    1998, well before the onset of any symptoms of psychological injury.  The trial judge also found that Ms. Ksiazek
    did not suffer a head injury in the collision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings were open to the trial judge on the
    evidence.  They amply supported his
    conclusion that Ms. Ksiazek failed to act reasonably in mitigating her damages,
    thereby prolonging and exacerbating her injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also note that the trial judge accepted the evidence
    of one of Ms. Ksiazek’s treating physicians that if Ms. Ksiazek had followed
    the care recommendations made by her health care providers, there would have
    been a substantial improvement in her condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all these circumstances, we see no error in the
    trial judge’s mitigation findings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs also argue that, given the totality of
    the evidence, the trial judge erred in his overall evaluation of damages and in
    holding that Ms. Ksiazek did not sustain a head injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, we disagree.  The trial judge’s damages assessment attracts considerable deference
    from this court: see for example, <i>Naylor
    Group Inc. v. Ellis-Don Construction Ltd.</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 943, at para.
    80.  Further, as we have said, it was
    open to the trial judge to conclude on the evidence that Ms. Ksiazek did not
    suffer a head injury in the collision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, given the whole of the evidence and the
    trial judge’s findings, it cannot be said that the trial judge’s damages
    assessment is so inordinately low that it is a wholly erroneous estimate of Ms.
    Ksiazek’s damages.  We therefore dismiss
    the plaintiffs’ appeal concerning damages.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The Cross-Appeal on Damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of cross-appeal, the defendants argue that the
    trial judge erred by failing to reduce the damages awarded to the <i>Family Law Act</i> claimants by 25% on
    account of Ms.&nbsp;Ksiazek’s failure to mitigate her damages.  In support of this argument, they submit that
    derivative claims, like claims under s. 61(2)(e) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, should “follow the main action”, on the basis that
    proper mitigation by Ms. Ksiazek of her damages would have reduced the degree
    of guidance, care and companionship lost as a result of her injuries.  While this may be true in some cases, the
    defendants were unable to point to any authority in support of the proposition
    that a reduction of damages awarded under s. 61(2)(e) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> automatically follows
    from a reduction of an injured plaintiff’s non-pecuniary damages due to a
    failure to mitigate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants also rely on s. 61(3) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, which states: “In an
    action under subsection (1), the right to damages is subject to any
    apportionment of damages due to contributory fault or neglect of the person who
    was injured or killed.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, s. 61(3) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> does not assist the respondents.  That provision is concerned with contributory
    negligence, not mitigation of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we note that Ms. Ksiazek’s obligation to
    mitigate her damages was personal to her.  Her failure to mitigate cannot be visited automatically on the <i>Family Law Act</i> claimants.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The Defendants’ Costs Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants also seek leave to appeal the costs
    order made at trial.  The trial judge
    held that the plaintiffs were entitled to their costs on a partial indemnity
    basis throughout.  He assessed those
    costs at $287,995, including disbursements of $101,997.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants made two offers to settle prior to
    trial.  They argue that both offers,
    particularly the second, exceeded the judgment awarded and that they therefore should
    have had their costs on a partial indemnity basis from the date of the offers
    pursuant to rule 49.10(2).  Alternatively, the defendants argue that even if the offers were
    technically deficient, the amount of the second offer was substantially higher
    than the actual judgment.  Accordingly, the
    trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, should have awarded the
    defendants their costs from the date of that offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs maintain that the trial judge properly
    concluded that <span class=GramE>neither offer triggered the costs consequences
    of rule 49.10(2) and</span>, in any event, the trial judge did not err in
    exercising his discretion in granting the plaintiffs their costs on a partial
    indemnity basis throughout.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The damages as calculated by the trial judge were as
    follows:</p>
  <p><i>Margaret Ksiazek:</i></p>
  <p>General Damages                                         $45,000</p>
  <p>Past Lost Income                                          $54,600</p>
  <p>Future Care                                                   $7,500</p>
  <p><i>Family Law Act Claimants:</i></p>
  <p>Maria Ksiazek (mother)                              $10,000</p>
  <p>Henrick Ksiazek (father)                            $8,000</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Ksiazek’s own insurer made certain payments to her
    on account of lost income and future care.  Those amounts had to be deducted from the awards made at trial under
    those headings.  Those deductions reduced
    the amounts awarded for past lost income and future care to zero.  Consequently, damages to Ms. Ksiazek in the
    total amount of $45,000 and damages to the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> claimants in the total amount of $24,000 were awarded.  The total judgment was $69,000, plus
    prejudgment interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants’ first offer to settle was dated April
    23, 2003.  In that offer, the defendants offered
    to pay Ms. Ksiazek $75,000, plus prejudgment interest and costs on a partial
    indemnity scale.  This offer made no
    reference to any of the <i>Family Law Act</i> claimants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second offer was made in August 2005.  However, by agreement of the parties, it was effective
    as of February 10, 2005.  In this second
    offer, the defendants offered to pay Ms. Ksiazek a total of $140,000.  The second offer also contained offers of
    compensation to three of the four <i>Family
    Law Act</i> claimants.  Those offers
    totalled $7,000.  No offer was made to
    the fourth claimant, Christopher Ksiazek.  The second offer also provided for prejudgment interest and payment of
    costs in an amount to be agreed by the parties.  Paragraph 9 of the second offer read, “The terms of this offer are not
    severable.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs offered to settle for a lump sum payment
    of $250,000, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  The plaintiffs did not apportion that amount
    among themselves.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two significant facts emerge from a comparison of the defence
    offers and the judgment:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither defence offer exceeded the amounts
    awarded to each of the <i>Family Law Act</i> claimants.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The total funds offered in both defence offers
    exceeded the actual amount of the judgment.  The first offer was $6,000 higher than the amount awarded at trial.  The second offer was $78,000 higher.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We find it necessary to address three of the
    submissions advanced by the defendants:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the offers made to multiple plaintiffs in
    amounts that did not exceed the sums awarded at trial to each plaintiff fall
    within rule 49.10(2)?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What were the proper amounts to be compared for
    the purpose of rule 49.10(2), when assessing whether either defence offer
    exceeded the amount of the judgment? </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Did either of the defence offers qualify as a rule
    49.10(2) offer?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial judge that neither offer made
    by the defendants attracted the consequences of rule 49.10(2) because neither
    offer contained offers to each plaintiff that exceeded the sums awarded in
    favour of that plaintiff under the trial judgment.  In particular, in the second offer, the
    defendants expressly provided that the terms of the offer were not
    severable.  They cannot now ask the court
    to effectively treat the offer made to the main plaintiff, Ms. Ksiazek, as
    severable from the offers made to the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> claimants for the purpose of attracting the costs consequences of rule
    49.10(2).  </p>

lang=EN-US>(b)<span

lang=EN-US>What amounts should be compared
    for the purpose of determining costs?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the defendants that the trial judge erred
    in comparing the aggregate amount of the defence offers with the amount
    assessed as damages at trial before deduction of the amounts paid to Ms.
    Ksiazek by way of accident benefits under s.&nbsp;267.8(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  The trial judge should have compared the
    amounts contained in the offers with the actual amount of the judgment: see <i>Pilon v. Janveaux</i> (2006), 211 O.A.C. 19 (C.A.),
    at para. 16.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court’s decision in <i>Ryder v. Dydyk</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 507, relied on by the trial
    judge, turns on the express language of s. 267.5(9) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, which addresses only entitlement to costs without
    regard to the statutory deductions to be made from general damages.  That provision requires the court to ignore
    the amount that must be deducted under the statute from non-pecuniary damages when
    applying rule 49.10.  Section. 267.5(9) <span
class=GramE>is</span> not applicable to first party insurer payments for lost
    income or future care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 49.10 should be applied according to its wording and
    purpose.  It is designed to encourage
    settlement by forcing the plaintiff who is offered money beyond that received
    by way of statutory accident benefits, to compare the amount of the “new money”
    offered with the amount of the actual judgment that may be obtained after trial.  The actual judgment will be the net of the
    amount assessed as damages minus any statutory accident benefits paid on
    account of lost income or future care.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>What costs order should have been
    made?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of a proceeding are in the discretion of the
    court:  <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, <span class=GramE>s</span>.
    131(1).  In exercising its discretion,
    the court may take into account offers to settle even if those offers do not
    fall within rule 49.10:  rule 49.13.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge exercised his discretion in favour of
    granting the plaintiffs costs on a partial indemnity basis throughout.  He did so even on the assumption that the
    defendants’ offers did trigger rule 49.10(2).  That rule directs that even where the defendant would be entitled to its
    costs given the offer made, the court may “order otherwise”.  The trial judge referred to several factors
    in exercising his discretion as he did, including the fact that “the difference
    between the offer and the judgment is not large”.  In coming to that conclusion, the trial judge
    mistakenly compared the amount of the defendants’ offers to the amount of the
    damages calculation ($134,000) before deducting the amount of the paid
    statutory accident benefits, rather than the actual amount of the judgment ($69,000).  On a comparison of the proper numbers, the
    defendants’ first offer ($75,000) was only slightly higher than the actual
    judgment, but their second offer ($147,000) was more than double the amount
    awarded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the amount set out in the second offer is compared
    to the actual judgment, that second offer must carry considerable weight in
    assessing costs.  While the offers did
    not exceed the amounts awarded to the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> claimants, the total offered was generous and much more favourable
    to the plaintiffs as a group than was the judgment eventually obtained after
    trial.  In this case, the plaintiffs’
    claims properly can be considered as a single unit.  Looked at in that way, the second offer was
    in substance much better than the judgment and should have been accepted by the
    plaintiffs.  There is no suggestion that
    the amounts offered to the individual <i>Family
    Law Act</i> claimants were in any way relevant to the plaintiffs’ decision to
    refuse the second offer.  Although the plaintiffs
    believed, not unreasonably, that they could do much better at trial, it turned
    out, after a 25-day trial, that the plaintiffs’ assessment was wrong.  In exercising its discretion regarding costs,
    a court should accord significant cost consequences to such a <span
class=SpellE>miscal-culation</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs were successful at trial.  Consequently they are <i>prima facie</i> entitled to their costs.  The question is how much should the plaintiffs’
    refusal to accept the defendants’ second offer tell against the plaintiffs in
    the exercise of the court’s discretion concerning costs?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the purposes underlying the rules with
    respect to settlement offers, the fact that the non-compliance with rule
    49.10(2) was more technical than substantive and the reality that the amount of
    the defendants’ second offer greatly exceeded the judgment, we think that the
    interests of justice would be served by requiring the parties to pay their own
    costs after the operative date of the second offer, subject to our comments
    below regarding disbursements.  The
    plaintiffs, of course, are entitled to their costs on a partial indemnity basis
    prior to that date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to this conclusion, we have exercised <span
class=GramE>a discretion</span> independent of that of the trial judge.  The trial judge’s misapprehension as to the
    appropriate numbers to be used when comparing the defendants’ settlement offers
    to the judgment obtained constitutes an error in principle allowing this court
    to exercise its own discretion.  However,
    we have also considered the other factors identified by the trial judge.  In our view, those factors considered with
    the actual timing of the second offer (the eve of trial) justify awarding the
    plaintiffs their disbursements throughout ($101,997) but no part of their legal
    fees after the agreed effective date of the second offer.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal the costs
    order, allow the costs appeal, and vary the costs order in accordance with
    these reasons.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Costs of the Appeals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The results on the appeals are mixed.  The defendants failed on their appeal
    (C44031).  Both the plaintiffs and the
    defendants failed on their appeals from the damages awards.  The defendants were successful on their costs
    appeal.  In light of these results, there
    should be no costs with respect to either appeal.  </p>
