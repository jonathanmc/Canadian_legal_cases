  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 5, 2009, the appellant Adam Mann was
    convicted of five offences – robbery with a firearm, carrying a concealed
    weapon, unauthorized possession of a firearm, possession of a prohibited or
    restricted firearm with ammunition, and possession of a firearm or ammunition
    contrary to a prohibition order – at the conclusion of a trial before Jennis J.
    of the Ontario Court of Justice in Hamilton.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 13, 2009, the trial judge sentenced Mr. Mann
    to a global sentence of 12 years.  The
    key components of the sentence were ten years for robbery with a firearm, and
    two years consecutive (with 2:1 credit for nine months pre-sentence custody)
    for possession of a firearm contrary to a prohibition order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.  The main issue on appeal <span class=GramE>relates</span> to the 12 year global sentence – does it offend the parity principle given that
    the appellant’s co-accused, his cousin Pierre Mann, received a global sentence
    (from a different judge) of five years for his participation in essentially the
    same criminal activity?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 24, 2008, Adam and Pierre Mann entered a
    private dwelling house on Barton St. East in Hamilton.  Both men were carrying loaded firearms.  The house was being used by Troy Collin-Miller
    and his grandmother as premises for an unlicensed business of selling alcohol (a
    “booze can”).  The Manns showed the
    victims their firearms and robbed them of some money, including rolled
    coins.  As the Manns were leaving, they
    threatened to kill the victims if they called the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A short time later, two plainclothes officers, who had
    been alerted by dispatch to the robbery, saw two suspects matching the
    description of the alleged robbers getting into a taxi cab.  Pierre Mann was arrested and found with a
    loaded handgun and money, including a substantial amount of rolled coins that
    the victims had reported <span class=GramE>were</span> taken in the robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other suspect fled and was chased by one of the
    officers.  The suspect managed to
    escape.  However, he dropped a cell phone
    and a loaded <span class=SpellE>Webley</span> handgun, and he lost a baseball
    cap.  Testing of the cap identified the
    DNA of Adam Mann.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pierre Mann pleaded guilty to three offences – use of a
    firearm during commission of an indictable offence, possession of a prohibited or
    restricted firearm with ammunition, and possession of a firearm contrary to a
    prohibition order.  He received a global
    sentence of five years for these offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial, Adam Mann was convicted of the five
    offences set out above and received a global sentence of 12 years.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>DISCUSSION</u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The
    conviction appeal</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant made a brief submission on his own
    behalf.  He said that he did not commit
    the crimes and that he was convicted because “the witnesses lied”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see nothing in the record, including the trial
    judge’s assessment of the evidence of the various witnesses in his reasons for
    judgment, to support the appellant’s assertion.  I would dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The
    sentence appeal</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, with the assistance of a very able
    argument by duty counsel Joseph Di Luca, contends that his sentence of 12 years
    offends the parity principle in light of the five year sentence imposed on the
    co-accused Pierre Mann.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with a preliminary point.  There are some differences in the offences as
    between the two offenders.  The appellant
    was convicted of five offences; Pierre Mann was convicted of three
    offences.  The most serious offence for
    the appellant was robbery; the most serious offence for Pierre Mann was use of
    a firearm during commission of an indictable offence.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is also a difference in the way the two judges
    calculated the time to be served for the offence of possession of a firearm
    contrary to a prohibition order.  The
    trial judge imposed a sentence on the appellant of two years consecutive for
    this offence.  The trial judge in Pierre
    Mann’s case imposed a sentence of one year concurrent for the same offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in this case both counsel proceeded on the
    basis that given the actual events that unfolded, and the joint role of the two
    offenders throughout, the sentences that needed to be compared for purposes of
    the parity issue were the appellant’s global sentence of 12 years and the
    co-accused’s global sentence of five years.  I agree and will proceed on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principle of parity of sentences is explicitly set
    out in s. 718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also
    take into consideration the following principles:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) <span class=GramE>a</span> sentence should be
    similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences
    committed in similar circumstances;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rationale for the principle is stated concisely in
    Clayton Ruby’s <i>Sentencing</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2008) at para. 2.21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The principle of parity has developed to preserve
    and ensure fairness by avoiding disproportionate sentences among convicted
    persons where, essentially, the same facts and circumstances indicate
    equivalent or like sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While parity is a guiding principle of sentencing, it
    is not, as stated by this court in <i>R. v.
    Miller (J.)</i> (2002), 163 O.A.C. 63, at para. 9, to be applied in an absolute
    fashion: “parity is only one of a number of principles that must be taken into
    consideration in imposing an appropriate sentence, and it cannot in and of
    itself dictate the result in all cases involving similar offenders committing
    similar crimes”.  In <i>R. v. L.M.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 36, the Supreme Court of
    Canada expressed a similar view: “Owing to the very nature of an individualized
    sentencing process, sentences imposed for offences of the same type will not
    always be identical.  The principle of
    parity does not preclude disparity <i>where
    warranted by the circumstances</i>, because of the principle of
    proportionality” (emphasis in original).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate courts must demonstrate substantial deference
    to sentencing decisions: see <i>R. v.
    Shropshire</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 and <i>R.
    v. M. (C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.  In the context of the parity principle, this means that “a court of
    appeal should only intervene to minimize the disparity of sentences where the
    sentence imposed by the trial judge is in substantial and marked departure from
    the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar
    crimes”: see <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i>, at p.
    567.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case law, whether a sentence represents “a
    substantial and marked departure” can involve inquiries into two comparison
    groups – a co-accused and other offenders sentenced for a similar crime.  In my view, it is appropriate to consider
    both potential comparison groups in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge focussed his parity analysis on the
    sentence given to the co-accused Pierre Mann, namely, five years.  The trial judge was of the view that a much
    higher sentence for the appellant was justified by two factors – Pierre Mann’s
    early guilty plea and the more serious criminal record of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, both of these factors supported the trial
    judge’s ultimate sentence for the appellant.  A guilty plea, especially an early one, is entitled to a substantial credit
    in the sentencing process.  And in this
    case, the appellant’s long criminal record (22 previous convictions) was
    replete with convictions for offences involving weapons and violence.  Indeed, when the appellant was sentenced in
    March 2009, he was only 25 years old, but was being sentenced for his fourth
    robbery (Pierre Mann had one previous conviction for robbery).  He also had previous convictions for
    aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  Moreover, the longest previous sentence imposed on the appellant was
    three years and seven months, whereas Pierre Mann’s longest previous sentence
    was six months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the other potential comparison category,
    namely, other offenders convicted of similar offences.  This court has said that the range of sentences
    for offences committed in home invasion cases is four to five years at the low
    end, and up to 11 to 13 years at the high end: see <i>R. v. Wright</i> (2006), 216 C.C.C. (3d) 54, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    23.  In that case, Blair J.A. said that a
    sentencing judge in a home invasion case “must give priority to the sentencing
    objectives of deterrence and denunciation” and that “a lengthy penitentiary
    term is fully warranted upon conviction for a home invasion offence”: see <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 12 and 15, respectively. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Wright</i>,
    the home invasion involved robbery with a firearm and this court upheld an
    eight year sentence.  The accused pleaded
    guilty to the offences with which he was charged, he had a minor criminal
    record, and he expressed remorse, a desire to make amends, and a willingness to
    take responsibility for his actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the appellant did not plead guilty, has a
    serious criminal record for violent offences, and has now been convicted of
    robbery four times.  Moreover, his
    pre-sentence report is very bleak indeed and includes these statements:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Ministry records show a pattern of minimization of
    behaviour, lack of remorse and lack of responsibility for his actions.  A police report quoted the offender, as
    describing the act of stabbing a female victim “like a knife going through
    butter”.  His pattern of minimization and
    deflection of responsibility is ongoing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The subject has continually displayed lack of
    respect for authority and a continued defiance towards conventional rules.  He is not suitable for community supervision,
    as he appears to be an unmanageable risk while in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred to all of these factors in his
    sentencing reasons.  He also reviewed
    several leading cases dealing with home invasion robberies, including <i>Wright</i>, and concluded that “robberies,
    such as home invasions with loaded guns, are to be treated with denunciation
    and deterrence as foremost sentencing objectives.”  In all the circumstances, I can see no error,
    including violation of the parity principle, in his determination that a 12
    year global sentence was warranted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
