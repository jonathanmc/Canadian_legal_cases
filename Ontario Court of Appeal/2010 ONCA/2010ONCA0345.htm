    issue in the litigation was whether the vendor, the respondent King Line
    Investments, was entitled to a readjustment of the purchase price of
    approximately $433,000.  The trial judge
    concluded that it was entitled to this readjustment.  We agree with his conclusion and
    substantially with his reasoning.</span></p>

    appellant, 973976 Ontario Limited can succeed only if the rollover credit agreed
    to by King Line was one of the “terms and conditions” of the <span
class=SpellE>Cesan</span> substituted offer.  However, as the trial judge correctly concluded, the rollover credit was
    not a term and condition of the contract, but simply an adjustment to the
    purchase price.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
    as there were 28 co-tenants in King Line, the rollover credit was to be
    calculated by taking 6/28 of the purchase price of both properties ($12
    million), and not, as 973976 contends, by taking 6/14 of the $7 million
    purchase price for one of the properties.  </span></p>

    Line settled with its solicitor for $100,000.  To avoid what he characterized as “double recovery”, the trial judge
    applied the $100,000 as a credit to the damages award against 973976.  King Line submits that he erred in doing
    so.  We agree.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge’s error was in concluding (at para. 15 of his costs endorsement)
    that legal costs are not a proper head of damages.  The decision of this court in <i>Toronto Industrial Leasehold Ltd. v. <span
class=SpellE>Posesorski</span></i>, [1994] O.J. No. 2691 stands for the
    principle that when a client must sue a third party because of its lawyer’s
    negligence, the client’s costs of suing may be claimed as damages against its
    lawyer.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the <i>Toronto Industrial Leasehold</i> case, the lawyer was held responsible for the additional costs incurred by his
    negligence.  The case before us is the
    reverse.  King Line seeks to apply all or
    a portion of the $100,000 settlement funds from its lawyer to its otherwise
    unrecoverable costs against 973976.  In
    our view, although the factual situation differs, the principle from <i>Toronto Industrial Leasehold</i> applies to
    this case.  Doing the best we can with
    the evidence, in the absence of a full assessment, we attribute $50,000 of the
    settlement funds to King Line’s unrecoverable costs against 973976.  Accordingly, we allow King Line’s costs
    appeal and reduce its judgment against 973976 by $50,000 instead of $100,000.</span></p>
  <h3>(b)       Pre-judgment
    interest</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge denied King Line pre-judgment interest from the date of closing
    (July 25, 2005) to the date the statement of claim was issued (September 19,
    2006).  He did so because both parties
    had agreed to delay the commencement of the litigation.  We agree with King Line that the trial judge
    erred in denying it pre-judgment interest from July 25, 2005.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pre-judgment
    interest is essentially compensatory.  Admittedly, dilatory conduct by a successful party may deprive it of
    pre-judgment interest.  However, in this
    case the delay was a mutual decision and thus affords no basis for depriving
    King Line of its pre-judgment interest.  Accordingly, the appeal on pre-judgment interest is allowed, and
    pre-judgment interest will run from the date of closing, July 25, 2005.</span></p>
  <h3>(c)       Costs of the appeal and
    cross-appeal</h3>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    accordance with the agreement of the parties, King Line is entitled to its
    costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal in the total amount of $20,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</span></p>
