  <h2>I.         OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In the
    late afternoon of November 23, 2003, the appellant and Angie Pauls, his common
    law wife of some 25 years, were alone together on a rocky outcropping located on
    the Niagara Escarpment several metres from a hiking trail in the Mount Nemo
    Conservation Area in Burlington, Ontario.  Seconds after they decided to leave, Ms. Pauls was lying in a gully almost
    20 metres below.  Her neck was
    broken.  She died there.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged with first degree
    murder.  The outcome of the trial turned
    essentially on a single issue – could the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant had pushed Ms. Pauls off the cliff to her death?  If the Crown could satisfy the jury that the
    appellant had pushed Ms. Pauls to her death, the further findings that he
    intended to kill her and that he had planned and deliberated the murder were readily
    available.  However, if the Crown could
    not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant pushed Ms. Pauls off the
    cliff, an acquittal was the only possible verdict.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown’s case was circumstantial.  There was evidence of opportunity.  The appellant was the only person near Ms.
    Pauls when she died.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was also evidence of motive.  The appellant was involved in a long-term
    ongoing affair with another woman, Honorine Veldmeyer.  Ms. Pauls had discovered that affair in 2002,
    about a year before her death.  The
    appellant had, however, remained with Ms. Pauls.  Their relationship became tenser after Ms.
    Veldmeyer gave birth to the appellant’s child early in 2003.  On the Crown’s theory, the relationship
    between Ms. Pauls and the appellant became more strained in the months leading
    up to her death.  The Crown contended
    that the appellant became verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards Ms.
    Pauls.  On the Crown’s theory, the
    appellant decided to end his relationship with Ms. Pauls so he could start a
    new life with Ms. Veldmeyer and their baby.  However, he did not want to give up his cherished home, which he jointly
    owned with Ms. Pauls.  The Crown alleged
    that the appellant decided that murder was the solution to his problems.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown also relied on statements made by the
    appellant concerning the circumstances surrounding Ms. Pauls’ fall and his
    efforts to help her.  The Crown alleged
    that these statements contained certain admissions.  The Crown further contended that the
    statements contained a number of fabrications that could support the inference
    that the appellant had planned to take Ms. Pauls to the remote location, push
    her from the cliff and make it seem like an accident, and had carried out that
    plan on November 23, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to opportunity, motive and the
    appellant’s statements, the Crown relied on after-the-fact conduct by the
    appellant as indicative of his guilt.  In
    particular, the Crown relied on the appellant’s concerted efforts to hide his
    ongoing affair from the police and mislead them in the course of their
    investigation.  There was also evidence
    of other after-the-fact conduct that was relatively insignificant at the
    trial.  I will refer to some of this
    other evidence when I address the third ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant testified and denied pushing Ms.
    Pauls off the cliff.  He gave a detailed description
    of her accident and his efforts to help her.  The defence maintained that the appellant’s testimony on central points was
    consistent with the many statements he had made to the first responders, the police
    and others in the minutes, days and months following Ms. Pauls’ death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant admitted having a long-term affair
    and conceded that it put considerable strain on his relationship with Ms. Pauls,
    particularly after Ms. Veldmeyer had their baby in February 2003.  The appellant testified, however, that by the
    time of Ms. Pauls’ death in November 2003, he had decided that he wanted to be
    with Ms. Pauls and was committed to that relationship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defence adduced evidence that Ms. Pauls was
    taking medication that could have affected her balance.  She was prone to leg cramps and was significantly
    overweight.  Her friends considered her to
    be somewhat clumsy. The defence argued that one or more of these facts could
    have caused Ms. Pauls to lose her balance and fall off the cliff. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant explained that he lied to the
    police about his affair because he wanted to protect his child and was afraid
    that if the police knew about the affair, they would become suspicious.  He also contended that the after-the-fact
    conduct relied on by the Crown, apart from the evidence about his efforts to
    conceal his affair, had no possible probative value.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jury convicted the appellant of first degree
    murder.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant focused his oral

  <h2>II.        THE FACTS</h2>
  <h2><span>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span>Events
    Prior to Ms. Pauls’ Death</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Ms. Pauls began to live
    together in 1982.  They purchased a home
    at 17 Ivan Avenue in Grimsby, Ontario around 1988.  By all accounts, they both enjoyed their home
    and were happy until 1999, when the appellant began a long-term affair with Ms.
    Veldmeyer.  The appellant led Ms. Veldmeyer
    to believe that although he continued to live with Ms. Pauls, their spousal relationship
    was over.  This was not true.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Pauls first suspected that the appellant was
    having an affair in 1999.  She confronted
    him but he denied it.  Their friends noticed
    that his attitude toward her began to change around that time.  The appellant became curt and verbally
    abusive toward Ms. Pauls.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer became pregnant in 2001 but,
    against the appellant’s wishes, decided to have an abortion.  The appellant told her that he wanted to
    marry her and went so far as to buy her an engagement ring.  At the same time, the appellant continued to
    live with Ms. Pauls and deny that he was having an affair.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer became pregnant for a second time
    in the spring of 2002.  The appellant
    again asked her to marry him, and they made plans for a fall wedding.  He gave her an engagement ring on October 2,
    2002.  He was still living at 17 Ivan
    Avenue with Ms. Pauls and still denying that he was having an affair.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In September or October 2002, Ms. Pauls found
    receipts for a wedding dress and an engagement ring.  She confronted the appellant and he finally
    admitted that he was having an affair with Ms. Veldmeyer.  He told Ms. Pauls that Ms. Veldmeyer was
    pregnant.  Ms. Pauls went to see a lawyer
    in November 2002 to discuss separation from the appellant.  Friends noticed that the relationship between
    the appellant and Ms. Pauls became very strained.  They were barely civil to each other. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant had a strong emotional attachment to
    their home at 17 Ivan Avenue.  As it was
    their principal mutual asset, the home became the focal point of much
    discussion as their relationship deteriorated in late 2002 through to 2003.  Several witnesses testified that the
    appellant was adamant that he would not allow the house to be sold to generate
    the funds necessary to divide the family assets if he and Ms. Pauls dissolved
    their relationship.  The appellant told
    Ms. Pauls and various friends that he would rather “burn the place down” than
    let a realtor into the home.  For her
    part, Ms. Pauls indicated that she was too afraid of what the appellant might
    do to force him to sell the house.  The
    appellant testified that if he had to, he could have raised the money to pay
    Ms. Pauls for her interest in the house.  The Crown challenged that claim.  The evidence on the issue was unclear.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer gave birth to the appellant’s
    child in February 2003.  At the time, the
    appellant was on holiday in Mexico with Ms. Pauls and two friends, Johann and
    Renate Lutsch.  According to Mr. and Mrs.
    Lutsch, things became very tense between the appellant and Ms. Pauls.  She was upset, angry and embarrassed.  Her friends knew about the pending birth of
    the appellant’s child.  According to the
    appellant, he and Ms. Pauls decided to work things out during this
    vacation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer was angry at the appellant for not
    being present at the birth of his child.  However, she relented when it became obvious to her that the appellant
    was strongly attached to his new daughter.  The appellant asked Ms. Veldmeyer to “wait a while longer” as he made
    the necessary arrangements to sell the home at 17 Ivan Avenue and come to a
    financial settlement with Ms. Pauls.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In October 2003, the appellant returned the
    engagement ring to Ms. Veldmeyer.  She
    had given it back to him some time before that.  The appellant assured Ms. Veldmeyer that things would get settled but he
    asked her not to show the ring around.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span

    2003, Ms. Pauls was afraid of the appellant and the appellant had physically
    assaulted her on at least two occasions.  That evidence consisted of statements made by Ms. Pauls to friends.  The appellant challenges the admissibility of
    some of that evidence.  I will review
    that evidence when I consider the first ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is sufficient for the purposes of this
    summary to indicate that Ms. Pauls told friends that she was subjected to both
    physical and emotional abuse by the appellant during the summer and fall of
    2003.  She told these same friends that
    she was afraid of the appellant and could not bring their relationship to a
    head either by compelling him to leave home or by leaving herself.  She spoke of sleeping with a machete beside
    her bed because of her fear of the appellant and asked two friends to notify
    the police if anything happened to her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant testified that there were tensions
    in his relationship with Ms. Pauls brought on by his continued affair with Ms. Veldmeyer
    and the arrival of their child.  He
    denied that he ever physically assaulted Ms. Pauls.  In answer to the specific allegations, he
    indicated that Ms. Pauls may have fallen against the fridge because her medication
    caused leg cramps.  He also denied ever
    threatening her with a knife.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer testified that after their child
    was born, the appellant told her they would be married and live together in the
    house at 17 Ivan Avenue.  In the fall of
    2003, he would often drive her and the child past the house and they would
    discuss which room would be the baby’s room.  On the Friday two days before Ms. Pauls’ death, Ms. Veldmeyer met the
    appellant for lunch.  He seemed tense and
    agitated.  The appellant told Ms. Veldmeyer
    that starting the next weekend he would be able to go to church with her on
    Sundays.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant testified that his visits with Ms.
    Veldmeyer were primarily to see his baby and not Ms. Veldmeyer.  He said he never suggested they would move
    into the home on Ivan Avenue and that, although he returned the engagement ring
    to Ms. Veldmeyer, he had no intention of marrying her.  He planned to stay with Ms. Pauls.  The appellant explained that his reference to
    being available to go to church the next weekend was based on an anticipated
    change in his work schedule.    </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant went to the Mount Nemo
    Conservation Area on Saturday, November 22, 2003.  He did not tell the authorities about this
    trip until March 21, 2004.  There was
    evidence that when he ultimately disclosed this fact to the police, he believed
    they were already aware of it through their investigation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On Sunday, November 23, 2003, the appellant and
    Ms. Pauls went hiking in the Mount Nemo Conservation Area.  They sometimes hiked together, although there
    was evidence that while Ms. Pauls enjoyed being outdoors with the appellant,
    she did not enjoy hiking.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Ms. Pauls spent the morning
    doing work around the house.  A neighbour
    testified that they seemed to be in a good mood.  The appellant and Ms. Pauls had plans to take
    on a significant new cleaning contract the next week. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Ms. Pauls left home early in
    the afternoon and arrived at the conservation area about 2:00 p.m.  It was a sunny late fall day.  There were many cars in the parking area and
    a lot of activity within the conservation area.  The appellant and Ms. Pauls walked a long distance along the trail before
    leaving the trail and travelling a short distance to a rocky outcropping on the
    Niagara Escarpment.  The appellant
    testified that he and Ms. Pauls decided to climb the rocky outcropping and have
    their picnic on a flat platform area on top of the outcropping.  There was a drop of about 60 feet from the
    edge.  There was evidence that Ms. Pauls
    was afraid of heights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to the appellant, he and Ms. Pauls had
    a relaxed and enjoyable lunch.  Afterward, they prepared to hike back to their car.  The appellant climbed down from the platform
    and began to walk up a short path that led back towards the main trail.  His back was turned to Ms. Pauls.  The appellant testified that as he neared the
    main trail, he heard Ms. Pauls say that she saw something below the outcropping.  Without turning around, he said words to the effect,
    “Let’s go, it doesn’t matter”.  The
    appellant had not finished his sentence when he heard a scream.  He turned around but could not see Ms.
    Pauls.  At trial, the appellant testified
    that he ran to where they had been picnicking and looked down to see Ms. Pauls
    lying at the bottom of the cliff.  He saw
    her body roll “from left to the right”.  In one of his statements to the police, the appellant indicated that he
    saw Ms. Pauls’ body “bouncing” down the steep hill below the cliff.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant testified that he did not shout
    down to Ms. Pauls, but instead immediately scrambled down the side of the steep
    cliff, sliding on his backside and legs to the gully below.  When the appellant got to Ms. Pauls, she was
    lying on her back.  He tried to lift her,
    but could move her only a few feet.  He
    testified that she asked him to go for help.  He made his way down the steep and difficult terrain to the nearby home
    of Mr. Wiens, who called for help.  The
    appellant testified that he immediately returned to Ms. Pauls and was by her
    side when the firefighters, followed by the paramedics, arrived.  The firefighters administered CPR.  When a paramedic arrived, she checked for
    vital signs and declared Ms. Pauls dead.  Ms. Pauls died of a broken neck.  The
    other injuries revealed by the subsequent post-mortem could also be attributed
    to her fall. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown introduced various statements made by
    the appellant to the emergency responders in <span class=GramE>which</span> the
    appellant described the accident and his efforts to help Ms. Pauls.  The appellant also performed a videotaped
    “walkthrough” for the police on December 5, 2003, in which he retraced his
    steps and described what had happened.  He gave a further audiotaped statement on March 21, 2004.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the videotaped walkthrough, the appellant told
    the police that when he heard Ms. Pauls scream, he immediately rushed back to
    the platform area where they had picnicked, looked down and saw her body.  The Crown led evidence that the body was only
    visible from the edge from which Ms. Pauls had fallen, which was on the other
    side of the outcropping.  The Crown
    argued to the jury that the appellant had inadvertently admitted that he was
    standing next to Ms. Pauls when she went over the edge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his testimony, the appellant explained that
    he had not meant to indicate to the police the exact location from which he saw
    the body in his videotaped walkthrough.  He
    testified that from wherever he stood on the rock after hearing the scream, he was
    able to see Ms. Pauls’ body.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the audiotaped statement, the appellant told
    the police that Ms. Pauls’ body was still moving down the hill when he ran to
    the edge of the rock and looked down.  The Crown argued that if the appellant was, as he claimed, on his way
    back up to the main trail when he heard the scream, he would not have had time
    to get back to the edge of the rock, look down and see the body while it was
    still rolling down the hill.  The Crown
    submitted that the appellant’s acknowledgement that he saw the body rolling
    down the hill was an admission that he was standing on the edge of the precipice
    when Ms. Pauls plunged to her death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to relying on some of the
    appellant’s statements as admissions, the Crown argued that the appellant was
    caught in several significant lies.  On
    the Crown’s theory, these lies demonstrated that Ms. Pauls’ death was the
    product of a plan formulated before the day of her death.  I will highlight some of the more significant
    lies that the Crown alleges the appellant told to the police and others.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his statements, the appellant indicated that
    he had scrambled down the very steep incline through the rocks, logs and underbrush
    to his wife’s body, sliding on his backside and legs as he made his way down
    the treacherous terrain.  None of the
    first responders who spoke with the appellant noticed any injuries, dishevelled
    clothing, or dirt on the appellant’s pants or backside.  To the contrary, his clothing appeared very
    clean.  The Crown maintained that the
    appellant’s pristine condition was inconsistent with someone who had scrambled
    down the steep incline in a panic, but was consistent with someone who, having reconnoitred
    the area the day before, was aware of the narrow path that led down from the
    rocky precipice to the area where Ms. Pauls’ body was ultimately found, and had
    carefully gone down that path.  It was
    the Crown’s theory that the appellant had chosen this site because that path
    offered a way down to the body, allowing the appellant to ensure that Ms. Pauls
    was dead before he went for help.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown also challenged the appellant’s
    assertion that when he was beside Ms. Pauls’ body, he saw the lights on what
    turned out to be Mr. Wiens’ house and ran towards them.  The Crown led evidence that the lights could
    not be seen from that location.  They
    could, however, be seen by someone standing on the top of the outcropping looking
    for a nearby home.  It was the Crown’s
    position that the appellant had done just that on his prior visit to the
    area.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant explained that he may have seen
    the lights while picnicking on top of the rock and subsequently went for help
    knowing in which direction to run.  There
    was also evidence that lights from homes near the Wiens’ home could be seen
    from the place where the body was found.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From the Crown's perspective, the most significant
    lie allegedly told by the appellant arose out of his repeated assertion that Ms.
    Pauls spoke to him when he reached her body.  The appellant told many people, including first responders, friends and,
    subsequently, police investigators that he spoke with his wife when he arrived
    at her side.  He gave testimony to the
    same effect.  According to his statements
    and testimony, his wife pleaded with him to go for help and he immediately did
    so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of the first responders to speak with the
    appellant at the scene testified that the appellant, in describing the fall and
    his attempt to help his wife, indicated that when he arrived by her side, “she
    was screaming at him, go get help, go get help”.  That same responder further testified that
    the appellant told her that he proceeded down the hill, through the difficult
    terrain to the Wiens’ residence where he called for help.  The appellant then indicated that he returned
    to his wife’s side.  According to this responder,
    the appellant told her that as he made his way back toward his wife’s body
    after getting help, “he could still hear her screaming”.  The appellant also told one of the paramedics
    on the scene that his wife was yelling at him to go for help when he reached
    her at the bottom of the cliff.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant described these same events on
    several other occasions to various people.  In some of those versions he described his wife as speaking only when he
    first arrived at her side and speaking in a low, almost inaudible voice.  The appellant gave that version in his
    testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown led expert medical evidence, which I
    need not detail, to the effect that Ms. Pauls’ spinal cord was in all
    likelihood completely severed in the fall and that, by the time the appellant could
    get down the hill to her, Ms. Pauls would not have been capable of saying
    anything.  A defence medical expert
    testified that the spinal cord may not have been entirely severed by the fall
    and that severance may have been completed in the efforts to either move or
    resuscitate Ms. Pauls.  The defence
    expert testified that if Ms. Pauls’ spine was not entirely severed, she may
    have been capable of speaking for a brief period of time after the fall.  On cross-examination, however, the defence
    expert agreed that the minimal amount of blood at various fracture sites was
    inconsistent with any sustained cardiac activity after the fall.  While it cannot be said that the defence
    expert conceded the correctness of the Crown expert’s opinion, his cross-examination
    moved him close to an acknowledgement that it was likely that the spinal cord
    was entirely severed by Ms. Pauls’ fall.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The expert medical testimony was potentially
    important.  If Ms. Pauls could not have
    spoken to the appellant at all, much less both when he arrived at her side and
    several minutes later when he returned after going for help, the jury could
    easily conclude that the appellant had fabricated these details of his
    narrative.  The Crown relied heavily on the
    expert medical evidence in support of its argument that the appellant was
    clearly lying about speaking to his wife as part of his effort to depict
    himself as a desperate husband at the scene of a terrible accident doing his
    best to help his stricken spouse.     </p>
  <h2>(c)       The

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant gave a statement to the police on
    November 23, 2003, after he was told that Ms. Pauls had died.  The statement was exculpatory.  The appellant appeared to be very upset both
    at the scene and later when he spoke to the police. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The next day, November 24, 2003, the appellant
    appeared at Ms. Veldmeyer’s home at 6:45 a.m.  He briefly described what had happened to Ms. Pauls.  He told Ms. Veldmeyer not to tell the police
    that he had been at her home should they call.  He told her that he might not be able to speak to her for a couple of
    weeks.  On that same day, the appellant spoke
    to several persons who were mutual friends of himself and Ms. Pauls.  According to them, the appellant seemed very
    upset.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also on November 24, 2003, the police learned from
    a relative of Ms. Pauls that the appellant may have been having an affair.  They went to the appellant’s home to speak
    with him.  A police officer asked the
    appellant if he had had an affair in the past or was currently having an affair.  The appellant lied and answered no to both inquiries.  When pressed, he admitted that he had seen
    Ms. Veldmeyer some two years earlier, but said that it was not an affair as he
    had only seen her “a few times”.  Later
    that same day, the appellant telephoned Ms. Veldmeyer on a borrowed cell phone.  He asked her to let him know if the police
    contacted her.  The police spoke to Ms.
    Veldmeyer later that day and arranged for her to attend at the police station
    on December 10, 2003.  Ms. Veldmeyer
    advised the appellant of the appointment.  The appellant asked to meet with her on the morning of December 10,
    2003, before her interview with the police.  She agreed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On December 5, 2003, the appellant voluntarily
    attended with the police at the homicide scene and walked through the events as
    he described them.  The walkthrough was
    videotaped.  The officers described the
    appellant as co-operative.  He answered all
    of the questions put to him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As arranged, the appellant met Ms. Veldmeyer on
    the morning of December 10, 2003.  By this
    time, the appellant was very concerned that he was under police surveillance.  He took evasive measures.  They met at an inn in Grimsby.  Ms. Veldmeyer left her car in the parking lot
    and got into the appellant’s vehicle.  They drove to St. Catharines and pulled over to the side of a road to
    talk.   The appellant did not want the
    police to know about the nature of his relationship with her.  He told Ms. Veldmeyer that she should tell
    the police that she and the appellant were only friends, and that she should minimize
    the amount of time that she had known him.  The appellant instructed her not to tell the police about their
    baby.  Ms. Veldmeyer could not understand
    why the appellant wanted her to lie to the police.  He told her that it was because she had
    nothing to do with Ms. Pauls’ death.  The
    appellant testified that he did not want to subject Ms. Veldmeyer to what he
    knew to be unwarranted suspicion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer met with the police and told them
    most of the lies that the appellant had told her to tell.  She did, however, tell the police that the
    appellant was the father of her child.  The appellant called her after the interview and asked what she had
    said.  Ms. Veldmeyer told him she could
    not recall word for word.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Ms. Veldmeyer resumed their
    relationship in December 2003.  By
    January 2004, they were seeing each other regularly and the appellant was
    anxious to have Ms. Veldmeyer and the baby spend more time in his home at 17
    Ivan Avenue.  He asked Ms. Veldmeyer to
    marry him and move into the home.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Veldmeyer testified that she felt pressured
    by the ongoing police investigation.  It
    also seemed to her that the appellant was attempting to control her.  On February 17, 2004, she went to the police
    and told them she had lied in her earlier statements.  She did not tell the appellant that she had
    gone to the police and told them the truth.  By the middle of March 2004, she had decided to end their
    relationship.  Ms. Veldmeyer ended their
    relationship in a telephone conversation on March 11, 2004.  The appellant was very upset, threatening
    suicide and also indicating that he would attempt to get custody of their daughter.  In the following days, the appellant
    repeatedly tried to get Ms. Veldmeyer to reconsider her decision.  He was also following her and making phone
    calls to her place of business.  </p>
  <h2>III.      THE ADMISSIBILITY OF MS. PAULS’ STATEMENTS
    TO HER FRIENDS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, the Crown sought to lead evidence to
    show the deterioration of the relationship between the appellant and Ms. Pauls
    in the weeks and months prior to her death.  The Crown relied on this evidence to demonstrate the appellant’s
    increasing animosity towards Ms. Pauls, his determination to extract himself
    from their relationship without losing his house, and Ms. Pauls’ fear of the
    appellant.  These facts were ultimately
    relevant to whether the appellant pushed Ms. Pauls to her death and, if so, his
    state of mind at that time and whether that act was planned and
    deliberate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown relied on evidence of statements made
    by the appellant, observations of the interactions between the appellant and
    Ms. Pauls, and statements made by Ms. Pauls to her friends Mr. and Mrs. Lutsch,
    Faye Vormittag, and Mary Armstrong.  In
    those statements, Ms. Pauls reported verbal and physical abuse by the appellant
    and threats that he made against her.  Ms.
    Pauls also said things that the Crown contended could justify the inference
    that Ms. Pauls was very afraid of the appellant in the weeks and months before
    her death.  The Crown submitted that the
    statements made by Ms. Pauls were admissible either under recognized hearsay
    exceptions (e.g. evidence of Ms. Pauls’ state of mind) or under the principled
    approach to the admissibility of hearsay evidence set out in the then leading
    authority of <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2
    S.C.R. 144.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, the defence did not oppose the
    admissibility of much of the evidence relied on by the Crown to show the
    appellant’s animus towards Ms. Pauls, her fear of him, and the deterioration of
    their relationship.  Counsel did,
    however, object to the admissibility of some of the statements made by Ms.
    Pauls to her friends.  Counsel argued
    that some statements should be excluded entirely and others should be edited
    before they were heard by the jury.  The
    trial judge held a pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>.  She ultimately admitted some of Ms. Pauls’
    statements and excluded others.  The
    trial judge gave extensive reasons for her ruling.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I understand counsel’s position on appeal, he
    takes issue with the admission of four of the statements made by Ms. Pauls.  In doing so, counsel relies primarily on the
    change in the law effected in <i>R. v.
    Khelawon</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, decided after the trial judge’s ruling.  Contrary to <i>Starr</i>, the authority that bound the trial judge, <i>Khelawon</i> permits a trial judge
    considering reliability for the purpose of determining the admissibility of
    hearsay evidence to look beyond the circumstances surrounding the making of the
    statements to extrinsic evidence that may support or undermine the reliability
    of the hearsay statements:  <i>Khelawon</i> at paras. 93-100. Counsel
    submits that extrinsic evidence becomes particularly significant where, as in
    this case, the Crown must rely on the inherent reliability of the hearsay
    statements rather than the existence of adequate substitutes for cross-examination
    of the declarant:  <i>Khelawon</i> at paras. 106-108.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant is entitled to rely on <i>Khelawon</i> to challenge the correctness of
    the trial judge’s ruling even though the law as set down in <i>Khelawon</i> is inconsistent in one material
    respect with the law the trial judge was obligated to apply at trial:  see, for example,  <i>R. v. T.R.</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.); <i>R. v.
    S.(S.)</i> (2008), 232 C.C.C. (3d) 158 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 24; <i>R. v. Sharif</i> (2009), 275 B.C.A.C. 171
    (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 33460 (April 29, 2010).  Superimposing the law as set down in <i>Khelawon</i> on the trial record does,
    however, create some difficulties on appeal.  The appellant must demonstrate reversible error on the trial record and
    on the evidence heard on the <i>voir dire</i> conducted to determine the admissibility of Ms. Pauls’ statements.  This court cannot speculate as to what the evidentiary
    record might have been had <i>Khelawon</i> been in play at the time of the <i>voir dire</i>.  Nor can this court sift through evidence
    heard on the trial proper, after the statements had been admitted, and extract from
    the trial evidence bits and pieces of evidence that under the <i>Khelawon</i> analysis might support an
    argument for or against the reliability of Ms. Pauls’ statements.  Although <i>Khelawon</i> extends the scope of the reliability inquiry when hearsay statements are
    offered in evidence, it still maintains the distinction between the reliability
    of those statements for the purposes of admissibility and the ultimate
    reliability of the statements for the purpose of determining whether the Crown
    has proved its case:  <i>R. v. Blackman</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 298 at
    paras. 56-57<span class=GramE>.  The</span> correctness of the trial judge’s ruling cannot turn on this court’s assessment
    of the reliability of Ms. Pauls’ statements based on a review of the entirety
    of the trial record.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, both the appellant and the Crown must
    take the <i>voir dire</i> record as it
    exists.  The appellant bears the onus of
    showing that, on that record and on the law as it stands post-<span
class=GramE><i>Khelawon</i>,</span> the
    trial judge erred in admitting the hearsay statements made by Ms. Pauls.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    engaged in by the trial judge when determining the admissibility of Ms. Pauls’
    statements, I would still defer to her findings of fact and her weighing of the
    various factors that she did consider: see <i>R.
    v. Couture</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517 at para. 81, <i>per</i> Charron J., and at para. 132, <i>per</i> Rothstein J., dissenting on another point; <i>R. v. Duong</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d) 515 (C.A.) at para. 54; <i>R. v. Moo</i> (2009), 247 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Ont.
    C.A.) at para. 101; <i>S<span class=GramE>.(</span>S.)</i> at paras. 29-30. The consideration of extrinsic evidence where appropriate, as mandated
    by <i>Khelawon</i>, does not justify a <i>de novo</i> assessment of admissibility on
    appeal, but does mandate a consideration of that extrinsic evidence as an
    additional factor to be examined in the context of the assessment made by the
    trial judge of the other factors relevant to the reliability of the statements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge made several significant
    findings of fact.  She found that Ms.
    Pauls was very close to the persons with whom she shared these very personal and
    embarrassing details about her relationship with the appellant.  The trial judge also found that the
    statements were spontaneous and made at a time close to the events described in
    the statements.  The trial judge further
    found that Ms. Pauls’ emotional state when she made the statements was
    consistent with their reliability and that the detail provided in some of the
    statements was significant.  All of these
    findings were available on the evidence and I accept them for the purpose of
    determining whether, in light of <i>Khelawon</i>,
    the trial judge erred in law by admitting the statements.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first of the four statements challenged by
    the appellant was allegedly made by Ms. Pauls to her friend, Faye Vormittag, in
    the summer of 2003.  Ms. Vormittag
    testified that Ms. Pauls telephoned her.  She was very upset and told Ms. Vormittag that the appellant had thrown
    her into the refrigerator so forcefully that she fell to the ground.  When Ms. Vormittag urged Ms. Pauls to leave
    the appellant, Ms. Pauls indicated that she was afraid of the appellant.  Ms. Pauls said to Ms. Vormittag, “Faye, if
    anything happens to me you’ve got to promise me you’ll go to the police.” Ms.
    Vormittag promised she would do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no merit to the argument that this
    evidence should have been excluded.  In
    her ruling on the admissibility of this particular statement, reported at
    [2006] O.J. No. 4757 (S.C.), the trial judge said at para. 95: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The defence acknowledges necessity and threshold
    reliability, and acknowledges that given the time frame, and the direct
    relationship to the issues of the state of mind of Ms. Pauls and the escalating
    tension between them at this time, the evidence is properly before the jury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As explained in <i>R. v. Griffin</i> (2009), 244 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at paras. 59-64,
    a case involving a very similar ante-mortem statement, the evidence of Ms.
    Pauls’ statement was direct evidence of Ms. Pauls’ fear of the appellant, indirect
    evidence of his animosity and motive and ultimately, along with other evidence,
    indirect evidence that the appellant pushed Ms. Pauls to her death. Counsel on
    appeal has not pointed to anything in the trial record that would justify
    ignoring the express concession as to reliability made at trial.  Given that express concession, it cannot be
    argued that the trial judge erred in holding that the statement was sufficiently
    reliable to warrant its admission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second statement challenged on appeal was
    made by Ms. Pauls to her friend, Mary Armstrong.  Ms. Armstrong indicated that she spoke to Ms.
    Pauls in August 2003.  They discussed the
    relationship between Ms. Pauls and the appellant.  In the course of the conversation, Ms. Pauls
    said, &quot;[I]f anything ever happens, like an accident, call the police. Promise
    me.&quot;  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The statement made to Ms. Armstrong is very
    similar to that made to Ms. Vormittag.  Both statements were made at around the same time.  The statement to Ms. Armstrong is relevant to
    the same issues as the similar statement made to Ms. Vormittag.  Not surprisingly, given that the defence
    conceded the admissibility of virtually the same statement made to Ms.
    Vormittag, the defence also conceded the admissibility of the statement made to
    Ms. Armstrong.  I therefore see no merit
    in an argument that the statement to Ms. Armstrong was not sufficiently
    reliable to justify its admission.  It
    was properly received.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What I characterize as the third statement challenged
    by the appellant is in reality two very similar statements made on different
    occasions to Mr. and Mrs. Lutsch, both very close friends of Ms. Pauls and the
    appellant.  Ms. Lutsch testified that in
    late October or November 2003, Ms. Pauls told her that she slept with a machete
    by her bed.  This statement was made
    during a conversation in which a very upset Ms. Pauls described to Ms. Lutsch a
    serious assault on her by the appellant.  When Ms. Lutsch urged Ms. Pauls to leave the appellant, Ms. Pauls responded
    with the comment concerning the machete.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  The Crown argued that the evidence of this
    statement demonstrated Ms. Pauls’ fear of the appellant at a time very
    proximate to her death.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Lutsch agreed in cross-examination on the <i>voir dire</i> that she could not be certain whether
    Ms. Pauls was being literal or melodramatic when she said that she slept with a
    machete beside her bed.  Ms. Pauls could
    be quite melodramatic when speaking about her relationship with the
    appellant.  Ms. Pauls owned an ornamental
    machete that her mother had given her.  There was no other evidence that Ms. Pauls kept that machete in her
    bedroom.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Lutsch also testified that Ms. Pauls told
    him that she slept with a machete by her bed.  His evidence as to when this statement was made was unclear.  According to him, it may have been as early
    as 2001, over two years before the homicide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded that the statements
    concerning the machete were sufficiently reliable to justify their admission as
    evidence of Ms. Pauls’ fear of the appellant.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  I do not think she erred in so holding.  Certainly, the statement to Ms. Lutsch was
    made in circumstances that provided ample grounds for a finding that the
    statement was a reliable indication of Ms. Pauls’ state of mind.  I see nothing by way of extrinsic evidence
    referred to on the <i>voir dire</i> that
    would warrant a different assessment of the reliability of the statements made
    to Ms. Lutsch.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Pauls’ statement to Mr. Lutsch had little
    probative value with respect to her state of mind at the time of her
    death.  That statement could have been excluded.  However, given the properly admitted
    evidence, the admission of the statement could not possibly have prejudiced the
    appellant’s case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fourth statement challenged by the appellant
    arose from the same exchange with Ms. Lutsch in which Ms. Pauls referred to
    sleeping with a machete by her bed.  Ms.
    Lutsch testified that Ms. Pauls sobbed hysterically during that conversation,
    which occurred in late October or November of 2003.  She told Ms. Lutsch that she and the
    appellant had had “a huge fight”.  The
    appellant had pushed her into a refrigerator.  He had also put a knife to her throat.<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Ms. Lutsch urged Ms. Pauls to leave the home;
    however, Ms. Pauls replied that she was afraid that the appellant would “find
    me and he’ll kill me”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Lutsch testified on the <i>voir dire</i> that Ms. Pauls could be “awfully melodramatic”.  Ms. Lutsch testified that she was never sure
    whether Ms. Pauls was exaggerating when she described the appellant’s conduct.  Ms. Lutsch indicated that the day after Ms.
    Pauls had told her about the confrontation with the <span class=GramE>appellant,</span> Ms. Lutsch had called Ms. Pauls to see if she was alright.  Ms. Pauls did not refer to any difficulties
    with the appellant, but indicated that she and appellant had gone shopping for
    the appellant’s mother.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite Ms. Lutsch’s uncertainty about the
    accuracy of Ms. Pauls’ comments, she was sufficiently concerned that she spoke
    to the appellant about the allegation concerning the knife.   Ms. Lutsch
    testified on the <i>voir dire</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[S]o in order to verify that that was actually the
    truth I said to Mike [the appellant], ‘Mike, did you really hold a knife to her
    throat?’ and he said, ‘Well I was peeling a potato’ – or slicing some sausage
    or something like that.  He didn’t deny
    he had a knife.  He didn’t deny he held
    it to her throat, but he kind of explained why he had a knife in his hand at
    that point.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that had the trial judge
    considered extrinsic evidence beyond the circumstances in which the statement
    was made to Ms. Lutsch, she would have concluded that the statement was not
    sufficiently reliable to justify its admission.  Counsel submits that had cross-examination been possible, Ms. Pauls may
    have conceded that she never expected her words to be repeated in a courtroom,
    and that she had invented a dramatic story about a knife because she was upset
    with the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The most telling piece of extrinsic evidence adduced
    on the <i>voir dire</i> and properly
    considered under the <i>Khelawon</i> approach is the appellant’s reaction when Ms. Lutsch confronted him with Ms.
    Pauls' allegation.  The appellant’s
    reaction is capable of being interpreted as an admission that something
    happened in the course of an argument between him and Ms. Pauls that involved a
    knife and that the appellant knew Ms. Pauls had interpreted as a threat.  If Ms. Pauls’ statement to Ms. Lutsch was untrue
    and had no basis in reality, the appellant would not have reacted to the
    allegation by referring to a specific discussion he had had with Ms. Pauls during
    which he held a knife in his hand.  The
    appellant’s response suggests that he was very aware of the event that Ms.
    Pauls recounted to Ms. Lutsch.  The appellant’s
    reaction tends to support the trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. Pauls’
    statement concerning the threat with the knife was sufficiently trustworthy to
    warrant its admission.  I see no error in
    the trial judge’s ruling.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel submits that apart entirely from the
    error arising out of the change in the law effected by <i>Khelawon</i>, the trial judge erred in using the absence of evidence
    that Ms. Pauls had a motive to lie when making her statements as evidence of
    the reliability of those statements.  This
    submission arises out of the trial judge’s comment at para. 54 of her reasons
    that &quot;[t]here has in this case not been shown any motive to lie on the
    part of Ms. Pauls&quot;.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that in this
    passage, the trial judge erred in equating the absence of evidence of motive
    with the existence of evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that
    Ms. Pauls did not have a motive.  The
    distinction relied on by the appellant was drawn in <i>R. v. Czibulka</i> (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 199 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 44,
    and referred to in <i>Blackman</i>.  Counsel further contends that in any event,
    there was ample evidence that Ms. Pauls had a motive to lie to her friends to
    put the appellant in a bad light.  Counsel submits that the deteriorating nature of their relationship and
    their pending break-up provided that motive.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s words at para. 54 of her
    reasons must be read in conjunction with the immediately preceding paragraphs
    and analysis.  At paras. 47-53, the trial
    judge considered the circumstances in which the statements were made and identified
    several factors that rendered the statements reliable.  The trial judge’s observation at para. 54 <span
class=GramE>was</span> nothing more than a comment on the state of the
    evidence.  There was nothing in the
    evidence to suggest a motive to lie.   Such evidence, had it existed, could have countered
    the indicia of reliability enumerated by the trial judge in the immediately
    preceding paragraphs.  The absence of
    evidence of a motive to lie, while obviously of significantly less probative
    value than evidence that the declarant had no motive to lie, is still part of
    the overall evidentiary picture to be assessed when determining the reliability
    of the hearsay statement.  In this case,
    the absence of any evidence of a motive to lie left the probative worth of the
    indicia of reliability referred to by the trial judge unimpaired. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would also reject the submission that there
    was evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> that
    Ms. Pauls had a motive to lie to her friends about the appellant’s abuse.  Counsel’s argument comes down to the contention
    that because the relationship was failing, Ms. Pauls must have had a motive to
    lie about the appellant’s conduct.  This
    argument is based on a generalized assumption about failing relationships
    rather than any specific evidence heard on this <i>voir dire</i>.  A similar argument
    in a factually similar case was rejected by this court in <i>R. v. Pasqualino</i> (2008), 233 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (Ont. C.A.) at paras.
    41-43.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the <i>voir
    dire</i> record, it was open to counsel to argue that the deteriorating nature
    of the relationship between Ms. Pauls and the appellant could give rise to
    suspicions about the truthfulness of the allegations made against the appellant
    by Ms. Pauls in her statements.  It was,
    however, for the trial judge to decide whether those suspicions were justified
    in the circumstances revealed by the evidence.  She concluded, having regard to the entirety of the circumstances in
    which the statements were made, that the deteriorating nature of their
    relationship did not constitute a motive on Ms. Pauls’ part to lie to her
    friends.  That assessment, which is
    essentially a factual one, cannot be characterized as unreasonable.  Nor is it tainted by any material
    misapprehension of the evidence.  I think
    this court must defer to that assessment of the evidence by the trial judge.  </p>
  <h2>IV. THE ALLEGED MISDIRECTION AS TO THE EVIDENTIARY USES OF STATEMENTS MADE
    BY THE APPELLANT</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As summarized above, the appellant made various
    statements to first responders, friends, and police investigators concerning
    the circumstances of Ms. Pauls’ death.  The
    statements were exculpatory and the defence relied on them to support its
    position that Ms. Pauls’ death was an accident.  The Crown also relied on portions of those statements, contending that
    they contained lies that were capable of supporting the Crown’s position that
    the appellant had fabricated a story in an effort to hide the fact that he had
    pushed his wife from the cliff.  Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge’s instructions were inadequate
    both with respect to the potential exculpatory value of the statements and the
    potential inculpatory use of parts of the statements as circumstantial evidence
    of guilt.  I will address the alleged
    error relating to the exculpatory use of the statements first.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel submits that the trial judge failed to
    clearly instruct the jury that the exculpatory portions of the appellant’s
    statements were potentially important evidence for the defence.  Counsel contends that while the trial judge
    referred at length to the appellant’s testimony, she did not refer to the
    exculpatory portions of his statements made shortly after Ms. Pauls’
    death.  Counsel argues that the
    exculpatory statements made at the time of Ms. Pauls’ death were potentially
    more credible than testimony given many months after the fact.  He submits that the trial judge’s failure to
    specifically allude to the statements and their potential exculpatory value
    constitutes reversible error.</p>

    Criminal Evidence</i>, 4th ed., looseleaf (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2003)
    at para. 7:160.10.   I cannot accept the
    contention that the trial judge did not make this clear to the jury.  First, in her instruction as to the use to be
    made of out-of-court statements, she told the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Things found to be said by an accused person are

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later, the trial judge told the jury that it
    must acquit if it believed “Mr. Polimac and the evidence that supports the
    defence position” or if it had a reasonable doubt based on the evidence of Mr.
    Polimac “or the evidence that supports his position”.  It could not have been lost on the jury that
    the appellant’s exculpatory statements and explanations constituted evidence
    that, if believed, “supports the defence position”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge reviewed the substance of the
    many statements made by the appellant at the scene and in subsequent days and
    weeks.  At the outset of her review, she
    reminded the jury that it was the defence position that “all of Mr. Polimac’s
    actions at the scene are entirely consistent with a sudden accidental
    fall”.  The appellant’s description of
    his actions at the scene came not only from his testimony, but from his
    statements.  Finally, in reviewing the
    position of the defence at the end of her instructions, the trial judge once
    again made it clear that the defence relied on the consistency of the
    appellant’s description of the relevant events from the day of the event
    through to trial as indicative of the truthfulness of that version of events.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge gave counsel a full copy of her
    proposed charge to the jury before that charge was delivered.  Counsel vetted those instructions and in
    extensive submissions recommended various changes.  Counsel took no objection to the manner in
    which the trial judge proposed to deal with the exculpatory value of the out-of-court
    statements.  I have no doubt that, had the
    instructions been capable of being read as appellate counsel would read them,
    trial counsel would have raised an objection.  Counsel’s acquiescence to the instructions, particularly after having
    been given a full opportunity to raise any perceived shortcomings in the trial
    judge’s instructions, must be given considerable weight when considering an
    objection raised for the first time on appeal that, in effect, argues that the jury
    instructions significantly undermined the defence position vigorously advanced
    at trial: see <i>R. v. Royz</i>, [2009] 1
    S.C.R. 423 at para. 3; <i>R. v. Ellard</i> (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 183 (S.C.C.) at para. 47.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn next to counsel’s submission that the
    trial judge failed to adequately instruct the jury as to the preconditions to
    the jury’s use of any part of the appellant’s out-of-court statements as
    evidence of his guilt.  Counsel submits
    that the trial judge failed to draw the important distinction between the
    jury’s rejection of those statements as false and the jury’s use of those
    statements as evidence of fabrication from which to infer guilt.  Counsel contends that the trial judge failed
    to make it clear to the jury that before the statements had any value to the
    Crown’s case, the jury must find that they were deliberately false and must
    further find from circumstances other than those demonstrating the falsity of
    the statements that the statements were fabricated to avoid liability.  The distinction that counsel contends was not
    made clear to the jury can be difficult to appreciate and has generated a great
    deal of appellate ink:  see <i>R. v. Hibbert</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445; <i>R. v. Coutts</i> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545
    (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> (2002), 62
    O.R. (3d) 263 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Samuels</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R.
    v. Tessier</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 538 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Tanasichuk</i> (2007), 227 C.C.C. (3d) 446 (N.B.C.A.).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>O’Connor</i> is the leading authority in this province.  After restating and explaining, at paras. 17-20, the rationale for
    drawing a distinction between disbelief of an accused’s testimony or
    out-of-court statements, which has no inherent evidentiary value, and a finding
    that the testimony or statements were fabricated to avoid culpability, which is
    circumstantial evidence of guilt, the court examined the circumstances in which
    the inference of fabrication to avoid culpability could be drawn by the trier
    of fact.  At paras. 22-24, O’Connor
    A.C.J.O. drew an important and helpful distinction, for the purposes of drawing
    the inference of fabrication, between the testimony of an accused and
    out-of-court statements of an accused.  With respect to out-of-court statements by an accused, O’Connor A.C.J.O.
    said at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>I am satisfied that it is open to a trier of fact
    to consider evidence of the circumstances in which an accused made an
    out-of-court statement which is disbelieved as independent evidence to show
    that the accused fabricated the statement.</u>  The difference in approach to disbelieved testimony and disbelieved
    out-of-court statements turns both on the policy reasons underlying the
    requirement for independent evidence of fabrication as well as on the potential
    evidentiary value of the circumstances in which the two types of statements are
    made.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was not argued at trial or on appeal that the
    statements made by the appellant to the first responders at the scene, the
    police on the day Ms. Pauls died, or to his friends shortly afterwards, were
    not, if proven to be false, potentially capable of supporting the inference of
    deliberate fabrication to avoid detection.<a

    found to be deliberately false, the proximity of many of the statements to Ms.
    Pauls’ death, the detailed and precise narrative set out in the statements, the
    persons to whom the statements were made, and the fact that the appellant was
    not under any suspicion when the statements were made, taken together, provide
    a basis to infer deliberate fabrication to avoid liability:  see <i>Tanasichuk</i> at para. 65; <i>Samuels</i> at paras. 38-39; <i>O’Connor</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant, relying on <i>O’Connor</i> at paras. 34-46, submits that
    the trial judge’s instructions were inadequate.  He submits that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that a
    finding that parts of the statements were inaccurate or even deliberately
    false, standing alone, did not constitute any evidence of the appellant’s
    guilt.  Counsel further contends that the
    trial judge failed to tell the jury that before they used any deliberate
    falsehoods as evidence of guilt, they had to infer that the appellant lied in
    order to mislead the police and avoid culpability.  Finally, counsel argues that the trial judge
    failed to outline and properly limit the body of evidence that the jury could
    rely on when determining whether the Crown had demonstrated that the statements
    were fabricated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not follow the <i>O’Connor</i> model in her instructions.  She was not asked to do so by counsel for the
    Crown or the appellant.  Instead, the
    trial judge approached the out-of-court statements and the use the jury might
    make of them as one of several factual issues to be addressed by the jury in
    arriving at its verdict.  The trial judge
    thoroughly summarized the evidence relating to the statements and explained to
    the jury, in a balanced manner, the competing inferences that the defence and
    Crown urged upon the jury.  Certainly,
    the alleged lies in the appellant’s out-of-court statements were not given any
    prominence in the trial judge’s instructions.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not act unilaterally in
    putting the issue to the jury as she did.  As I have already indicated, the trial judge prepared a draft copy of
    her entire instructions, gave it to counsel and invited comments.  In the course of a lengthy colloquy, trial
    counsel for the appellant (not counsel on appeal) took no exception to the
    manner in which the trial judge proposed to deal with the appellant’s
    out-of-court statements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is becoming much more common for trial judges
    to provide counsel with copies of their proposed instructions and to give
    counsel an opportunity to comment on those instructions before they are
    delivered.  In that context, counsel is
    in a much different position than counsel who is called upon to object after
    hearing the instructions for the first time as they are delivered to the jury.  It is hardly accurate to describe the
    position of trial counsel who makes no objection after being given a full
    opportunity to vet and comment on the jury instructions before they are
    delivered as a “failure to object”.  Counsel’s
    duty to assist the court in fulfilling its obligation to properly instruct the
    jury, referred to by Fish J. in <i>R. v.
    Khela</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104 at para. 49, takes on added significance where
    counsel has been given a full copy of the proposed instructions and an ample
    opportunity to vet them, and has engaged in a detailed pre-trial dialogue with
    the trial judge.  In those circumstances,
    counsel’s position at trial becomes very important when evaluating complaints, raised
    for the first time on appeal, that matters crucial to the defence were not
    properly addressed by the trial judge in her instructions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s position at trial is of course not
    determinative when misdirection or non-direction is raised as a ground of
    appeal.  A legal error remains a legal
    error even if counsel does not object or even supports the erroneous
    instruction:  see <i>R. v. Wright</i> (2009), 98 O.R. (3d) 665 (C.A.) at para. 27; <i>R. v. Van</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716 at para.
    43.  Jury instructions, particularly
    about the manner in which juries may consider parts of the evidence, are not,
    however, designed to formulate legal principles for the jury or offer abstract
    verbalizations of those principles.  Jury
    instructions about the evidence must ensure the following: first, that the jury
    understands how the evidence can and cannot be used in the context of the
    particular case; and second, that the jury understands the positions taken by
    the defence and Crown with respect to that evidence.  Counsel’s considered position after examining
    the proposed instruction sheds valuable light on whether that proposed
    instruction met those two goals.  This
    instruction did.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is necessary to summarize the structure of
    the trial judge’s instructions to make the point that her treatment of the
    out-of-court statements was appropriate in the circumstances.  The trial judge began her instructions by
    explaining several legal principles that applied to the evidence the jury had
    heard.  The trial judge explained the
    evidentiary use that could be made of the appellant’s out-of-court
    statements.  She said nothing about the
    potential use of any parts of the statements as evidence from which the jury
    could infer fabrication to avoid culpability.  In light of the remainder of the charge, the
    absence of that instruction could do no damage to the appellant’s case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also instructed the jury on the
    circumstantial use it could make of certain after-the-fact conduct by the
    appellant.  The trial judge directed the
    jury to parts of the evidence that it could consider to be after-the-fact
    conduct capable of supporting an inference of guilt.  The trial judge did not include in this
    catalogue of evidence any of the appellant’s out-of-court statements concerning
    the events surrounding Ms. Pauls’ death.  She could have.  The absence of
    any reference to the appellant’s out-of-court statements concerning the events
    surrounding Ms. Pauls’ death as potentially constituting after-the-fact conduct
    enured to the appellant’s benefit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the second part of her instructions, the trial judge outlined the essential
    elements of the offence and explained to the jury without elaboration the areas
    of the evidence that were relevant to each element of the offence.  She told the jury that the appellant’s
    out-of-court statements could provide evidence of his state of mind as it
    related both to his intention, and planning and deliberation.  Once again, she said nothing about the
    potential of finding that certain parts of those statements were fabricated, or
    the possible use that could be made of any such fabrication.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the next part of her instructions, the trial judge grouped and summarized the
    evidence under several categories.  The
    appellant’s out-of-court statements were one such category.  The trial judge referred to the Crown’s
    contention that parts of the out-of-the court statements were false and therefore
    reflective of the appellant’s plan to kill Ms. Pauls and make it appear to have
    been an accident.  The trial judge set
    out some of the deliberate falsehoods alleged by the Crown.    She explained
    the respective positions of the defence and Crown.  For example, when dealing with the issue of
    whether Ms. Pauls spoke to the appellant before she died at the bottom of the
    cliff, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown, of course, argues that she suffered a
    rapid death and could not speak at all.  The Crown suggests you will find that Mr. Polimac’s account that she
    could speak is manufactured to make it appear that he wanted to get help,
    whereas his actual purpose was to confirm her death before he went to notify
    anyone, so there was no risk that she could explain what happened.  The defence argues that the evidence is quite
    inconclusive on this point of whether she could speak, so you should not find
    that Mr. Polimac was wrong about her talking, but should accept his evidence
    that he did rush off to get her help in hopes that she would survive.  The defence also argued that it may have been
    that in his traumatized state he believed that he heard her ask for help when
    in fact she said nothing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge followed this summary of the respective arguments with a detailed
    and accurate review of the relevant medical evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded her instructions with a full and balanced summary of the
    respective positions of the Crown and defence.  In the course of that summary, she outlined the Crown and the defence
    position with respect to the alleged falsehoods in the appellant’s out-of-court
    statements.  In summarizing the Crown’s
    case, she said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Polimac’s account of what he does after Ms.
    Pauls goes over the ledge is not a genuine account but rather a false story he
    prepared in advance to make it appear he offered assistance to Ms. Pauls.  Mr. Polimac says he scrambles down the <span
class=GramE>gully, that Ms. Pauls speaks to him,</span> that he moves her five
    to 10 feet.  These claims are refuted by
    the physical evidence: his clean clothes belie any account of sliding down the
    gully on his back, bum and hands and then trying to move Ms. Pauls backwards
    down the escarpment on his knees.  The
    expert evidence concerning brain and brain stem injuries suffered by Ms. Pauls
    forecloses the possibility that she speaks to him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summarizing the defence position, the trial judge outlined the following
    argument:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown’s argument that Mr. Polimac “enticed” her
    is speculation.  The Crown makes much of
    the inconsistencies in Mr. Polimac’s recollections of the event.  However, the following can be said:  his initial memory could be expected to be
    impaired by the trauma of the event; and the statements recalled by various
    witnesses at the scene are inconsistent.  The defence argued that most likely from the confusion of the event, and
    with the lack of proper note taking, the various on scene people remembered
    differently.  The three statements to the
    police are cumulative.  The recital of
    events given on November 23rd is brief.  On December 5th, Mr. Polimac can be expected to be reluctant to relive
    the events in detail in the place where it occurred shortly before.  On March 21st, he gives a more complete
    account which is consistent with the evidence given at trial, except that he
    continues to try to hide his relationship with Ms. Veldmeyer.                </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The defence argues that the evidence about how clean
    Mr. Polimac’s clothing was is irrational.  Clearly, he walked repeatedly in the rough and muddy area.  He must have soiled his clothing.  Either the observations of the rescue
    witnesses were inaccurate, or else Mr. Polimac flew over the ground, as the
    defence suggested to one of the witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the evidence adduced in this case, the real issue insofar as the out-of-court
    statements was concerned was whether the appellant had deliberately lied to the
    first responders, police officers and others concerning the circumstances
    surrounding Ms. Pauls’ death.  If the
    jury was satisfied that he did lie on significant matters - for example,
    whether Ms. Pauls spoke to him - the circumstances in which those lies were
    told made an inference of fabrication to avoid culpability very strong.  The trial judge, in keeping with the arguments
    advanced at trial, focussed on whether there were inaccuracies in the
    statements and, if so, whether any of those inaccuracies should be found by the
    jury to be deliberate falsehoods.  The
    trial judge made the respective positions of the defence and Crown on these
    issues clear to the jury.  In doing so,
    she fairly and fully put the case advanced at trial to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    legal analysis advanced by counsel on appeal is faithful to the case law and,
    in particular, <i>O’Connor</i>.  The trial judge could have given an
    instruction following the <i>O’Connor</i> model.  The question on appeal, however,
    is not whether an <i>O’Connor</i> instruction would have been appropriate, but whether the instruction given prejudiced
    the appellant’s right to a fair trial.  I
    do not think it did.  The issue arising
    out of the alleged falsehoods told by the appellant was left to the jury as
    counsel wanted it left to the jury.  An
    instruction replicating the <i>O’Connor</i> analysis would not, in my view, have improved the position of the defence.  To the contrary, an instruction that
    highlighted the circumstances that would support a finding of fabrication were the
    jury to find inaccuracies in the appellant’s statements may well have only
    emphasized the powerful case to be made for fabrication in the circumstances of
    this case.</p>
  <h2>V.        THE EVIDENTIARY VALUE OF
    CERTAIN AFTER-THE-FACT CONDUCT</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in leaving the evidence of the
    appellant’s expressed desire to have Ms. Pauls’ body cremated and his indication
    that there should be no death notice placed in the paper as evidence that could
    support the Crown’s contention that the appellant murdered Ms. Pauls.  The appellant submits that this evidence was not
    reasonably capable of supporting any inference that could assist the Crown and
    takes on a sinister connotation only if one begins from the premise that the appellant
    killed his wife.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    advancing this submission, counsel notes that the appellant knew that an
    autopsy would be conducted before any cremation occurred and that he made no
    objection to the autopsy.  Counsel
    further highlights the evidence that when Ms. Pauls’ family expressed a
    preference for a funeral and a burial, the appellant readily agreed.  Finally, counsel refers to the evidence that
    the appellant spoke of Ms. Pauls’ death to many friends and relatives and that,
    despite his expressed desire that there be no death notice, he placed a death
    notice in the paper when a friend told him that there were many people who
    would want to pay their respects if made aware of Ms. Pauls’ death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Evidence
    of things done by an accused after an alleged offence (after-the-fact conduct)
    is a type of circumstantial evidence.  Its evidentiary value to the Crown’s case depends on the inferences that
    can be drawn from the evidence as a matter of human experience and common
    sense.  In considering what inferences
    can properly be drawn, the evidence must of course be placed in the context of
    the entire case:  <i>R. v. Figueroa</i> (2008), 232 C.C.C. (3d) 51 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 33; <i>R. v. Allen</i> (2009), 249 C.C.C. (3d) 296
    (Alta. C.A.) at para. 68.  The evidence relied
    on by counsel for the appellant goes a long way to neutralizing any adverse
    inference that the jury might, as a matter of common sense and human experience,
    draw from the appellant’s desire to have Ms. Pauls cremated and his initial
    reluctance to place any notification of her death in the paper.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge dealt with this evidence in the context of other evidence involving
    the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct, particularly his attempt to keep his
    relationship with Ms. Veldmeyer from the police.  The trial judge made it clear to the jury
    that it was for them to determine what inference, if any, should be drawn from
    the appellant’s conduct after Ms. Pauls’ death.  The trial judge reminded the jury of the arguments put to them by both
    the Crown and the defence.  After
    summarizing the evidence relating to the possible cremation and the death
    notice, the trial judge referred to the evidence counsel for the appellant has
    summarized as neutralizing any potential adverse inference from that evidence.  The trial judge then went on to tell the jury,
    &quot;Since Mr. Polimac did readily agree to the family’s wishes, you perhaps
    will not put much if any weight on this part of the evidence, but it is for you
    to decide.&quot;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the state of the evidence by the end of the case, the trial judge might well
    have withdrawn the evidence entirely from the jury had she been asked to do
    so.  However, absent any submission by
    trial counsel that the evidence had no probative value, the trial judge cannot
    be faulted for the approach she took.  She briefly, but accurately summarized the evidence and the respective
    positions of the parties.  She then advanced
    an opinion that the evidence had little value.  I am confident that the jury, using its common
    sense and aided by a judicial nudge, would not have ascribed any weight to this
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the
    inference that could be drawn from certain comments made by the appellant at
    Ms. Pauls’ graveside on March 14 and 21, 2004.  The appellant attended the graveside by himself on those dates.  In two soliloquies, he told Ms. Pauls that he
    loved her and missed her.  According to
    the appellant, he was unaware that his communications at the graveside were
    being surreptitiously intercepted by the police under a judicial order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Veldmeyer had told the appellant that she wanted to terminate their
    relationship shortly before March 14, 2004.  The appellant was upset by that turn of events and the prospect of not
    seeing his baby daughter.  He was also very
    much aware that he was a suspect in Ms. Pauls’ death and was under police
    surveillance.  On any theory of the case,
    things were not working out for the appellant when he went to Ms. Pauls’

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence of the graveside visits while discussing the surveillance
    evidence.  After briefly summarizing the graveside
    visit evidence, she said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown might say that you will find Mr. Polimac
    was aware or suspicious about surveillance especially since Ms. Veldmeyer had
    warned him on March 11th, but the defence would say that this supports his
    innocence because there is nothing to suggest anything other than continuing grief.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge repeated the defence position with respect to the comments at the
    graveside when reviewing the position of the defence later in her charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    though the Crown at trial did not argue that the appellant may have been
    concerned about surveillance at the graveside, I see no error in this instruction.  The trial judge accurately reviewed the
    evidence and correctly observed that the appellant was conscious of police
    surveillance during that time period.  The
    trial judge did not suggest that any comments made at the graveside had any
    inculpatory value.  She simply reminded
    the jury in the context of the topic she was discussing – the surveillance
    evidence – that as of the date the appellant made the comments at the
    graveside, he was concerned about ongoing police surveillance.  </p>

    instructions concerning the statements allegedly made by the deceased.  The crux of the complaint is that the trial
    judge should have done more to caution the jury against the misuse of that
    evidence both because of its inherent frailties and because of specific dangers
    associated with the statements admitted by the trial judge.  Counsel did not advance these submissions in
    oral argument but also did not abandon them.  In my view, these arguments cannot succeed and I do not propose to
    address them beyond this note.  While the
    trial judge could have said many of the things the appellant submits she should
    have said, her failure to do so does not render what she said wrong or make the
    charge unfair.  None of the objections
    were made at trial.</p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[2]</span></span></span></a> I would not entirely foreclose an appellant from resorting to parts of the
    trial record to show the unreliability of the hearsay evidence where the trial
    decision predates <i>Khelawon</i>.  However, the appellant would be required to
    demonstrate that it was in the interests of justice to go beyond the four
    corners of the <i>voir dire</i> to assess
    the correctness of the evidentiary ruling. </p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[3]</span></span></span></a> The admissibility of the rest of this statement is also challenged.  I have described this as the fourth statement
    challenged by the appellant:  see paras.
    73-77.</p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[4]</span></span></span></a> Although not argued, it may be that the statement was admissible as evidence of
    her fear of the appellant even if not literally true.  Even if intended figuratively, the statement
    could still evince a very real fear of the appellant.</p>

<div id=ftn5>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref5"

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[5]</span></span></span></a> It is not entirely clear on the <i>voir dire</i> record whether these two incidents took place during a single confrontation
    between the appellant and Ms. Pauls, or whether the incidents were reported to
    Ms. Lutsch in a single conversation.  In
    cross-examination, Ms. Lutsch appears to indicate that the incidents occurred
    and were reported to her on two different days.  </p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[6]</span></span></span></a> At trial, the appellant denied that he put a knife against Ms. Pauls’
    throat.  He said he was cutting food with
    a knife when he and Ms. Pauls were “discussing stuff”.  The appellant insisted that he was not close
    to Ms. Pauls while he was holding the knife.   </p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[7]</span></span></span></a> There is one reference in the appellant’s factum suggesting that there was no
    evidence from which a finding of fabrication could be made.  I do not think, however, this was the
    argument put forward either in the factum or in oral argument.  If it was, I disagree with it for the reasons
    set out in this paragraph.</p>
