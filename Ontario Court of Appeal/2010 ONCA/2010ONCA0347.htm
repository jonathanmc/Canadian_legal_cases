style='line-height:200%'>the application of the <i>Hague
    Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</i>, 1980,
    C.T.S. 1983/35; 19 I.L.M. 1501 (the <i>Convention</i>).   The circumstances involve the appellant
    father, the respondent mother and their child, a 2 year old daughter.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At para. 36 of her reasons, this is how the application judge
    described this family’s situation at the time of the hearing: “The daughter was
    born in England, is a citizen of both England and Canada, has doctors in each
    country, is in the process of obtaining an OHIP card in Ontario and has her
    mother’s family resident here.&nbsp; Her father and his family are resident in
    England”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The mother together with the child left England for Canada in
    March 2009 for a vacation with her parents.  They were originally scheduled to return to England on April 12, 2009
    but the mother extended their stay in Toronto and changed their return date to
    June 5, 2009.  However, on June 5, the
    mother emailed the father to inform him that she would not be returning.&nbsp;
    The father sought an order from the application judge that the child was being
    wrongfully retained in Ontario by the mother.&nbsp; His position was that the
    child’s retention in Ontario constituted a “wrongful removal” or “retention” of
    her within the meaning of the <i>Convention</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge concluded that the child had been
    removed from England with the permission of the father, but that he had not
    consented to the child’s being retained beyond June 5, 2009.  However, she refused to grant the father’s
    application on two grounds.  First, that
    the child is habitually resident in Ontario, or that she was habitually
    resident in both Ontario and England, and therefore the <i>Convention</i> did not apply.&nbsp; In the alternative, she found that
    Article 13 (b) of the <i>Convention</i> did
    apply and that the mother and child were to remain in Ontario.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    comprehensive and thoughtful reasons, I find that in all the circumstances of
    this case, I must disagree with her conclusions.  In my view, there were no grounds on which to
    dismiss the father’s application.  In
    doing so, the application judge erred in both her interpretation and
    application of the <i>Convention</i>.&nbsp; </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The father and mother met in Toronto in April
    2006.  In the fall of 2006, they spent
    one month in Gibraltar and Spain before moving to England in November
    2006.  The mother had originally entered
    England on a tourist visa.&nbsp; She then obtained a “fiancée visa” in order to
    allow her to stay there, and she eventually obtained a “spousal visa”.  They were married on August 7, 2007 in London
    and their child was born there on November 3, 2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    home in Canada, ostensibly on vacation.  She was scheduled to return on April 12, 2009, but delayed this until
    June 5, 2009.  As I noted above, neither
    the mother nor the child returned to England; rather, on June 5, 2009, the
    mother filed an action in Toronto in the Superior Court for custody of their
    child.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On July 9, 2009, the father moved, <i>ex parte</i> before the
    Family Division of the High Court of Justice in London, England, for an order
    making his daughter a Ward of the Court during her minority.  The High Court of Justice in England granted
    the order and the daughter was made a ward of the Crown in England until
    further order of the court.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On July 27, 2009, a representative of the Official Solicitor,
    International Child Abduction &amp; Contact Unit, wrote to the Reciprocity
    Office of the Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario to put that Office on
    notice that the father was going to bring on a <i>Convention</i> application for the return of the child to England. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As part of the mother’s proceedings in Ontario, the father
    brought his<i> Convention</i> application,
    which was heard on September 14, 2009.&nbsp; The application judge dismissed
    the father’s application on two grounds.  First, she found that, pursuant to Article 3 of the<i> Convention</i>, the child was not habitually resident in England.  Second, she found that, pursuant to Article
    13(b), returning the child to England would place her in an intolerable
    situation.  It is that decision that is
    the subject of this appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I will refer to other background facts later in these reasons

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The father raises numerous issues on this appeal;
    however, they condense into two questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)       Did the application judge err in her
    interpretation of Article 3 of the<i> Convention</i>, namely, the habitual residence of the child? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)      Did
    the application judge err in her interpretation of Article 13(b) of the <i>Convention</i>?  That is, would a return of the child to
    England place the child in an intolerable situation?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have already noted, and as I will demonstrate, I
    find that the application judge erred in her answers to both questions.   Given this, I would allow the appeal and
    order that the child be returned to London, England.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Relevant Provisions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Convention</i> was incorporated into Ontario law pursuant to s. 46(2) of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.12.  The following provisions of the <i>Convention</i> are relevant to the
    present dispute:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 3 </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The removal or the
    retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any
    other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the
    child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either
    jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or
    retention.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 4</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Convention shall
    apply to any child who was habitually resident in a Contracting State
    immediately before any breach of custody or access rights.  The Convention shall cease to apply when the
    child attains the age of 16 years.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 12 </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a child has
    been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of
    the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative
    authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than
    one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the
    authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 13</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Notwithstanding the
    provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority
    of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the
    person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>... </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>there</span> is a
    grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or
    psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable
    situation.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Interpretation of the <i>Convention</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Thomson v. Thomson</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551,
    at para. 41, interpretation of the <i>Convention</i> should be grounded in the rules established by the <i>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</i>, Can. T.S. 1980 No. 37.,
    in particular, Article 31(1) which states: “A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
    ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in
    the light of its object and purpose.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would note that at para. 38 of her reasons, the
    application judge describes the “underlying purposes of the Convention” as “to
    protect children from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or
    retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the
    state of their habitual residence.”  Careful
    review of the application judge’s reasons reveals that her analysis focussed on
    what she determined to be in the best interests of the child and the mother
    given that they were in Canada at the time of the application.  In particular, she seems to have been of the
    view that there were no “harmful effects” from which the child required
    protection.  In my view, this led the
    application judge to err in considering factors not strictly relevant to the
    analysis as defined in the <i>Convention</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The objects of the <i>Convention</i> are listed in article 1.  They are to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or
    retained in any Contracting State, and to ensure respect for rights of access
    and custody.  Implicit in the language of
    the<i> Convention</i> is that each
    contracting state acknowledges that it is the courts of the country in which
    the child was habitually resident before his or her wrongful removal or
    retention that are, in principal, the best place to decide questions of custody
    and access.  Articles 1 and 2 of the <i>Convention</i> clearly reflect this.  It bears repeating what Feldman J.A. made
    clear at para. 7 in <i>Korutowska-Wooff v.
    Wooff</i> (2004), 242 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 385:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The court of the
    contracting state to which the child was removed is not to enter into a
    determination of the custodial rights of the parties, but is to return the
    child to the state from which he or she was removed, in order that the custody
    and related issues be determined in that state. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Convention</i> achieves this by creating a uniform code of rules to be applied by Contracting
    States.  The need for uniformity in the
    interpretation of the <i>Convention</i> among state parties was stressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Re H.</i> [1998] AC 72 at 87:  “An international Convention, expressed in
    different languages and intended to apply to a wide range of differing legal
    systems, cannot be construed differently in different jurisdictions.  The Convention must have the same meaning and
    effect under the laws of all contracting states.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By incorporating the <i>Convention</i> into Ontario law, the legislature not only adopted the
    rules it sets out, but endorsed the goal of the contracting states to have
    those rules interpreted and applied uniformly.  As stated by the Supreme Court in <i>Thomson</i> at para. 42, “[i]t would be odd if in construing an international treaty to
    which the legislature has attempted to give effect, the treaty were not
    interpreted in the manner in which the state [sic] parties to the treaty must
    have intended.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would note that in interpreting the <i>Convention</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada,
    has cited jurisprudence from several other states parties:  See <i>Thomson</i> at para. 82.  Canadian jurisprudence has
    in turn been cited by other Contracting States:  Paul R. Beaumont and Peter E. McEleavy, <i>The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction</i> (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1999) at 235-236;
    See <i>Nunez-Escudero v. Tice-Menley</i>, 58
    F. 3d 374 (1995), citing <i>Thomson</i>.  Although foreign case law is not binding, the
    court should nevertheless take care to ensure consistency with the
    interpretations adopted by the courts of other states parties, particularly
    where a consensus has emerged from among them.  To do otherwise would, in my view, not only weaken the <i>Convention</i> but also run contrary to the
    will of the legislature which has chosen to enact it into domestic law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As I noted briefly at the outset, the application judge
    rejected the father’s application on two grounds.  First, she found that the child was either
    habitually resident in Ontario or had two habitual residences – Ontario and England
    - and therefore the <i>Convention</i> did
    not apply to her.  In the alternative,
    she found that returning the child to England would place her in an
    “intolerable” situation.  In my view,
    these findings cannot be supported by the ordinary meaning of the terms of the <i>Convention</i> as interpreted by courts in
    Canada and in other contracting states.  I
    will address each of the application judge’s grounds in order.<u></u></span></p>

    comments.  First, it is clear from both
    the wording of the provisions and the jurisprudence that an applicant need not
    establish <i>permanent</i> residence.  Second, pursuant to Article 4, “[t]he
    Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a
    Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access
    rights.”  It is thus clear that in
    determining the child’s habitual residence, facts arising after they have been
    wrongfully removed are irrelevant to the analysis.  I would note that such facts will be relevant
    under Article 12, which applies where an application is not brought within one
    year of the wrongful removal, but that issue does not arise in the present
    case.</span></p>

    Canada:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In the case before me, I find on the facts
    that the mother never intended to reside permanently in England.  She saw herself staying there for a short
    time while the father worked there.  I

    Canada.”  She discounted the father’s
    habitual residence because it was liable to change.  Crucially, at para. 48, the application judge
    states:  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I find that the daughter is habitually

    of fact, I find that the application judge made three errors in principle in
    making these findings.  First, she set
    too high a threshold for habitual residence, appearing to require the father to
    prove that the mother intended to reside permanently in England.  Second, she completely discounted the
    father’s residence in determining that of the child.  Third, she explicitly relied on facts arising
    after the wrongful removal of the child from England and based her decision on
    the child’s current residence.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the first, although the mother
    lived in London from November 2006 to March 2009 - with two 4 month visits to
    Canada – the application judge found that the mother never intended to stay
    permanently in London and wished to move back to Canada when the appellant got
    a job in Toronto.  I would note that,
    even if this were true, applying the jurisprudential principles referred to
    earlier, the mother would still be “habitually resident” in London at the time
    she left in March 2009.  Regrettably, this
    misinterpretation also led the application judge to find that the father’s
    habitual residence could not be determined because she found that he would
    likely move if offered a job abroad.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, the application judge noted that the child’s
    residence should be determined with reference to that of both custodial
    parents.  However, she then erroneously
    determined the child’s habitual residence almost exclusively with reference to
    the mother’s habitual residence and appears to have ignored the father’s.  Her reasons for doing so are found at para.
    46 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The mother has <i>de facto</i> custody of the
    daughter here in Canada.&nbsp; The mother has been the daughter’s primary
    caregiver since birth.&nbsp; The child has spent far more daily time with her
    mother than her father since her birth.&nbsp; The mother is one of her
    custodial parents and her habitual residence is here in Canada.&nbsp; The
    father, however, while habitually resident in England at the moment, could work
    anywhere in the world where there <span class=GramE>are</span> IT/gaming positions.&nbsp;
    His residence will continue to change as his work-pattern changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, this ignored the fact that, at
    the time the mother left England, there was no question that both the mother
    and the father were both custodial parents.  The <i>Convention </i>does not make
    protection of custodial rights contingent on an applicant being the primary
    caregiver, nor does it give preference to the custody rights of the primary
    caregiver.  It was an error on the part
    of the application judge to weigh the comparative custodial rights and caregiver
    roles of each parent as she appears to have done.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Third, the application judge framed her decision as being where
    the child is habitually resident <i>now</i>.  At para. 48, she states: “On the facts before
    me in this case, I find that the daughter is habitually resident in Canada now,
    and the Hague Convention does not apply to send the daughter back to
    England.”   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In reaching this conclusion, the application judge relied on
    facts that took place after the mother retained the child in Canada in June
    2009.  As cited above, the application
    judge noted that “[t]he mother has <i>de
    facto </i>custody of the daughter here in Canada.”  It was also noted that the mother was in the
    process of getting an OHIP card for the child and that the child had been
    living in Canada for the past seven months.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the evidence clearly establishes that in June
    2009, the time at which her wrongful retention began, the child was habitually
    resident in England and had been visiting Canada since March 2009.  As I noted, aside from two 4 month vacations
    to visit her grandparents in Canada, she had resided in England from her birth
    in November 2007 until she was brought to Canada in March 2009.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There is also ample evidence that although the mother may not
    have been happy in England, she was in fact residing there.  For example, she had an apartment there where
    her mail and bills were delivered.  The
    fact that she wished to return to Canada at some point in the future does not
    detract from the fact that she moved to England and resided there with the
    appellant and their daughter.  </span></p>

    immediately before the mother retained her in Canada.  I find it unnecessary, given my just stated
    conclusions, to consider the application judge’s alternative holding that the
    child has two residences.</span></p>

    text in its context and in light of the treaty’s object and purpose.  As stated by Chamberland J.A. in <i>F. (R.) v. G. (M.)</i>, [2002] J.Q. No. 3568
    (Que. C.A.), at para. 30:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Hague Convention is a very efficient tool conceived by the
    international community to dissuade parents from illegally removing their
    children from one country to another.  However, it is also… a fragile tool and any interpretation short of a
    rigorous one of the few exceptions inserted in the Convention would rapidly
    compromise its efficacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court in <i>Jabbaz
    v. Mouammar</i> (2003), 226 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 494 agreed with those
    comments and went on to add further comment, which is of particular relevance
    to this appeal.  At para. 33, Rosenberg
    J.A., writing for this court observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Refusing
    to enforce the Convention because the child might have to move a short time
    later is not consistent with the rigorous interpretation required and is
    inconsistent with the stated objects of the Convention to secure the prompt
    return of children wrongfully removed or retained from the Contracting State
    and to ensure that custody rights are respected.  Such an interpretation is, in my view,
    inconsistent with the thrust of the cases in this province such as this court's
    decisions in <i>Pollastro</i> and <i>Finizio</i>.  Continuity in residence is desirable but some instability is not
    intolerable.</p>

    out in the <i>Convention</i> is thus a high
    one.  <span style='line-height:200%'>The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Thomson </i>held at para. 28 that the risk to the child must be one of
    substantial psychological harm to the child.  In <i>Finizio v. Scoppio-Finizio</i>,
    (1999) 46 O.R. (3d) 226 (C.A.), relying on <i>Thomson</i>,
    MacPherson J.A., writing for the court, found that the father had on one
    occasion struck the mother, but held that this was not a sufficient reason to
    refuse his application to have the children returned to Italy.  This conclusion was based in part on the
    assertion that it should be left to the police and courts of Italy to minimize
    any harmful effects of returning the children there:  <i>Finizio</i> at paras. 33-35, citing <i>C. v. C.,</i> [1987] 1 W.L.R. 654 (England and Wales C.A.).  </span></p>

    v. Pollastro</i>, 43 O.R. (3d) 485, this court found that a continued pattern
    of escalating emotional and physical abuse, combined with threats against the
    mother and her family were sufficient to create an intolerable situation for
    the child.  I would note that the court’s
    conclusions in that case were based on evidence from the mother’s doctor as
    well as transcripts of a taped phone message.</span></p>

    child to England would expose her to an intolerable situation.  In so doing, she first found that returning
    to England would create an intolerable situation for the mother.  Although the application judge reviewed
    evidence of threats by the father and one incident where he shook her stomach,
    her reasons base her Article 13(b) finding on the following findings of fact:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    unflattering names.  He seemingly liked
    none of the wife’s friends”,</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>With respect, I find that the application judge committed several
    errors in reaching this conclusion.  First, as a general point, the application judge appears to have set the
    standard of “intolerable situation” too low.  The evidence accepted by the trial judge describes the father as
    irresponsible and disrespectful toward the mother, her family, and friends but
    records only one incident of physical violence, in which the father shook the
    mother’s stomach.  Based on the
    jurisprudence reviewed above, this is, in my view, not sufficient to ground a
    finding that the child would be placed in an “intolerable situation.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, the application judge’s finding that the prospect of
    living in government subsidized housing would cause the child physical and
    psychological harm presents several problems.  There does not appear to be any evidence on the record as to what kind
    of accommodations would be available and what risks they would entail.  In addition, the application judge’s finding
    in this regard seems to me to be contrary to the high threshold established in <i>Thomson</i> required to demonstrate an
    intolerable situation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Furthermore, the application judge’s finding is contrary to
    this court’s decision in <i>Finizio</i> where, at para. 34, MacPherson J.A. held<i> </i>that
    it should be assumed that courts of the requesting country are able to deal
    with the issues arising from the divorce proceedings, including child and
    spousal support.  This would apply
    equally to the application judge’s reliance on the fact that the father was not
    paying child support while the mother was in Canada.  In my view, absent strong evidence, it was
    not open to the application judge to find that the courts in England would not
    have granted and enforced support payments sufficient to allow the mother to
    acquire adequate housing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The third error in respect of this issue is the application
    judge’s reliance on facts that do not cause any direct harm to the child.  For example, she noted at para. 55 that the
    father was disrespectful toward the mother and did not like any of her friends.  At para. 56, she considered why returning to
    England would be intolerable for the mother; not why it would put the child in
    an intolerable position:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even though the father has family in England, his
    sister has said in so many words that she does not like the mother.  The mother has few friends in England and no
    family to support her and the daughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge, I believe, appears to
    have placed significant reliance on her finding that the father had a drinking
    problem and was prone to inappropriate and violent outbursts, which for the
    most part is contradicted by his evidence.  This finding is not sufficient to meet the high threshold required.  Nor, in my view, is it sufficient if this
    fact is combined with the others relied upon by the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my opinion, the allegations of the mother are insufficient
    to find that the requirements of Article 13(b) of the<i> Convention</i> have been met.  The evidence falls short of demonstrating that the child would suffer
    substantial psychological harm if she were returned to England. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would conclude with this reminder.  It must be appreciated that the court would
    not be forcing the mother or child to return to live with the father.  Rather, an order that the child be returned
    to England simply recognizes that the mother was not entitled to take the child
    from England and that custody proceedings should be decided by English
    courts.  Aside from recognizing that the
    English courts are the appropriate forum to determine the merits of the custody
    case, a return order also recognizes and trusts that those courts are capable
    of taking the necessary steps to both protect and provide for the mother and
    the child in the present case.  This is
    what underlies Article 13(b) and why there is such a high threshold for parents
    wishing to justify removing their children from one contracting state to
    another.</span></p>
