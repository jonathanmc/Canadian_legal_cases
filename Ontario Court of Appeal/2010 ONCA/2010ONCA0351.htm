  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Honeywell Inc. (“Honeywell”) appeals from the decision
    of Gauthier J. dismissing its motion to enforce a forum selection clause in a
    Bailment Agreement (the “Agreement”) by staying the action of Expedition
    Helicopter Inc (“Expedition”).  The
    Agreement related to a helicopter engine that Honeywell provided to Expedition.  The Expedition helicopter in which the engine
    was installed crashed in northern Saskatchewan, resulting in the death of the
    pilot and a passenger, as well as the complete loss of the helicopter.  Expedition commenced an action in Ontario for
    damages arising out of the crash.  Honeywell
    brought a motion to stay the Ontario action because the Agreement provided that
    the courts of Arizona have exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings “arising
    out of or in connection with this Agreement.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal.  The motion judge did not state or apply the
    correct test for enforceability of a forum selection clause and reached the
    wrong result.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Expedition is incorporated in Ontario and has its head
    office in Cochrane, Ontario.  It operates
    a fleet of eleven helicopters for charter.  Honeywell is a Delaware corporation which operates globally.  The leased engine was manufactured in
    Williamsport, Pennsylvania and converted to the specific configurations
    required by Expedition at Honeywell’s facility in Greer, South Carolina.  The Greer facility is managed by a Honeywell
    division based in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship between the two companies is such that
    the replacement engine was shipped, installed and in use before the Agreement
    was signed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The forum selection clause in the Agreement provided as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt'>CHOICE OF LAW.</span></span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt'> THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, CONTROLLED AND
    INTERPRETED UNDER THE LAW OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA, EXCLUDING ITS CONFLICT OR
    CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS.</span><span lang=EN-US> The parties (i) agree that
    any state or federal court located in Phoenix, Arizona shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction to hear any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or in
    connection with this Agreement, and consent and submit to the exclusive
    jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii)
    hereby waive, and agree not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise,
    in any such suit, action or proceeding to the extent permitted by the
    applicable law, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
    inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is
    improper, or that this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
    may not be enforced in or by such courts.</span></p>
  <h2>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for enforceability of forum selection clauses</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge recognized that the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s decision in <i>Z.I. Pompey
    Industrie v. ECU-Line N.V</i>., [2003] 1 S.C.R. 450, is the governing authority
    regarding the enforcement of a forum selection clause.  <i>Pompey</i> confirmed the exercise of the court’s discretion not to enforce a forum
    selection clause is governed by the “strong cause” test first stated in the
    British case <i>The “Eleftheria”</i>, [1969]
    1 Lloyd’s Rep. 237 (Adm. Div.).  The test
    in <i>The “Eleftheria”</i> as quoted in <i>Pompey</i> at para. 19, is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where plaintiffs sue in England
    in breach of an agreement to refer disputes to a foreign Court, and the defendants
    apply for a stay, the English Court, assuming the claim to be otherwise within
    the jurisdiction, is not bound to grant a stay but has <span class=GramE>a
    discretion</span> whether to do so or not. (2) The discretion should be
    exercised by granting a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown. (3)
    The burden of proving such strong cause is on the plaintiffs. (4) In exercising
    its discretion the Court should take into account all the circumstances of the
    particular case. (5) In particular, but without prejudice to (4), the following
    matters, where they arise, may be properly regarded: (a) <span class=GramE>In</span> what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated, or more readily
    available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of
    trial as between the English and foreign Courts. (b) Whether the law of the
    foreign Court applies and, if so, whether it differs from English law in any
    material respects. (c) With what country either party is connected, and how
    closely. (d) Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign
    country, or are only seeking procedural advantages. (e) Whether the plaintiffs
    would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign Court because they would
    (i) be deprived of security for that claim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment
    obtained; (iii) be faced with a time-bar not applicable in England; or (iv) for
    political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This 1969 British test is best appreciated by what
    Bastarache J., writing for the Supreme Court, said about it in <i>Pompey</i> in 2003.  Bastarache J. provided clear guidance as to
    how it should be understood and applied in Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central thrust of the <i>Pompey</i> decision is that the law favours the enforcement of forum
    selection clauses.  In a brief overview
    of the law, Bastarache J. observed “[f]<span class=SpellE>orum</span> selection
    clauses are common components of international commercial transactions”, they
    have, “been applied for ages in the industry and by the courts”, they “are
    generally to be encouraged by the courts as they create certainty and security
    in transaction, derivatives of order and fairness, which are critical
    components of private international law”, and “[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]t
    is essential that courts give full weight to the desirability of holding
    contracting parties to their agreements.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache J. noted that there is a similarity between a
    number of the factors of the test in<i> The “Eleftheria”</i> and those considered when applying the <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> doctrine in ordinary cases without a forum selection
    clause.  He then went on to clearly
    reject the approach of considering the forum selection clause as but one factor
    of a conventional <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis.  He described that kind of
    analysis as the <span lang=EN-US>“unified
    approach to </span><i>forum non conveniens</i>”.  He explained that a “different test” and
    “separate approach” were required.  The “starting
    point”, he said, should be “that parties should be held to their bargain”.  Bastarache J. adopted the view of E. Peel in “Exclusive
    jurisdiction agreements: purity and pragmatism in the conflict of laws”, [1998]
    L.M.C.L.Q. 182, at pp. 189-90, that the unified approach would not:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…ensure
    that full weight is given to the jurisdiction clause since not only should the
    clause itself be taken into account, but also the effect which it has on the
    factors which are relevant to the determination of the natural forum. Factors
    which may otherwise be decisive may be less so if one takes into account that
    the parties agreed in advance to a hearing in a particular forum and must be
    deemed to have done so fully aware of the consequences which that might have
    on, for example, the transportation of witnesses and evidence, or compliance
    with foreign procedure etc.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, Bastarache J. rejected the <span lang=EN-US>“unified approach to </span><i>forum non conveniens</i>” in favour of a
    “separate approach” that “ensures that these considerations are properly taken
    into account and that the parties’ agreement is given effect in all but
    exceptional circumstances.”  He observed
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The “strong cause” test reflects
    the desirability that parties </span><span lang=EN-US>honour</span><span lang=EN-US> their contractual commitments and is
    consistent with the principles of order and fairness at the heart of private
    international law, as well as those of certainty and security of transaction at
    the heart of international commercial transactions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, even though the literal wording of the test in<i> The “<span class=SpellE>Eleftheria</span>”</i> may imply a conventional <i>forum non <span
class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i> analysis, <i>Pompey</i> makes clear that such an analysis is not to be used.  Rather, the forum selection clause pervades
    the analysis and must be given full weight in the consideration of other
    factors.  It is not enough for the
    plaintiff to establish a “strong” case that Ontario is the more convenient
    forum.  The plaintiff must show “strong
    cause” that the case is exceptional and the forum selection clause should not
    be enforced.  </p>
  <h2>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s approach</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge in this case conducted a <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis in which
    she regarded the forum selection clause as but one factor to be considered, and
    a subsidiary one at that.  She did not give full weight to the clause, and she did
    not consider the effect it had on the factors relevant to the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis.  For example, she considered the location of
    witnesses and the procedures of the Arizona courts without taking into account
    that Expedition, by agreeing to the clause, had accepted at the time it entered
    into the contract that it would have to transport its witnesses to Arizona and
    resolve any claim it might bring according to the law and procedures of Arizona. In <i>Pompey</i>, Bastarache J. was not satisfied that even litigation costs
    disproportionate to the amount of the claim was reason enough to refuse to
    enforce a forum selection clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The marginal weight the motion judge placed on the
    clause is most evident in that part of her reasons where she sets out the
    argument in favour of enforcing it.  There
    she discusses only factors relevant to <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> and does not even mention the clause.  She alludes to the public policy that parties
    honour their contractual commitments and the principles of order and fairness
    at the heart of private international law only in setting out Honeywell’s
    position and not in her analysis of the factors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s failure to use the proper overall approach
    in applying the test is sufficient reason to set aside her decision.  However, it may be of assistance to future
    cases to discuss the analysis she did conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge did not mention that the forum
    selection clause provided that <span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>“THIS
    AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, CONTROLLED AND INTERPRETED UNDER THE LAW OF THE
    STATE OF ARIZONA”</span>.  Quite to the
    contrary, it seems the motion judge may have assumed the case would be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction in which it proceeded.  She observed that the plaintiff’s claim in
    Arizona might be dismissed because under the law of Arizona the issue would
    arise as to whether it had been “timely filed”, and noted that in Ontario such an
    issue would not arise.  There was no
    basis for the motion judge’s apparent assumption that, if the case proceeded in
    Ontario, the law of Ontario would apply.  The motion judge should have considered that the clause provided that
    the law of Arizona would apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it happens, the fresh evidence shows there is no
    issue of “timely filing” under the law of Arizona.  Counsel for Expedition acknowledged that the
    expert evidence about Arizona law that Expedition filed before the motion judge
    was directed only to the applicable limitations period in Arizona.  In any event, as counsel for Expedition
    recognized during argument, a party should not be able to take advantage of its
    own failure to bring an action in the proper jurisdiction in a timely way to create
    prejudice that would justify excusal from the forum selection clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also failed to accord sufficient
    weight to Expedition’s commencement of an action in Arizona.  She observed that Expedition’s action in
    Arizona “was instituted to preserve the claim within the limitation period.”  Be that as it may, instituting an action in
    Arizona was an act of attornment.  Clearly, Expedition has conceded that the Arizona court has jurisdiction
    and that it is feasible that the claim proceed in Arizona.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Expedition’s institution of an action in Arizona raises
    the factor of the multiplicity of proceedings.  The motion judge discounted this factor because of Expedition’s
    undertaking to abandon the Arizona action if the Ontario action were allowed to
    proceed. The motion judge should have at least considered whether a judgment
    obtained in Ontario would be enforced by the court in Arizona if that court
    concluded that the action should have proceeded in Arizona.  Expedition filed no evidence on this issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred by attaching weight to Honeywell’s
    concession that Ontario was the appropriate and convenient forum for the trial
    of the wrongful death action of the passenger in the helicopter.  That action was not governed by the forum
    selection clause.  As explained above,
    whether Ontario is the convenient forum is not the proper question in a case
    with a forum selection clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her analysis, the motion judge should have
    contrasted the jurisdictions of Arizona and Ontario.  Instead, she considered the appropriateness
    and convenience of the claim proceeding in Arizona on the one hand and Canada
    on the other.  For example, the fact the
    helicopter crashed in Saskatchewan provides little support for trying the case
    in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge considered significant expert evidence
    indicating that Canadian witnesses were beyond the reach of the Arizona court’s
    subpoena power.  She could have made the equivalent
    observation about the reach of the Ontario court’s subpoena power in relation
    to American witnesses.  Given the
    cross-border methods of obtaining evidence from friendly jurisdictions, this
    factor was not deserving of weight one way or the other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the motion judge set out only a portion of the
    test in <i>The “Eleftheria”</i>.  She omitted the portion of the test that asks
    whether the plaintiff would be prejudiced by having to sue in a foreign
    country.  While some of her discussion
    touched on aspects of prejudice to the plaintiff, she did not consider the main
    concern — whether the plaintiff could expect a fair trial in the selected
    forum.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is no reason to depart from the presumption
    that Expedition should be held to the bargain that it made.  A departure is only justified in “exceptional
    circumstances”, as Bastarache J. stressed in <i>Pompey</i>.  There is nothing
    exceptional about this case.  As
    discussed above, the analysis of whether there is “strong cause” to decline to
    enforce a forum selection clause is not an analysis of the <i>forum conveniens</i> in the conventional sense.  In this case Expedition may have established
    that it will experience some inconvenience in the conventional sense in having
    to assert its claim in Arizona.  That
    inconvenience does not justify permitting it to <span class=SpellE>resile</span> from its agreement in this commercial contract to tolerate that inconvenience. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A forum selection clause in a commercial contract should
    be given effect.  The factors that may justify
    departure from that general principle are few.  The few factors that might be considered include the plaintiff was
    induced to agree to the clause by fraud or improper inducement or the contract
    is otherwise unenforceable, the court in the selected forum does not accept
    jurisdiction or otherwise is unable to deal with the claim, the claim or the
    circumstances that have arisen are outside of what was reasonably contemplated
    by the parties when they agreed to the clause, the plaintiff can no longer
    expect a fair trial in the selected forum due to subsequent events that could
    not have been reasonably anticipated, or enforcing the clause in the particular
    case would frustrate some clear public policy.  Apart from circumstances such as these, a
    forum selection clause in a commercial contract should be enforced. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these factors has been shown in this case.  There was no basis to refuse the stay of
    proceedings.  </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the
    motion judge, and enter a stay of proceedings.  The appellant’s costs of the appeal are fixed
    in the amount of $25,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and GST.  The appellant is entitled to its costs before
    the motion judge.  Those costs shall be
    in the amount that the motion judge awarded to the respondent. </p>
