    a breast reconstruction procedure during the same operation.  Complications arose following surgery and Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> developed a large open wound in her abdomen that
    persisted until it was repaired some two years later.</span></p>

    in recommending and performing the breast reconstructive surgery.  As well, she was found to have met the
    standard of care owed in respect of Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> post-operative
    care.  However, the trial judge found
    that Dr. Chow failed to adequately explain to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> the material risks attendant on the breast reconstruction surgery, including the
    risks associated with delayed wound healing.  In light of this finding, the trial judge concluded that Dr. Chow failed
    to obtain Ms. Revell’s informed consent before undertaking the surgery.  She further found that the reasonable person
    in Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> circumstances would not have
    undertaken the procedure had the risks been adequately disclosed.  </span></p>

    October of 2000.  She made an appointment
    with her family doctor of 20 years, Dr. Wayne <span class=SpellE>Albus</span>.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Albus</span> sent her
    for a mammogram.  The results of the
    mammogram were negative.  Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> asked her family doctor to refer her to Dr.
    Heartwell, a general surgeon.</span></p>

    weighed 210 pounds, and had smoked 10 to 20 cigarettes per day for 25 years.  She also had a <span class=SpellE>sternotomy</span> scar in her abdominal area that was approximately 34 centimetres in length.</span></p>

    arranged a full biopsy, the results of which were positive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On November 27, 2000, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Heartwell</span> told Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> that she had stage two infiltrative lobular
    cancer of the right breast.  In
    consultation with Dr. Heartwell, Ms. Revell decided to have a modified radical
    mastectomy of the right breast and a simple mastectomy of the left breast.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Heartwell and Ms. Revell discussed various options for
    reconstructive breast surgery.  Ms.
    Revell was interested in finding out more about breast reconstruction.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Heartwell</span> referred
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> to Dr. Chow to discuss reconstructive
    options.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  The appointment lasted for approximately one
    hour.  During it, Dr. Chow and Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> discussed breast reconstruction options.  Dr. Chow told Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> that breast implants were not a good option for her.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>From Dr. Chow, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> learned
    that a bilateral pedicle TRAM flap procedure involved the reconstruction of
    breasts from tissue taken from her abdominal area.  Because Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> <span class=SpellE>sternotomy</span> scar could affect the blood flow to the
    flaps, Dr. Chow recommended that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> have a Doppler
    ultrasound test.  This test would determine
    the adequacy of the arteries and blood vessels in the abdominal area to provide
    blood supply to the tissue that would be brought up to form the reconstructed
    breasts.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Chow gave Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> a pamphlet
    on the TRAM flap procedure, as well as the names of other patients who had had
    the procedure.  Subject to the results of
    the Doppler test, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> understood Dr. Chow to
    have told her that the TRAM flap procedure was a good option for her.  They discussed her smoking.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There is a dispute as to whether Dr. Chow discussed with Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> the option of doing nothing in respect of breast
    reconstruction.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> testified that Dr. Chow did not discuss this option with her.  Dr. Chow testified that it was her usual
    practice to discuss that option with her patients.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ms. Revell testified that Dr. Chow told her at the first
    appointment that if she had the TRAM flap procedure, she would have scars on
    both breasts and in the abdomen from hip to hip, there was a slight risk of
    infection, she could possibly develop a hematoma, her breasts might not be
    symmetrical and there was the potential, but unlikely, possibility that she
    could lose her navel.  Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> also testified that she could not remember whether
    Dr. Chow informed her of the risk of tissue loss.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>According to Ms. Revell, Dr. Chow did not mention wound
    healing to her.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On December 7, 2000, Ms. Revel had another appointment with
    Dr. Chow.  Dr. Chow told her that the
    Doppler test showed that there was sufficient blood flow to proceed with the
    TRAM flap procedure.  Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> then signed a consent form for the TRAM flap
    procedure to be performed at the same time as the mastectomies on December 14,
    2000.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>After her meeting with Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> on December 7, Dr. Chow dictated a lengthy consultation note dated December 10,
    2000, which indicated that she informed Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> of,
    among other things, the risk of delayed wound healing.  Dr. Chow testified that in a case of a
    patient like Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span>, who was a smoker, obese and
    had abdominal scarring, her practice was to tell the patient she was at a
    higher risk for surgical complications, including delayed wound healing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Chow said that on the pamphlet that she gave to Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span>, she had indicated the potential area of concern for
    wound healing and had drawn a diagram of a triangle with the apex at the
    umbilicus down to the abdominal incision.  Because that is the widest gap, it is the area of most concern for
    problems with delayed wound healing. Ms. Revell agreed she received the
    pamphlet but could not recall what it said.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The mastectomies and breast reconstruction surgery were
    performed as scheduled.  Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> experienced delayed wound healing of her abdominal
    incision as well as of the incision in her left breast.  The wound in the left breast healed.  The significant abdominal wound did not.  Dressing for the wound had to be changed
    daily due to drainage.     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There is some question as to the extent to which delayed
    wound healing caused a delay in Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> chemotherapy treatments.  While the
    parties disagree on the length of the delay, it is common ground that some
    delay in chemotherapy occurred as a result of delayed wound healing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Chow followed Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> care
    until December 2001.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In January of 2002, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> continued to have the open abdominal wound.  It measured 8 centimetres by 8 centimetres and the mesh that had been
    used to close the incision was still exposed.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> was referred to a surgeon in
    London, Ontario.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In January 2003, the wound was closed by reconstructive
    surgery.  Following that operation, the
    wound finally healed and this action was started.  The parties agreed on damages should Dr. Chow
    be found negligent.  Thus, the only issue
    at trial was liability.</span></p>

    an expert for Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span>.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> also
    called Dr. <span class=SpellE>Albus</span> and Ms. Joanne St. Pierre to give
    evidence.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Albus</span>,
    it will be recalled, was Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> long time

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant says that the trial judge erred in two ways in applying
    the law of informed consent.  First, the
    appellant says that the trial judge’s determination that Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> had not given informed consent for the TRAM flap
    procedure is based on her finding that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> did
    not understand the nature of the risk of delayed wound healing.  But, the appellant says, Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> never took the position that she did not understand
    the risks involved in the procedure.  Rather, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> position throughout was
    that Dr. Chow never told her that she was at risk for delayed wound
    healing.  The appellant submits that the
    trial judge rejected Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> evidence that the risk
    of delayed wound healing was not disclosed and, as a consequence, it was not
    open to the trial judge to find that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> was
    told of the risk but did not understand it.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, the appellant submits that even if there were a basis
    on which to make the factual finding that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> did not understand the risks associated with delayed wound healing, the test for
    informed consent is not based on the patient’s subjective understanding and it
    was an error to decide it on that basis.  The appellant says that in the circumstances of this case, it was
    sufficient that Dr. Chow disclosed the risks associated with the procedure.  A physician has no legal obligation to ensure
    that the patient understands the information he or she has been given, except
    in specific and narrow circumstances.  The appellant submits that those circumstances include where the patient
    does not speak the language, is resistant to discussing risks, has limited
    education or is in physical and emotional distress – that is, situations in
    which it should be evident to the physician that the patient may not understand
    the risk discussion.  The appellant says
    that there was nothing in Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> presentation
    or circumstances that required Dr. Chow to do more to ensure that Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> understood the information that she had been given.</span></p>

    discussion took place is not sufficient to determine whether adequate
    disclosure <span class=GramE>was made</span> nor does it preclude the trial judge
    from finding that inadequate disclosure had been made.  As we have seen, the adequacy of disclosure
    is dependent upon the gravity of the risk, the likelihood of the risk

    determine whether the communication was sufficient to meet the disclosure

    that Dr. Chow told Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> she was at a higher risk
    of surgical complications amounts to a finding that Dr. Chow satisfied the
    first element of disclosure – she explained the TRAM flap procedure and
    identified the material injuries (risks) to which the procedure gave rise,
    including the risk of delayed wound healing.  However, the other findings of the trial judge, set out above,
    demonstrate that Dr. Chow failed to satisfy the second and third elements in
    that she failed to adequately explain the likelihood that Ms. <span

    explain the possible consequences of delayed wound healing, should that risk occur.      </span></p>

    to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> that because she was a smoker, obese

    risk of delayed wound healing.  Further,
    Dr. Chow had to explain to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> the consequences
    of delayed wound healing, one of which was a possible delay in receiving the
    chemotherapy she needed because of the cancer.  By her own admission, Dr. Chow told Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> only that she was at a higher risk to suffer from surgical complications – she did
    not go on and explain the likelihood that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> might suffer those risks nor the consequences of delayed wound healing, if that

    understanding.  That is, the trial judge
    did not find that Dr. Chow made adequate disclosure and Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> simply did not understand what she had been told.  Rather, the trial judge meant that the
    content of Dr. Chow’s explanation to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> about
    the material risks was inadequate because she did not inform Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell</span> of the likelihood that she would suffer the injuries(risks)

    cancer and related issues with a more positive and optimistic outlook, it is
    difficult to think that if Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> knew that
    problems with wound healing would mean that the abdominal wound would remain
    open, creating a hole that was at least 8 cm by 8 cm, that the flesh would
    decay and that it would smell of decay, would require daily treatment without
    improvement until a further operation was required to repair it two years
    later, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> would not have had the immediate
    TRAM flap and neither would any reasonable patient in her position.<b><i></i></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The second error, the appellant submits, is that by focussing
    on the actual complication that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> suffered,
    the trial judge failed to adequately consider the benefits of the
    procedure.  The appellant argues that
    there is medical support for having the reconstructive surgery done quickly.  For example, patients may have less anxiety
    about their cancer when they have immediate reconstruction.  The medical literature supports that there
    are psychological benefits to patients having immediate reconstruction.  These benefits, it is contended, must be
    considered in the context of the trial judge’s finding that Dr. Chow met the
    standard of care in recommending the procedure.  Where a treatment or procedure is medically reasonable, the causation
    hurdle is difficult to overcome because a reasonable person would not usually
    decline the treatment.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I accept that it is an error to apply the modified objective test
    from the perspective of hindsight.  As
    the Supreme Court of Canada said in <i>Arndt
    v. Smith</i>, in the quotation set out above, the court must consider what the
    reasonable person, in the plaintiff’s situation, “would have done … if given
    all the information about the possible risks”.  The question is not what the patient would have done had she known the
    full extent of her eventual injury.     </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>While it is unfortunate that in deciding this issue, the
    trial judge adverted to the actual complications that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span> suffered, her reasons for decision must be read as a whole.  When that is done, I see no reason to
    interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the reasonable patient in Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> circumstances would have elected to not have the
    TRAM flap procedure performed immediately after the mastectomies.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge identified the governing legal principles.  It is apparent from her discussion of those
    principles and repeated references to <span class=SpellE><i>Reibl</i></span><i> v. Hughes </i>that
    she was aware that the modified objective test protects against the dangers of
    a purely subjective approach.  The trial
    judge also made the findings required by the modified objective test.  She considered Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell’s</span> circumstances, taking into account the special considerations that affected Ms. <span class=SpellE>Revell</span>.  She
    found that:</span></p>

    kind of a priority.  Ms. <span

    or especially concerned about the loss of her breasts.  She was not a person focused on her
    appearance nor was her self-esteem dependent on the immediate replacement of
    her breasts;</span></p>
