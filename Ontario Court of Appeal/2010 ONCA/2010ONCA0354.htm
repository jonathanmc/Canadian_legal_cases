  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal from the order of Power J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice dated October 20, 2009, upholding: (i) the decision
    of Master Beaudoin, dated January 2, 2009, concerning documentary production,
    the discovery of non-parties and related pleadings relief; and (ii) the
    master’s costs award dated March 5, 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appeal must be dismissed.  For the following reasons, we see no error by
    the appeal judge that justifies the intervention of this court.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Failure to Appeal Master’s Prior Order</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the two motions before Master Beaudoin relevant
    to this appeal was a motion by the respondents concerning an earlier order by
    Master Beaudoin dated June 21, 2007, which related, in part, to a production
    order made by Master Schreider in 1997.  The appellants maintain that the respondents’ attempt to revisit the
    June 21, 2007 order, in effect, was an impermissible motion to vary.  They submit that the issues raised on the
    motion should have formed the basis of an appeal from the June 21, 2007 order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument was advanced before the master.  He rejected it, holding: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[15]
       The Plaintiffs argue that the RCMP <span
class=GramE>are</span> prohibited from redacting information because my order
    of June 21, 2007 specifically ordered all documents produced “without
    redactions”.  In their view, the RCMP
    ought to have appealed the June 21, 2007 decision and they are now out of time.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[16]
       The Plaintiffs have taken a narrow view
    of my decision.  I contemplated that
    there might be witness and informer concerns that may require protection.  My order was made before all of the new
    documents had been collected and reviewed for privilege and I conclude that [it]
    was open to the Defendants to seek a variation of my order in the light of the
    fresh evidence they have filed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge also considered and rejected this
    argument.  He held that the respondents
    “were not pursuing a back door appeal” of the June 21, 2007 order.  Rather, they were seeking to have the master
    resolve “serious issues concerning difficulties regarding the documentation” to
    be produced by the respondents in light of the master’s ruling that protection
    of the privacy interests of witnesses and informants might be required with
    respect to the respondents’ productions.  In other words, the master’s June 21, 2007 order contemplated that some
    changes to the production otherwise ordered might be required to protect the interests
    of affected individuals.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents were not seeking to overturn the
    master’s June 21, 2007 order.  Instead,
    they sought to have that order implemented in accordance with any protective
    terms – including terms permitting redactions to certain of the respondents’
    documentary productions – that the master considered necessary and
    appropriate.  The potential inclusion of
    protective terms was expressly contemplated by the master’s reasons in support
    of his original order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, we agree with the respondents’
    submission that an appeal from the June 21, 2007 order was neither warranted
    nor necessary.  The master did not err by
    entertaining the respondents’ motion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Fresh
    Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely on fresh evidence in the form of an
    affidavit sworn by Paul Temelini to argue that informant privilege cannot be
    made out in this case since the individual alleged to be the police informant
    has denied any knowledge of the RCMP investigation of Mr. Temelini.  The appellants submit that, as a result, this
    individual, whose identity is known to them, cannot have been a police
    informant.  Accordingly, any redactions
    to the respondents’ productions made to protect his identity are not properly
    the subject of informant privilege.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, even assuming that the fresh evidence
    tendered by the appellants meets the test for admission on appeal, it does not
    assist the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record indicates that the RCMP, by its documentary
    redactions, sought to protect the identities of more than one informant.  We did not understand the appellants to
    dispute this claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, informant privilege applies to both the Crown
    and the informant: waiver of the privilege by one does not constitute waiver by
    the other: see <i>Named Person v. Vancouver
    Sun</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 252, at para. 25.  There is no evidence on this record that any of the informants protected
    under the master’s order have waived their right to privilege.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the fresh evidence is at best equivocal
    as to the relevant individual’s status as an informant.  In our view, contrary to the appellants’
    submission, the fresh evidence does not contain a clear admission that the
    individual in question was not a police informant.  Further, the applicable fresh evidence from
    this individual is not under oath.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We therefore reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Master’s
    Costs Award</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Nor do
    we see any basis on which to interfere with the master’s discretionary costs
    award, which fixed the costs of the two motions in the global amount of
    $40,000, “payable in the cause”.  The
    results on the two motions before the master were mixed.  Nothing in these reasons changes that outcome. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Other
    Grounds of Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellants raised various other grounds of
    appeal in their Notice of Appeal and factum, these additional grounds were not
    pursued in oral argument. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(5)       Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal is
    dismissed.  The respondents are entitled
    to their costs of the appeal, fixed in the amount of $10,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.</p>
