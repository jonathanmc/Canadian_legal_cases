  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Peter J. Grant Sr., is the Chief
    Executive Officer and controlling shareholder of Grant Forest Products Inc.
    (GFPI).  Pursuant to an agreement between
    the respondent and GFPI (the Tax Refund Agreement), the company was required to
    deliver a “transfer” document to Mr. Grant on January 2, 2009, which entitled
    him to the tax refund due to the company in 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In breach of the Tax Refund Agreement, GFPI failed to
    deliver this transfer.  On June 25, 2009,
    the company sought and received protection under the <i>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as
    amended.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Grant moved successfully for a declaration that, in
    equity, the transfer has taken place as of January 2, 2009 and, as a consequence,
    he acquired full right, title and interest in the 2009 tax refund as of that
    date.  The motion judge reached this
    conclusion by applying the principle that equity considers done what ought to
    be done.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question in this appeal is whether the motion judge
    was correct to apply the maxim or whether by doing so he effectively rewrote
    the contract between the parties.  For
    the reasons that follow, which closely parallel those of the motion judge, I
    conclude that he was correct and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GFPI is in the lumber business.  The respondent started the business in 1980,
    but by the mid-point of the present decade GFPI’s financial health had declined
    to the point that the respondent began to advance the company funds in several
    different ways.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of these ways was the Tax Refund Agreement.  It took effect on March 31, 2008, and
    provided that the respondent would pay US $20 million to GFPI in March 2008 to
    purchase $10 million US worth of income tax refunds due to GFPI in each of 2008
    and 2009.  The contract was carefully
    structured to comply with GFPI’s credit agreements, which set out that the
    total amount of assets sold in a given year could not exceed $10 million. Thus,
    while the company immediately acquired the US $20 million paid by the
    respondent, he acquired no right, title or interest in the 2009 tax refund
    until GFPI delivered the transfer to him at the 2009 Closing – defined in the
    Agreement as “the closing of the purchase and sale of the Sold 2009 Refund on January
    2, 2009.”  The relevant provisions of the
    Agreement are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 5.02  <u>No
    Interest of Purchaser in Sold 2009 Refund <span class=GramE>Until</span> 2009
    Closing</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties agree, notwithstanding any other
    provision of this Agreement or any other right or purported right of the
    Purchaser, that the Purchaser does not acquire any right, title or interest in
    the Sold 2009 Refund, and the Vendor does not sell, assign or transfer any
    right, title or interest in the Sold 2009 Refund until the Vendor delivers to
    the Purchaser at the 2009 Closing, the transfer referred to in Section 7.04(a)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 7.04  <u>Deliveries
    or Payments on 2009 Closing by the Vendor</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Vendor shall deliver or pay to the Purchase at
    the 2009 <span class=GramE>Closing</span>, in form and substance satisfactory
    to the Purchaser, acting reasonably:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       <span
class=GramE>a</span> transfer by the Vendor to the Purchaser of the Sold 2009
    Refund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Agreement also required GFPI to hold in trust for
    the respondent the 2009 tax refund that he purchased, once the company received
    it, after the 2009 Closing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 5.06  <u>Sold
    2009 Refund Held in Trust by Vendor</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Vendor shall hold in trust for Purchaser, keep
    segregated from any other funds, accounts or assets of the Vendor and pay to
    the Purchaser any amount of the Sold 2009 Refund received by the Vendor after
    the completion of the 2009 <span class=GramE>Closing</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 2, 2009, GFPI failed to deliver the transfer
    to the respondent as required by s. 7.04(a) of the Agreement.  It acknowledges that it is in breach of the
    Agreement for failing to do so.  It had
    still not done so by June 19, 2009, when the respondent, anticipating the
    company’s filing under the <i>CCAA</i>,
    demanded that GFPI deliver the required transfer document no later than June
    22, 2009.  Once again, the company did
    not do so, and on June 25, 2009 it sought and obtained protection under the <i>CCAA</i>.  The respondent’s motion ensued.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION APPEALED FROM</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent sought an order that he had purchased and
    was entitled to receive from GFPI the transfer, as defined in the Tax Refund
    Agreement.  GFPI took no position on the
    motion.  The appellant opposed the
    motion, arguing (as it does in this court) that the Tax Refund Agreement
    provides the respondent no interest in the 2009 tax refund before GFPI delivers
    the transfer at the Closing on January 2, 2009.  Since that transfer was not delivered, the appellant’s
    position was that the court would be rewriting the clear agreement of the
    parties by providing for it now.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the agent for a syndicate of banks who
    constitute the senior secured lenders to GFPI.  The motion judge found that these lenders and their solicitors were
    quite involved in the drafting of the Tax Refund Agreement.  He also found that it was the position of
    these lenders in 2009 that influenced GFPI to decline to deliver to the
    appellant on January 2, 2009 the transfer that the Agreement required.  In order for GFPI to have the support of
    these lenders in the restructuring that was required, they sought to have the
    US $10 million refund in 2009 retained in the company and not paid to the
    respondent.  In this court, the appellant
    does not challenge these findings of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, the motion judge found that it
    would be inequitable and contrary to the intent of the Tax Refund Agreement for
    GFPI to contend that, because of its own breach in failing to deliver the
    transfer to the respondent – that is, in causing the 2009 Closing not to take
    place – its requirement to hold the 2009 tax refund in trust for him does not
    arise. The motion judge held that the principle that equity considers done what
    ought to be done is applicable, and the transfer that was to occur on January
    2, 2009 must be treated as if it took place.  He concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, and I so find, as the transfer from
    GFPI to Mr. Grant is deemed at equity to have been delivered on January 2,
    2009, the trust provisions of s. 5.06 mean that if the tax refund due to Mr.
    Grant is received by GFPI, it is to be held in trust for him and the first and
    second lien lenders do not have any security over it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not agree with the assertion by TD that to now
    order GFPI to deliver a transfer of the 2009 tax refund would amount to a
    preference in favour of Mr. Grant.  It
    would not be providing Mr. Grant as an unsecured creditor with a payment from
    the company’s assets ahead of other creditors.  Rather it would be effecting delivery to him of an asset belong [<i>sic</i>] to him.  It is not the company’s asset.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellant argues that the equitable
    maxim relied on by the motion judge cannot be invoked to make for the parties a
    contract different from the one they made for themselves.  It also argues that it would be inequitable
    to apply the maxim following the <i>CCAA</i> order, because that would give the respondent recovery of 100 cents on the
    dollar on his unsecured claim, thereby creating a clear preference over the
    secured lenders whose recovery will be substantially less than that.  The monitor appointed for GFPI in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings supports the appellant
    and adds that the motion judge should not have applied the equitable maxim
    without considering whether this could potentially be found to grant a
    preference over other creditors pursuant to s. 95 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (<i>BIA)</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first question is whether it was open to the motion
    judge in the exercise of his equitable jurisdiction to apply to the equitable
    maxim that equity looks on that as done which ought to be done.  Like the other so-called maxims of equity,
    this is not a rule that must be rigorously applied in every case, but a
    principle illustrating the way in which the equitable jurisdiction of the court
    is exercised.  See: Hanbury and Martin, <i>Modern Equity</i> <i>16<sup>th</sup> ed.</i> at p. 27. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Snell’s Equity
    31<sup>st</sup> ed.</i> (2005), the maxim is described this way at p. 107:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This maxim has its most frequent application in the
    case of contracts.  Equity treats a
    contract to do a thing as if the thing were already done, though only in favour
    of persons entitled to enforce the contract specifically and not in favour of
    volunteers.  Agreements for value are
    thus often treated as if they had been performed at the time when they ought to
    have been performed, with the same consequences as if they had then been
    completely performed.  For example, a
    person who enters into possession of land under a specifically enforceable
    agreement for a lease is regarded in any court which has jurisdiction to enforce
    the agreement as being in the same position as between himself and the other
    party to the agreement as if the lease had actually been granted to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In addition, in <i>De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited v.
    British South Africa Company</i>, [1912] A.C. 52 (H.L.), this is said about the
    maxim at pp. 65-66:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Much reliance was placed by counsel for the company
    in argument on the application to the agreement of December 7, 1892, and
    especially to its first paragraph, of the well-known doctrine of Courts of
    Equity, that in equity everything should be taken to be done which ought to be
    done.  That doctrine cannot, in its
    application to contracts, however, be permitted to turn the conditional into
    the absolute, the optional into the obligatory, or to make for the parties
    contracts different from those they have made for themselves. What a party to a
    contract ought to do, within the true meaning of this doctrine, is what he has
    contracted to do, and nothing more and nothing less is to be taken, in equity,
    to be done.  So that the very first point
    to be considered in this case, necessarily, is the true construction of the
    contract of December 7, 1892 – the determination of what the parties to it had
    respectively bound <span class=GramE>themselves</span> to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the maxim can clearly be applied if: (i) the
    contract, properly interpreted, imposes an obligation on a contracting party to
    do something that it has not done; (ii) the contract is one that can be
    specifically enforced; and (iii) the maxim is invoked not by a stranger, but by
    a party who would be entitled to specifically enforce the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the time for performance required by the contract
    has passed, the application of the maxim allows the court to give recognition
    to the obligation from the time it ought to have been performed.  This can be compared to the remedy of specific
    performance which typically carries only prospective effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of this case make the application of
    this equitable maxim entirely appropriate.  The Tax Refund Agreement imposed a clear obligation on GFPI to deliver
    the transfer to the respondent on January 2, 2009.  GFPI failed to perform this obligation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the Tax Refund Agreement, delivery of the
    transfer created a beneficial interest in the 2009 tax refund in favour of the
    respondent, and a corresponding trust obligation on GFPI.  The obligation to deliver the transfer is
    thus the kind of obligation that the respondent is entitled to specifically
    enforce, and it is the respondent who seeks to invoke the maxim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the appellant’s submission, the application
    of the equitable maxim does not remake the parties’ contract for them by giving
    the respondent an interest in the 2009 tax refund even though the transfer was
    never delivered.  Rather, the maxim
    serves to cure GFPI’s breach of its obligation to deliver the transfer and it
    is the contract itself that then accords the respondent the interest in the
    2009 tax refund.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore dismiss the appellant’s argument that
    it is not open to the motion judge to invoke the equitable maxim in the
    circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I think it was inequitable for him to do
    so.  Quite the reverse.  As between the respondent and GFPI, it would
    be inequitable for GFPI to take advantage of its own breach of the Tax Refund
    Agreement by successfully contending that its failure to deliver the transfer (which
    precluded the 2009 Closing form taking place) excused it from its contractual
    obligation to hold the 2009 tax refund in trust for the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I do not agree that the application of the
    maxim gives the respondent full recovery of an unsecured claim against GFPI at
    the expense of the Company’s secured creditors.  The respondent’s claim against GFPI for its breach of the Tax Refund
    Agreement is not for money damages.  Rather,
    his claim is for a beneficial interest in the 2009 tax refund – one that the
    Tax Refund Agreement provides to him and that GFPI’s breach denied.  The application of the maxim simply remedies
    that breach.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if one went beyond the interests of the
    contracting parties and considered the interests of the secured creditors in
    determining whether it is equitable to apply the maxim to cure GFPI’s breach of
    the Tax Refund Agreement, in my view the answer would be the same.  As the trial judge found, the secured
    creditors were quite involved in the beginning in drafting the Tax Refund
    Agreement, and it was their position with GFPI that influenced the company to
    breach its contractual obligation to the respondent.  It is hardly inequitable for the court to
    apply the equitable maxim to require the secured creditors to live with an

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final issue to be considered is the monitor’s
    argument that the motion judge should have considered s. 95 of the <i>BIA</i> in determining whether to apply the
