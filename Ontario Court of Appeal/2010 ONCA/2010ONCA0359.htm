  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Domenic Rosso appeals from the order of
    Pierce R.S.J. dated November&nbsp;5, 2009, granting summary judgment in favour
    of the respondent Joseph Gouveia and dismissing Rosso’s fourth party claim
    against Gouveia.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rosso further appeals from the costs order dated
    January 15, 2010, in which costs were assessed against him on a substantial indemnity
    basis in the amount of $25,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of argument, we advised the parties that
    we were dismissing the appeal from the order granting summary judgment and that
    we were reserving our decision on the costs award. Our reasons on both of these
    matters follow.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Order Granting Summary Judgment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Our
    reasons for dismissing the appeal granting summary judgment in favour of
    Gouveia may be stated briefly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    fourth party claim against Gouveia has its origin in the dismissal of an action
    brought by the plaintiffs 1013952 Ontario Inc. and Cuc Thi Nguyen against their
    insurers in the wake of a fire loss. Following the dismissal of that action,
    the plaintiffs commenced an action against Julian Sakinofsky, their former
    solicitor, for allegedly missing court-imposed deadlines that resulted in the
    action being dismissed. Sakinofsky, in turn, commenced a third party action
    against Rosso, his law clerk, for contribution and indemnity. Upon being served
    with that claim, Rosso commenced a fourth party claim against Gouveia for
    contribution and indemnity. It is that claim which forms the subject of this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his fourth party claim against Gouveia, Rosso alleged that at all material
    times, pending the dismissal of the fire loss action, Gouveia actively
    participated in the fire loss file and assisted Sakinofsky, initially as an
    articling student and later as a first year associate in Sakinofsky’s firm.
    Rosso further alleged that in Gouveia’s capacity as an articling student and
    first year associate, he had an obligation to monitor the files of his
    principal Sakinofsky, and to ensure that Sakinofsky met the court-imposed
    deadlines under which the fire loss action was to proceed. Rosso alleged that
    Gouveia failed in this regard. He further alleged that at all material times
    pending the dismissal of the fire loss action, Sakinofsky was not attending to
    his practice because he was preoccupied with personal matters which were known
    to Gouveia. According to Rosso, Gouveia had an obligation, which he did not
    meet, of reporting Sakinofsky’s failure to attend to his practice to the Law
    Society. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    Gouveia’s motion for summary judgment seeking the dismissal of Rosso’s fourth
    party claim, the motion judge refused to admit three affidavits, which Rosso
    sought to file in the midst of the proceeding. She did so because the
    affidavits in question were served on Gouveia after he had been cross-examined
    on his affidavit and in any event, she considered the information contained in
    the three affidavits to be irrelevant. Rosso seeks to challenge that ruling on
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Assuming,
    without deciding, that the motion judge’s refusal to admit the contested
    affidavits constitutes a final order, we see no error in her analysis or
    conclusion and would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
    to the main point on appeal, the motion judge wrote extensive reasons for
    dismissing Rosso’s fourth party claim. She found, first, that Gouveia did not
    continue working in Sakinofsky’s firm beyond September 2001. This date was
    critical, she explained, because the order setting out a timetable for the
    progress of the fire loss action was set after that time. Thus, the motion
    judge concluded, Gouveia could have had no duty of care to the plaintiffs at
    the time the order was made or thereafter. The motion judge also treated as
    conjecture Rosso’s evidence concerning Gouveia’s involvement in the fire loss
    action. Whether she exceeded her role on the summary judgment motion in making
    those findings, we need not finally decide. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge went on to dismiss Rosso’s fourth party claim on the ground that
    the entire claim against Gouveia was misconceived. We agree. To the extent, if at
    all, that Gouveia may have been negligent in handling the fire loss claim, Sakinofsky
    was responsible for Gouveia and therefore, a fourth party claim was uncalled
    for; Rosso should have simply pleaded this as a defence to the third party
    action against him. In short, Rosso had no cause of action against Gouveia in
    the circumstances and the motion judge was correct in allowing Gouveia’s motion
    for summary judgment.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Costs Order</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge awarded costs against Rosso on a substantial indemnity basis. In
    doing so, she placed considerable emphasis on the fact that Rosso’s pleading
    and his affidavit contained “scandalous allegations about the behavior and
    personal life of … Sakinofsky which [were] irrelevant to the negligent claims
    against him.” In the same vein, she was critical of Rosso for maligning
    Gouveia’s reputation by suggesting that he was complicit in Sakinofsky’s
    negligence and/or improper conduct and that he failed in his obligation to
    report Sakinofsky to the Law Society.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge provided a second reason for ordering costs on a substantial
    indemnity basis.  She was critical of Mr.
    Isenberg, Rosso’s counsel, for failing “in his duty to the court to fairly and
    accurately state the evidence.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect, we disagree with both of those findings. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Commencing
    with the complaint against Mr. Isenberg, the record does not support a finding
    that he misstated the evidence. Having reviewed the entire record, it is our
    belief that the motion judge may have inadvertently misconstrued the import of
    Mr. Isenberg’s submissions. Be that as it may, Mr. Isenberg did not mislead the
    court and his submissions accurately reflect the evidence that was contained in
    Mr. Rosso’s affidavit and his cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for the scandalous allegations against Sakinofsky in Rosso’s pleading and
    affidavit, as well as against Gouveia by implication, while we accept that some
    of the language used was indelicate and could have been framed in more discreet
    terms, we are not persuaded that the attack on Sakinofsky’s conduct was
    necessarily irrelevant to the allegations of negligence against him. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    follows, in our view, that there was an insufficient basis for awarding costs
    on a substantial indemnity scale. That said, we should not be taken as back-tracking
    from our observation that the entire fourth party proceeding was ill-conceived
    and it should never have been brought. We find this troubling. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the end, we would grant leave on the costs appeal and reduce the costs to $17,000
