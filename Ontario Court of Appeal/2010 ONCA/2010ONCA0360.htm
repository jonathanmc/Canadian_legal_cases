  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the trial of two factual issues
    that the parties agreed to try separately, in the hope that the balance of the
    trial could then proceed more efficiently or might not be needed at all.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They asked the trial judge to decide the following
    questions:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the appellant Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou</span> recommended that the
    respondent Christos <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span> take the drug
    Coumadin; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou’s</span> note of September 18, 1998 accurately
    recorded the nature of the meeting he had with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span> on that date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After hearing the evidence, the trial judge decided
    both issues against the appellants.  She
    found that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou</span> did not recommend Coumadin to
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span>, and that his note was not an accurate
    record of the meeting of September 18, 1998.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenge both conclusions, arguing that
    they are tainted by palpable and overriding error.  They make two main arguments, and say as a
    consequence that both findings of fact must be set aside and a new trial of the
    issues ordered.  They also appeal the
    order awarding costs to the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ primary challenge is to the trial
    judge’s treatment of the expert forensic evidence called to address the
    September 18, 1998 note.  That note was
    glued onto a page in Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou’s</span> medical record for
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span>.  When it was glued was important in determining its accuracy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both sides called expert forensic evidence about
    whether the note itself had suffered water damage when the page on which it was
    glued suffered water damage.  The opinion
    of the appellants’ expert was that it had suffered water damage.  The respondents’ expert opined that it had
    not, and had therefore been placed in the file after the water damage
    occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the trial judge failed to
    resolve the conflict between the experts, and misunderstood the findings of the
    respondents’ expert that led him to his opinion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.  The trial judge clearly resolved the conflict.  She expressly preferred the opinion of the
    respondents’ expert to that of the appellants and, as the appellants
    acknowledge, she properly understood the opinion she accepted, namely that the
    note of the September 18 meeting must have been placed in the file after the
    water damage occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any basis to conclude that the trial judge
    misunderstood that expert’s findings that led him to his opinion.  The trial judge correctly referred to those
    various findings, including the general absence of water damage to the typed
    notation, the bleeding in the handwriting on the backing page and the fact that
    the bleeding and non-bleeding text did not line up with the placement of the
    current note.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The treatment of the expert forensic evidence does not
    reflect any error in fact finding, let alone one that is palpable and
    overriding.  This argument fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the appellants argue that the failure of the
    trial judge to deal with the evidence of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Rizik</span> and Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ziter</span> in reaching her conclusions constitutes
    palpable and overriding error.  The
    appellants say that their evidence is so important on both the factual questions
    before the trial judge that it just had to be addressed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, we disagree.  Dr. <span class=SpellE>Rizik</span> treated Mr. <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span> in November and December 1998.  His
    evidence and his medical records allow the conclusion that prior to that <span
class=GramE>date,</span> Mr. <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span> had been
    advised to take Coumadin.  It was not
    contested that the drug had been prescribed for him by an emergency room doctor
    in February 1998, and that he had taken it until a neighbour told him it was
    used in rat poison.  However, Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Rizik’s</span> evidence and his records say nothing about whether
    Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou</span> ever advised Mr. <span class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span> to take the drug.  His evidence is no more
    than equivocal on that issue.  There was
    thus no need for the trial judge to refer to it in answering the two questions
    before her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Ziter’s</span> evidence,
    particularly his medical record note of December 2, 1998, was that Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Spirou’s</span> office record indicated that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Stoiantsis</span> did not want to take Coumadin because someone
    had told him it was rat poison.  This too
    stops well short of clear evidence that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou</span> had recommended the drug to him or that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Spirou’s</span> medical records of the meeting of September 18, 1998 said as much.  Nor does it yield that inference.  The trial judge did not commit palpable and
    overriding error in answering the questions of fact before her, without
    referring to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants challenge the award of costs to
    the respondents, saying that costs should await the outcome of the full trial
    and should not be awarded issue by issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge was entirely within her
    discretion to award costs to the successful party for the trial of these two
    issues.  She was correct that the trial
    resulted in a final disposition of both issues.  Equally important as a justification for her order is that the procedure
    was undertaken by agreement of the parties.  In the normal course, the expectation would be that costs would follow
    the event.  It was open to either party
    to condition their consent on costs being deferred to the completion of the
    full trial.  No one did that.  In the circumstances, the costs award was a
    proper exercise of discretion, and we would not interfere with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondents fixed
    at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
