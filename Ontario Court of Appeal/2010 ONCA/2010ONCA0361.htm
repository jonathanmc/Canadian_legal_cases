    a crime.  A justice of the peace
    concluded that the allegations met the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> requirements and received the sworn information.  A Crown Attorney decided that it was not in
    the interests of justice to require those persons alleged to have committed the
    offences to appear in court to answer to the charges.  The Crown Attorney withdrew the charges
    before any inquiry into the issuance of process began.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal requires us to examine the scope of the

    helpful foundation for the discussion that follows is an overview of the
    statutory scheme for the initiation and conduct of private prosecutions of
    indictable offences under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  The relevant provisions have
    been included as Appendix “A” to these reasons.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The First Step:  Receipt of the Information</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    who has reasonable grounds to believe that another person has committed an
    indictable offence may lay <span class=GramE>an information</span> in writing
    and under oath before a justice of the peace under s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  By its use of the expansive term “any one”,
    s. 504 applies to everyone who lays an information (“informant”), including
    private citizens (“private informant”), peace and public officers, the Attorney
    General and the Attorney General’s agents (collectively “law enforcement
    informants”).</span></p>

    private informant who wants to lay <span class=GramE>an information</span> before a justice of the peace must complete a standard form for submission to
    the justice.  The private informant must
    provide sufficient details of the alleged offence to permit <span class=GramE>an
    information</span> to be drafted, and list the names, addresses and telephone
    numbers of the witnesses whose evidence will be relied upon to establish the
    truth of the informant’s allegations.  The private informant must also indicate whether the police have
    investigated the offence alleged and describe any prior attempts the informant
    has made to lay <span class=GramE>an information</span> or have process issued
    as a result.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    justice reviews the portion of the form that the private informant has
    completed to determine whether the allegations made satisfy the <i>Criminal Code</i> requirements and oblige
    the justice to receive the information.  Where the justice is satisfied that the <i>Criminal Code</i> requirements have been met, she or he will direct the
    preparation of <span class=GramE>an information</span> and have the private
    informant swear an oath or affirm the truth of its contents. Where the
    allegations of the private informant do not meet the demands of s. 504, the
    justice is not entitled to receive the information.</span></p>

    justice who receives an information laid by a private informant, and determines
    its compliance with s. 504, selects a date upon which a hearing will be
    conducted to determine whether the process of the court, either a summons or a
    warrant, will issue to compel the appearance of the persons named in the
    information to answer to the charge (“the pre-enquete”).  </span></p>

    order for process to be issued, s. 507.1, which governs the pre-enquete (<i>i.e.</i> the procedure to decide that
    question), requires that the Attorney General receive a copy of the private
    information and reasonable notice of the hearing: see ss. 507.1(3)(b) and (c).  Further, the Attorney General must have an
    opportunity to attend the hearing itself: see s. 507.1(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>d).  The <i>Criminal
    Code </i>does not provide a specific form of notice.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    function of the pre-enquete is to determine whether the process of the court, a
    summons or warrant, should issue to compel the persons named in the information
    to attend before a justice to answer to the offence charged in the private
    information.  At the pre-enquete, the presiding
    justice or provincial court judge must hear and consider the allegations of the
    private informant, as well as the evidence of the informant’s witnesses: see s.
    507.1(3)(a).  The justice must give the
    Attorney General an opportunity to attend the hearing, to cross-examine the
    informant’s witnesses, to call witnesses her or himself and to present any
    relevant evidence at the hearing: see s. 507.1(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>d).  The Attorney General’s appearance at the
    hearing does not mean that the Attorney General has intervened in the
    proceeding: see s. 507.1(4).</span></p>

    McHale sought <i>mandamus</i> from a judge
    of the Superior Court of Justice.  His
    application was successful.  The judge
    decided that the case should be returned to a justice of the peace, so that a
    pre-enquete could be conducted to determine whether process should issue to
    compel the appearance of the persons named in the informations withdrawn by
    Crown counsel.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Reasons of the Application Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    application judge held that s. 507.1 did not contemplate the authority of the
    Attorney General to withdraw <span class=GramE>an information</span> prior to
    the pre-enquete.  To countenance such an
    authority would render the procedure put in place by s. 507.1, for all intents
    and purposes, meaningless.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    application judge also rejected Crown counsel’s reliance on s. 11(d) of the <i>Crown Attorneys Act</i> to furnish authority
    for the right to withdraw <span class=GramE>a private</span> information at the
    outset of the pre-enquete.  Such a “broad
    and generous interpretation” of s. 11(d), the application judge noted, would engender
    a conflict between provincial and federal legislation, and improperly expand
    the provincial authority beyond the clear language in s.&nbsp;507.1.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Crown
    counsel contended that the discretionary nature of the extraordinary remedies,
    like <i>mandamus</i>, should result in
    refusal of the order sought.  After all,
    if process were to be issued at the conclusion of the pre-enquete, the Attorney
    General would stay the proceedings under s. 579 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The
    application judge rejected the submission as “entirely contrary to the
    reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Dowson</i>.”  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant advances two grounds of appeal.  The first is that the application judge erred in holding that the
    Attorney General had no discretion to <i>withdraw </i>the privately laid information at the pre-enquete prior to the issuance of
    process.  The second ground of appeal
    contests the correctness of the trial judge’s conclusion that the Attorney
    General had no discretion to <i>stay</i> the
    private information in the same circumstances.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US><b>Ground
    One:  The Crown’s Authority to Withdraw <span
class=GramE>a Private</span> Information</b></span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>Prior
  to the Issuance of Process</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    first ground of appeal requires an examination of the scope of the Crown’s
    common law authority to withdraw <span class=GramE>an information</span>.  What is different here than in the great run
    of cases in which informations are withdrawn by the Crown is that the
    information in this case is that of a private informant, not a law enforcement
    informant and the timing of the withdrawal occurred at the outset of the pre-<span
class=GramE>enquete.</span></span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Position of the Parties </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the appellant, Mr. Patton submits that the purpose of the pre-enquete is to
    determine whether process should issue to compel persons named in the private
    information to attend court to answer to the charge.  To ensure that only <i>bona fide </i>criminal proceedings are undertaken at the instance of a
    private informant, Parliament enacted s.&nbsp;507.1.  The provision recognizes the long-standing
    supervisory authority of the Crown to guard against frivolous and vexatious
    prosecutions going forward.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Patton invokes the well-established authority of the Attorney General, as the
    Chief Law Officer of the Crown, to supervise the initiation, management and
    determination of criminal proceedings, both indictable and summary, privately

    submits, is the right and duty to withdraw charges where the circumstances
    warrant. This authority originates in the common law, is carried forward by s.
    8(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and is not
    limited by failure of express reference to it in s. 507.1(3), a provision
    inserted to circumscribe the authority of a justice at the pre-enquete.</span></p>

    Mr. Patton continues, the <i>Crown Attorneys
    Act</i>, valid legislation in relation to the administration of justice in the
    province, provides agents of the Attorney General with the same authority as
    the common law, and imposes upon them the same duty to terminate prosecutions
    that have no reasonable prospect of success or are an abuse of process.  Far from creating a constitutional conflict
    or expanding the scope of s. 507.1, the provincial legislation complements s.
    507.1(3) and supports the authority advanced here.</span></p>

    the end, Mr. Patton submits that the application judge erred in cutting down
    the Crown’s plenary authority to withdraw charges at any time after <span

    process before the authority to withdraw becomes engaged is neither supported

    Attorney General to participate in the pre-enquete comes exclusively from s. 507.1.
    The section makes no mention of the authority of the Attorney General to
    withdraw <span class=GramE>an information</span> laid by a private informant.
    Not before the pre-enquete. Not during the pre-enquete.  Not at the conclusion of the pre-enquete when
    the justice orders process to issue.  Mr.
    McHale emphasizes that the pre-enquete is usually an <i>ex parte</i> and <i>in camera </i>proceeding,
    attended only by the informant, some witnesses and the justice. The
    intervention of the Attorney General is an exception, and so the need to constrain
    the Attorney General’s authority to what is expressly given. </span></p>

    Act, in particular ss.&nbsp;11(b) and 11(d), makes it clear that the authority
    conferred applies only to existing <i>prosecutions</i>,
    in other words, proceedings taken <i>after</i> process has issued.  In the event of any
    conflict between s. 507.1 and provincial legislation, Mr. McHale says, the

    who conducts the pre-enquete required under s. 507, and issues process to
    compel the attendance of persons named in the information to answer to the
    charge.  Since most prosecutions
    originate in this way, it is scarcely remarkable that most <span class=GramE>informations</span> withdrawn by agents of the Attorney General were laid by agents of the state,
    not private informants.  Yet no authority

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    s. 11(d) of the <i>Crown Attorneys Act</i>,
    on its face, confers no such authority and to combine it with s. 507.1 would
    expand from the latter beyond its clear and express terms in a constitutionally
    impermissible way;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iii.       that
    to permit exercise of the Attorney General’s authority to withdraw an
    information prior to the pre-enquete would render the pre-enquete, thus private
    prosecutions, of little or no value; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iv.        <span
class=GramE>that</span> the authority of the Attorney General to withdraw an
    information is limited to informations laid by law enforcement officials and

    agree with the application judge that the withdrawal of the information prior
    to the conclusion of the pre-enquete, indeed before it began, was
    premature.  But I reach my conclusion for
    substantially different reasons than did the application judge.  In my view, his reasons are at once

    preserved by s. 8(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    No <i>Criminal Code</i> provision alters,
    varies, modifies or affects this prerogative of the Crown.  In the absence of any general provision about

    enter a stay of proceedings at any time after any proceedings in relation to an
