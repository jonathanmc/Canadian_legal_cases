  </table>
  <p><b>By the Court:</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant background facts are fully and clearly
    summarized at paras. 1-17 of the application judge’s reasons.  We adopt and rely on that summary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=GramE>appellant, that acts as trustee
    for the Noteholders,</span> raises three issues.  Two issues arise out of the terms of the trust
    indentures under which the Notes were issued.  The third issue arises out of the application judge’s refusal to grant
    relief under the oppression provisions in the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, <span class=GramE>c</span>.
    C-44.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before examining those three issues, brief reference
    should be made to an unusual aspect of this case.  Some of the material placed before the
    application judge and this court is subject to an order made by Campbell J. on
    March 19, 2009, and continued in this court by Feldman J.A. on April 6, 2010,
    protecting the confidentiality of the material.  The application judge released two versions of his reasons dismissing
    the application.  The first referred only
    to matters that were not subject to the order of Campbell J.  The second version supplemented the first by
    addressing some of the material that was subject to the protective order issued
    by Campbell J.  The second version is
    subject to the protective order.  For the
    purposes of this appeal, it is only necessary to refer to the public version of
    the reasons.  The second version of the
    reasons adds nothing to the application judge’s legal reasoning, but does
    provide further factual support for his conclusions, particularly on the
    oppression remedy claim. </p>
  <h3>The Issues Arising Out of the Terms of the Trust Indentures</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues relating to the terms of the trust indentures
    are fundamentally matters of contractual interpretation.  We approach both on a correctness
    standard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arguments made in this court were fully addressed
    by the application judge, and we are in substantial agreement with his
    analysis.  The first argument arises out
    of the following definition of Project Change of Control in the First
    Supplemental Trust Indenture:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b><i>Project Change of Control</i></b> means the
    occurrence of any transaction as a result of which the Corporation ceases to
    beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least a majority interest in the
    Las Cristinas Project assets. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the trust indentures, the respondent
    (“Crystallex”) is required to purchase all outstanding Notes at 102 per cent of
    par upon a Project Change of Control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Counsel for the
    appellant submitted that the reference to “the Las Cristinas Project assets”
    must refer to Crystallex’s ability to acquire, explore, develop and exploit the
    mineral deposits that constitute the Las Cristinas Project.   He argued that Crystallex has effectively
    lost its ability to work on the project by virtue of the refusal of the
    relevant government authorities to issue the necessary environmental
    permits.  Counsel maintains that it is
    clear on the facts that the necessary permits will not be forthcoming.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found at paras. 24-29 that the unilateral
    actions of the government authorities - refusing the necessary environmental permits
    - did not constitute a “transaction” for the purposes of triggering the Project
    Change of Control provisions.  We need make
    no comment on that part of the analysis as we agree with his second reason for
    rejecting this argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge determined that Crystallex
    retained beneficial ownership of its contractual rights under the contract with
    Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (“CVG”), the Venezuelan entity that had
    granted the mining rights to Crystallex.  The application judge found at paras. 30-39 that the contract remained
    in full force and effect even though government authorities had to date refused
    to issue permits necessary to move forward with the project.  We agree with the application judge’s
    analysis.  Crystallex’s rights under its
    contract with CVG are the assets referred to in the Project Change of Control provisions.  Crystallex maintains beneficial ownership of
    those contractual rights.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second argument arising out of the
    terms of the trust indentures relates to the use that Crystallex could make of
    the proceeds of the Notes.  Under the
    relevant terms, Crystallex was obliged to &quot;[u]se the net proceeds of the …
    Notes to fund the development of the Las Cristinas Project, which funding may
    include the provision of cash collateral security for Branch Indebtedness.&quot;  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A breach of the provision governing the use of the proceeds
    of the Notes rendered the principal amounts of the Notes and any unpaid
    interest due and payable upon appropriate notice.  The appellant had given that notice to Crystallex.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant claimed that Crystallex breached the
    provision restricting the use of the proceeds of the Notes by selling equipment
    that had been purchased with the proceeds of the Notes and using the proceeds
    of that sale for matters other than the development of the Las Cristinas Project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2009, Crystallex sold equipment with a book
    value of $22.1 million for $11.3 million.  The proceeds of the sale of the equipment were dispersed according to
    the terms of an order made by Campbell J. on October 7, 2009.  $4.3 million was paid to Crystallex on its
    own account; $4.6875 million was held in trust for the appellant to be released
    either upon payment of the full amount owing or upon payment of the next
    interest instalment due.  The balance,
    about $2.3 million, was held by Crystallex in escrow.  Under the terms of the order of Campbell J.,
    the parties’ agreement as to the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of
    the equipment did not prejudice the appellant’s claim that the sale contravened
    the terms of the trust indentures and triggered the provisions rendering the
    entire amounts due and payable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trust indentures do not refer specifically to the
    use of the proceeds of any sale of equipment.  The appellant could have bargained for that term or taken security in
    the equipment.  In fact, the appellant
    did seek security during its negotiations with Crystallex but was unsuccessful.  Nothing in the trust indentures specifically restricts
    the sale of any of the equipment.  We agree
    with the application judge that it is not for the court to read into the
    documentation terms that would enhance the protection afforded to the appellant
    by the agreed to terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also agree with the application judge that, in any
    event, the use to which the proceeds of the sale of the equipment were put falls
    within the phrase “the development of the Las Cristinas Project”.  The Las Cristinas Project is defined as “the
    acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation of the mineral
    deposits”.  Development of that project
    goes far beyond steps taken to actually mine the deposits.  For example, money paid by Crystallex in
    efforts to maintain the CVG contract in good standing is properly viewed as
    part of its efforts to acquire the mineral deposits.  Like the application judge, we reject the
    very narrow definition of development drawn from certain tax cases and relied
    on by the appellant. </p>
  <h3>The Oppression Remedy Claim</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge’s careful analysis of the
    oppression claim at paras. 72-100 is entirely consistent with the approach
    outlined in <i>BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders</i>,
    [2008] 3 S.C.R. 560.  The application
    judge made three important factual findings:</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Noteholders had no reasonable expectation
    that the directors of Crystallex would follow any particular course of action should
    difficulties be encountered in obtaining the necessary permits from the
    Venezuelan authorities (paras. 84-85); </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Noteholders were very aware of the political
    climate and history of the property and hence, were fully aware of the risks associated
    with obtaining the permits necessary to allow Crystallex to operate the mine.  In the face of that knowledge, the Noteholders,
    sophisticated lenders, sought no protection in the trust indentures against
    those risks (paras. 86-88); and</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The decision made by the directors of Crystallex
    to carry on with attempts to bring the project to fruition rather than to
    abandon it and proceed with an arbitration claim was reasonable and made on an
    informed basis after taking professional advice (paras. 97-99).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All three findings are supported in the record.  We defer to those findings.  Taken cumulatively, they justify the
    application judge’s determination that the appellant had not made out a case
    for oppression.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, Mr. Bell, for the appellant, forcefully argued
    that the application judge had failed to consider that Crystallex was insolvent
    at the relevant time.  He submitted that
    while the directors’ duties were ultimately to the company, the directors were
    obligated to give primacy to the interests of the creditor stakeholders once
    the company crossed the line into insolvency.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leaving aside the value of any arbitration claim under
    an international treaty, at the time of the application, the liabilities of Crystallex
    exceeded its assets.  However, Crystallex
    had paid all the interest due on the Notes in a timely fashion.  It had paid other debts as they became due.  Crystallex was, however, rapidly running out
    of available cash - hence the sale of some of the equipment. Absent a fresh
    injection of funds, Crystallex would be in serious financial difficulty in the
    near future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It does not matter, for the purpose of determining whether the
    appellant was entitled to relief under the oppression provisions, whether
    Crystallex was technically insolvent at the relevant time.  What matters is the actual financial
    condition of Crystallex insofar as that condition is relevant to the assessment
    of the reasonable expectations of the various stakeholders and the reasonableness
    of the business decisions taken on behalf of Crystallex by its directors.  When determining whether the appellant was
    entitled to relief, it is the reality of Crystallex’s financial circumstances that
    matters, not whether the insolvency label can be said to aptly describe those
    circumstances.  The application judge
    properly considered the oppression claim in the context of Crystallex’s actual
    financial circumstances.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We reject the contention that insolvency necessarily compels
    the directors to favour the interests of the creditors to the exclusion of all
    other stakeholders.  As indicated in <i>BCE</i>, at para. 82:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There are
    no absolute rules.  In each case, the
    question is whether, in all the circumstances, the directors acted in the best
    interests of the corporation, having regard to all relevant considerations,
    including, but not confined to, the need to treat affected stakeholders in a
    fair <span class=GramE>manner ...</span> .</p>
 
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appeal is dismissed.  The parties agreed that the successful party on appeal should have its
    costs in the amount of $40,000.  Costs to
    Crystallex in that amount inclusive of GST and disbursements.</span></p>
