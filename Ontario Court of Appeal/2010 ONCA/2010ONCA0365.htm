  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a Crown appeal. The respondent was acquitted on
    one count of robbery and two counts of breach of probation. The Crown has
    raised several grounds of appeal which we propose to comment on briefly. In the
    end, for reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the errors, the trial judge impermissibly
    altered the substance of the reasons she delivered orally in court as
    transcribed by the court reporter. This was especially troublesome here as the
    editing occurred after the Crown had filed its Notice of Appeal. For obvious
    reasons, this is unacceptable and should not occur. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also conjured out of whole cloth the
    issue of the accused’s identity in the videotaped interview with D.C. Anderson.
    The issue of whether the accused was the person providing the statement to D.C.
    Anderson was not raised by the defence. Indeed, it was effectively admitted by
    defence counsel whose sole concern related to the second portion of the
    statement and whether it was voluntary. In conceding that the first part of the
    statement was not in issue and that voluntariness was an issue only in relation
    to the second part, defence counsel must be taken to have accepted that the
    accused was the person being interviewed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If there was any ambiguity on defence counsel’s motion,
    the Crown should have been permitted to call evidence to address the matter.
    This was not a case in which the Crown had neglected by oversight to prove an
    essential aspect of its case. Here, the Crown quite properly took it as a given
    that the defence was not challenging the accused’s identity as the person D.C.
    Anderson was interviewing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge erred in failing to compare
    the likeness of the accused in the interview with the likeness of the accused
    seated before her. She was apparently unaware of  <i>R. v.
    Nikolovski</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, and to the extent that it mattered, as it
    did in this case, she should have taken submissions from counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent concedes the foregoing errors but
    submits that we should sustain the acquittals on the basis that the respondent’s
    statement is ambiguous and that no trial judge acting reasonably could base a
    conviction on it. We disagree. In our view, a trial judge could find the
    respondent guilty of the May Street robbery on the basis of his statement
    together with the other evidence. It follows that the Crown has met its onus of
    showing to a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdicts would not
    necessarily have been the same had the errors not been made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the verdicts of
    acquittal are set aside, and a new trial is ordered on all counts.</p>
