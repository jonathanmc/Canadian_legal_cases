  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from her conviction for abduction
    of a child under the age of fourteen years in contravention of the provisions
    of a custody order.  For the following
    reasons the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue raised on this appeal is whether the
    trial judge erred in refusing to leave to the jury the necessity defence as
    codified in s. 285 of the<i> Criminal
    Code.  </i>The trial judge held that
    there was no air of reality to the defence because there was no evidence to
    support two of the three elements of the defence: no other reasonable legal
    alternatives and proportionality.  We
    agree with the trial judge that there was no air of reality to the
    defence.  We only find it necessary to
    address the issue of other reasonable legal alternatives.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The chronology of events is important to understand our
    decision.  In 1997, the appellant and C.M.,
    who were in a common law relationship, had a child, G.  In 2000, the relationship ended and C.M.
    moved out.  The appellant remained the
    custodial parent.  Her mother, the
    co-accused, lived with the appellant and G.  As a result of a June 2001 court order, C.M. was to be consulted on all
    major parenting decisions.  The Order
    also included a provision that the appellant not move G.s’ residence from a 50
    km. radius of Toronto without the prior written consent of C.M., and if the
    appellant intended to move on a permanent basis she was to provide 90 days
    written notice.  There were a number of
    disputes over access in the next year.  On occasion the appellant would refuse to hand the child over to C.M. and
    made allegations of physical abuse, such as complaining to the CAS that C.M. was
    spanking the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2001, G. broke his collarbone while with C.M.  The child’s physician referred the matter to
    the SCAN clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children.  The CAS also investigated.  Both agencies were satisfied that the injury
    was the result of an accident.  The
    appellant and her mother also reported to various professionals a number of
    incidents of what they viewed as inappropriate sexualized conduct exhibited by
    the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September 2002, the appellant informed C.M.  that she intended to move, with G., to
    Vancouver.  She had not provided the
    requisite written notice.  C.M.  obtained an emergency <i>ex parte</i> order dated October 2, 2002 preventing the removal of G.
    until October 16, when the judge assigned to the family court proceedings
    involving G. could hear the motion.  After being served with this Order, the appellant left a voice mail
    message in which, for the first time, she accused C.M.  of sexually abusing G.  As a result of the allegation, C.M.  included reference to this allegation in his
    materials to support the application to be heard October 16, 2002.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 10, the grandmother took G. to a walk-in
    clinic because his buttocks were red.  The physician referred the matter to the SCAN clinic.  Three days later, the grandmother took the
    child to the appellant’s cousin in St. Catharines and made complaints to her about
    suspected abuse.  The cousin then made a
    complaint to the local police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 16, 2002, the family court judge ordered
    that the appellant not remove G. from the jurisdiction until further
    order.  The father’s counsel brought the
    sexual abuse allegation to the court’s attention.  The father’s access to the child
    continued.  Over the next many months,
    the case was repeatedly before the family court.  In November 2002, the court ordered, on
    consent, that an assessment be done.  This assessment lasted for several months and included meetings and
    contacts with the parents, with G., with C.M.’s new partner, the appellant’s
    mother, the school, SCAN and the CAS.  The appellant made it clear to the assessor that she did not think she
    had to consult with C.M., notwithstanding the terms of any court orders.  The final report from the assessor
    recommended joint custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proceedings in the Family Court continued, but
    little progress was made because the appellant had discharged her counsel and
    her materials were not in order.  The
    next significant court appearance was to be on January 7, 2004.  This was an important date since the
    appellant had been told that she had to show up with a lawyer and the matter
    would not be further delayed.  In the
    meantime the appellant and her mother had begun to set aside money and make
    other preparations for abducting her son.  The uncontradicted evidence demonstrates that by this time the appellant
    had abandoned the court process.  The
    plan was to take G. out of Canada during the Christmas holidays because she
    would have him for a week without access by C.M.  This would give her an opportunity to get far
    away before anyone noticed they were gone. During Christmas 2003, the appellant
    took G. and drove to Texas, where they lived in hiding until a private
    investigator retained by C.M. tracked them down.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The elements of the necessity defence are not in
    doubt.  In particular, there must be some
    evidence upon which a jury could infer that from the appellant’s perception,
    but using the modified objective standard,  there was no reasonable legal alternative to taking the child in breach
    of the custody order.  The trial judge
    need only find that there is a real issue to be decided by the jury on that and
    the other elements of the defence.  The
    judge is not to decide whether or not the defence is likely to succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge held that there were at
    least three other reasonable legal alternatives, including that the appellant
    could have hired a lawyer to better handle her suspicions about sexual abuse in
    the family court proceedings.  We agree
    with that proposition, although we would frame it slightly differently.  Simply put, the appellant could have retained
    counsel to assist her in fully participating in the family court proceedings,
    placed the allegations of sexual and physical abuse before that court and
    sought an order that would have protected her child.  She did not do so.  Rather, as we have said, many months before
    the critical January 2004 date, the respondent had decided to abandon those
    proceedings and to abduct the child.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s case is not unlike this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. C.A.V.</i> (2003), 177
    C.C.C. (3d) 332.  There, Feldman J.A.
    speaking for the court, said this about other reasonable legal alternatives at
    para. 24:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The respondent had been given a window of time in
    which to demonstrate that her access to the children should be continued. One
    of her legal avenues was to build the record for access during that period
    based on her own actions, and possibly to obtain further expert assistance. <i>Another was to retain experienced counsel to
    assist her with the court proceedings, instead of continuing to represent
    herself and deprive herself of the benefit of professional representation in
    such a crucial matter. As noted above, she also always had the right to appeal
    any order, and if unsuccessful, to reopen the issue at a later date. In other
    words, the respondent had unfettered access to the courts for the purpose of
    seeking to resolve her concerns in a legal fashion. Furthermore, she had been
    given time to do so in the family law proceeding.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in <i>C.A.V.</i>,
    there was no air of reality to the necessity defence.  The trial judge was correct to withdraw that
    defence from the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
