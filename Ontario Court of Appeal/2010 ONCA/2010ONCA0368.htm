  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal from a decision of
    Lemon J. of the Superior Court of Justice sitting as a summary conviction
    appeal court. The respondent was notified of the hearing of this appeal but did
    not appear in person or by counsel.  We
    would not grant leave to appeal in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was convicted of operating a motor
    vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80 milligrams of
    alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  The
    trial judge relied upon the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, having concluded that the
    first breath test had been administered within two hours of the respondent’s
    operation of his motor vehicle.  The
    trial judge then continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In any event, if the court is in error in its reasoning
    or conclusion in this regard, even if outside the limit, the court accepts the
    evidence of the toxicologist and the expert <span class=GramE>report, that</span> the four factors or assumptions amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
    the essential elements of the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court judge concluded
    that it was open to the trial judge to rely on the presumption of identity in
    the circumstances of this case and rejected the ground of appeal relating to the
    trial judge’s reliance on the presumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court judge then
    considered whether the trial judge had erred in his acceptance of the report
    and evidence of a qualified toxicologist concerning the respondent’s blood
    alcohol level at the time he was operating his motor vehicle.  The summary conviction appeal court judge
    found error in the failure of the trial judge to require the prosecutor to
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt four assumptions relied upon by the
    toxicologist in reaching his conclusion. It was on this ground that the summary
    conviction appeal court judge quashed the respondent’s conviction and ordered a
    new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ground upon which leave to appeal is sought is the
    determination of the summary conviction appeal court judge to consider any
    issues relating to the report and evidence of the toxicologist, once having
    decided that the trial judge’s reliance on the presumption of identity as the
    basis for the conviction was free of error.  Absent an error in connection with the presumption of identity, the
    applicant contends the respondent’s appeal to the summary conviction appeal
    court should have been dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. R. (R.) </i>(2008),
    234 C.C.C. (3d) 463, this Court made it clear that leave to appeal from
    decisions of the summary conviction appeal court should be granted
    sparingly.  Although no single test can
    be formulated to identify all cases in which leave to appeal should be granted,
    two factors serve as guides to the exercise of our discretion to grant leave:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          the significance of the proposed
    question of law, beyond the specific case, to the general administration of
    justice; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         <span class=GramE>the</span> merits of
    the proposed ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The narrow issue raised by the applicant does not have
    significance to the administration of justice beyond the circumstances of this
    case.  On the contrary, the issue only
    emerges here because of the manner in which the trial judge determined the
    blood alcohol concentration of the respondent in the circumstances of this case:
    first, by invoking the presumption of identity and then, only if in error, by
    relying upon the report and evidence of a qualified toxicologist.  The decision of the summary conviction appeal
    court judge to proceed to consider the alternative ground, once having
    determined that the primary finding of the trial judge was free of error, does
    not involve an issue of importance to the general administration of
    justice.  It is not suggested that the
    manner in which the summary conviction appeal court judge approached his task
    is a recurrent problem in summary conviction appeal proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The narrow ground of appeal raised has merit: there is
    good reason to believe that once having decided that the trial judge was
    correct in relying on the presumption of identity, the summary conviction
    appeal court should have affirmed the respondent’s conviction, without going on
    to consider the admissibility of the toxicologist’s report and evidence.  That said, however, it is not every error of
    law that results in an order for a new trial that warrants granting leave to
    appeal. We note that the applicant confined her submissions to this narrow
    ground, leaving for another day the correctness of the summary conviction
    appeal court judge’s decision about the admissibility of the toxicologist’s
    report and evidence and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
    the assumptions on which both were based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave to appeal is refused.  Needless to say, it will be open to the
    parties to re-litigate the applicability of the presumption of identity and the
    admissibility of the toxicologist’s report and evidence at the new trial
    ordered by the summary conviction appeal court.</p>
