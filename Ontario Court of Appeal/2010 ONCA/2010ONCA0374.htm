style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was convicted of one count of robbery.  The robbery involved a home invasion, theft
    of money and drugs, and the use of a firearm, none of which were disputed at
    trial.  The sole issue was whether the
    appellant’s participation in the robbery was criminally culpable.  The appellant has served his sentence and is
    now appealing only his conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>His main ground of appeal is that he did not
    receive effective assistance from his trial counsel.  The fresh evidence tendered in support of
    this ground of appeal is not contested, only its impact.  We will address this ground last.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s second ground of appeal is that
    the trial judge erred in his assessment of three Crown witnesses.  We reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was clearly aware that the
    witnesses - who were all involved in the home invasion - were of unsavoury
    character and he noted their criminal records.  He assessed their evidence with due regard for these matters, as well as
    their role in the offences and their motives against the appellant for abandoning
    them at the scene.  We see no error in
    his analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to the ineffective assistance of trial
    counsel, we again see no merit to this ground of appeal.  The test that the appellant must meet is to
    demonstrate first, that trial counsel’s acts or omissions constituted
    incompetence, and second, that a miscarriage of justice resulted.  Appellate courts will generally first decide
    whether a miscarriage of justice occurred because unless it has, there is no
    need to pass judgment on the competence of trial counsel.  In this regard, the appellant has not met his
    burden in respect of either.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even if the fresh evidence had been tendered at
    trial, it would not have altered the verdict or give rise to a miscarriage of
    justice.  In the end, the trial judge
    found the appellant’s evidence to be incredible for many reasons.  In the context of the whole of this case, the
    fresh evidence - that he was at a doctor’s office earlier in the day - would
    not have transformed the appellant’s incredible story into a believable one.  Nor would it have raised a reasonable doubt
    about the strength of the evidence against him, especially since he could have
    been at the doctor’s office and still attended the early afternoon meeting at
    the lead conspirator’s home.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the evidence - including this evidence - is
    assessed in its entirety, the conclusion still remains that the appellant knew
    that he was participating in the robbery that evening and fulfilled his role in
    it.  Whether there was other evidence
    corroborating his testimony that he was at his doctor’s office around the time
    he is said to have attended a planning meeting - some 13 hours before the
    offence was committed - would not have changed the ultimate result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the fresh evidence leaves us far from
    persuaded that the appellant’s trial counsel was incompetent.  In so concluding, we find counsel’s evidence
    far more persuasive than the evidence given by the appellant.  We see no basis for disbelieving her account
    of the events that occurred once the appellant told her of his visit to the
    doctor’s office on the day of the robbery.  In particular, we accept counsel’s evidence that the appellant refused
    her offer to subpoena the doctor and adjourn the case and that he instructed
    her instead to carry on.  In the face of
    those instructions and given the tangential worth of the doctor’s evidence,
    counsel cannot be faulted for choosing to carry on.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
