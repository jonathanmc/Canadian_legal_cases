  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would dismiss the application to reopen the appeals for
    several reasons, the primary one being that we are not persuaded that the interests
    of justice warrant such relief. Beyond that, we are of the view that the
    proposed appeals have little potential merit. We see no basis for concluding
    that the trial judge did not understand the meaning of the word “appreciate” in
    s. 16 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. In
    finding that the applicant did not appreciate the nature and quality of his
    acts, the trial judge relied on the opinion of two psychiatrists over that of a
    third psychiatrist who felt that the applicant did appreciate the nature and
    quality of his acts. It was clearly open to the trial judge to accept the
    opinions of the two psychiatrists who supported the applicant’s position at
    trial and the applicant has not presented any evidence or arguments which would
    cause us to doubt the integrity of the trial judge’s findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the applicant was fully informed of the
    implications of abandoning his appeals by Mr. Davies who appeared before this
    court as <i>amicus</i> and who provided
    advice and assistance to the applicant. Nothing in the record leaves us
    concerned that the applicant did not understand the ramifications of his
    decision. The fact that he has now had a change of heart is consistent with his
    history of ambivalence and his otherwise impulsive behaviour that prevents him
    from making firm decisions and sticking to them. (See the disposition of the
    Ontario Review Board dated March 3, 2010 at pp. 6 and 7.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, if we were to grant the applicant the relief
    he seeks, we are concerned that he would at some future time decide again to
    abandon his appeals and we would be back to square one. That this is a real
    possibility is more than mere speculation. If the applicant were to succeed on
    the proposed appeals, he knows that the Crown will be seeking to have him
    declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate period of
    incarceration. While the prospect of such a daunting disposition might not
    present a problem for the applicant today, it could easily do so tomorrow. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, this is not a case in which the interests
    of justice warrant the relief sought. Accordingly, the application to reopen
    the appeals which were dismissed as abandoned by this court on April 3, 2009,
    is dismissed.</p>
