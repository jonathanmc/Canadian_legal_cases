  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found guilty of robbery and sentenced
    to eight and a half years imprisonment, less credit for time spent in pre-trial
    custody. He appeals from both conviction and sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons for conviction disclose no
    error. She applied the correct principles of law in determining that Ms.  Nowak’s lay opinion evidence was admissible.
    We see no error in this regard, either in her analysis or conclusion.  On this point, we note that the trial judge
    acted with care and refused to admit the proposed evidence of Detective Fairey
    as lay opinion evidence because of its weaknesses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are also satisfied that it was open to the trial
    judge to use her own observations of the accused and the photographs from the
    bank in concluding that the accused before her was the person depicted in the
    photographs. The trial judge instructed herself in accordance with the
    principles in <i>R. v. Nikolovski</i>,
    [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, and in our view, she made no error in concluding that the
    photographs from the bank were of sufficient clarity and strength that they
    could be used to identify the accused as the person depicted in them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the submission of the appellant, the trial
    judge was not required to go into detail or specify the particular features of
    the accused that enabled her to make the comparison for identification
    purposes. Here, the trial judge noted that “the robber’s general physique, his
    ears, neck, nose, goatee and general facial shape are all clearly visible in
    the photographs” and based on the observations of the appellant throughout the
    trial, she was satisfied that “the features of the robber shown in the 17
    photographs are strikingly similar to those of [the accused].”  Nothing more was required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge was aware of the failure of
    the investigating officer to follow every element of the “<span class=SpellE>Sophonow</span>”
    line-up protocol. She was nonetheless satisfied that the deficiencies did not
    prevent her from relying on Mr. Galati’s identification evidence. We see no
    error in the trial judge’s approach. The pictures in the photo line-up were in
    our view, sufficiently representative. They were shown sequentially to
    Mr.&nbsp;Galati. He was told that the suspect’s picture might or might not be
    included, and according to his evidence, which the trial judge accepted, he was
    not prompted or influenced in any way by the investigating officer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the evidence of Ms. Sleczkowski, the other bank
    employee, the trial judge quite properly accorded little weight to her
    identification evidence. Given the very brief time that Ms. Sleczkowski had to
    observe the appellant, her mistaken belief that he had dark eyes as opposed to
    blue eyes (the true colour of the appellant’s eyes), is of no moment and
    certainly insufficient to exclude the appellant as the robber. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the appellant has failed to satisfy us that the
    trial judge made any legal or factual errors in her analysis. On the contrary,
    the trial judge instructed herself correctly on the applicable legal principles
    and considered the whole of the evidence in arriving at her conclusion that the
    Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. We see no basis for
    interfering with that conclusion and the appeal from conviction is accordingly
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for sentence, the trial judge did not sentence the
    appellant on the basis that he was in fact armed during the robbery, despite
    making several slips in her reasons to this effect. This was made clear at the
    conclusion of her reasons in an exchange with Crown and defence counsel. The
    sentence imposed by the trial judge (eight and a half years less credit on a
    two for one basis for the 392 days the appellant had spent in pre-trial
    custody) was in our view measured. We see no basis for interfering with it.  Indeed, it comes within the range of sentence
    suggested by the appellant’s trial counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from sentence is also
    dismissed.</p>
