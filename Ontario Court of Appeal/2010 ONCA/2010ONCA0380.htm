  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> Health
    Care Limited (Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span>) has sued the respondents,
    three of its former directors and its secured lender, for breaching their duties
    to the company.  The respondents moved
    successfully for an order requiring Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> to make
    advances from time to time of the legal expenses they have incurred in
    defending the action, even though the action has not yet been concluded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellant’s position is that the
    motion judge erred in finding that (i) Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> By-law No. 12, coupled with s. 136 of the <i>Ontario
    Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (<i>OBCA</i>), requires Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> to make these
    advances to the former directors; and (ii) Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> loan agreement with its secured lender requires the same result.  The appellant does not contest its obligation
    to indemnify the respondents at the conclusion of the litigation, but disputes its
    obligation to make advances before that time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, which closely parallel
    those of the motion judge, I agree with her conclusion.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 1996, the respondents <span class=SpellE>Misir</span>,
    Wong and <span class=SpellE>Kinlough</span> became directors of Med-<span
class=SpellE>Chem</span> when the respondent CCFL Subordinated Debt Fund and
    Company, Limited Partnership (CCFL) provided funding to enable Med-<span
class=SpellE>Chem</span> to complete an initial public offering.  In addition to being directors, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Misir</span> was an officer of Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span>,  Mr. Wong was its corporate solicitor and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Kinlough</span> was the president of the respondent CCFL Mezzanine
    Partners of Canada Limited (CCFL Mezzanine), the general partner of CCFL. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that time, Dr. Sultan <span class=SpellE>Mahmood</span> <span class=SpellE>Alvi</span> was chairman of Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> board of directors, as well as its president and chief executive officer.  He was also the company’s controlling
    shareholder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the next two years, Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> financial situation deteriorated badly and on February 1, 1999, it was adjudged
    bankrupt.  By that time, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Kinlough</span>, Mr. Wong and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Misir</span> had all resigned as directors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> is now a discharged
    bankrupt.  Its claim in this action,
    which is driven by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Alvi</span>, is that the respondents
    breached their duties to Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> and were
    responsible for its bankruptcy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since at least 1998, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Alvi</span> has asserted that CCFL was responsible for Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> financial problems.  During the course of
    Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> bankruptcy, he sought to pursue this claim
    by having the trustee commence an action against CCFL very similar to the
    current action.  The trustee declined to
    do so, having received an opinion from external counsel that Med-<span
class=SpellE>Chem</span> had no case against CCFL.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, in 2004, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Alvi</span> commenced an action in his personal capacity as a shareholder against these
    respondents, alleging that their wrongful conduct occasioned Med-<span
class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> bankruptcy.  He
    ultimately discontinued that action. On June 9, 2005, the former directors and
    CCFL obtained a court order indemnifying them for the costs they had incurred
    in defending Dr. <span class=SpellE>Alvis</span> shareholder claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant commenced the present action on November
    23, 2007.  While the action is still at
    the pleadings stage, the former directors and CCFL have already incurred
    significant expenses in defending it.  It
    is those expenses that they now seek to recover.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dealt first with the advance of
    expenses incurred by the former directors.  She concluded that, subject to the court’s approval, Med-<span
class=SpellE>Chem’s</span> By-Law No. 12 and s. 136 of the <i>OBCA</i> require the company to reimburse these respondents for these
    expenses.  She then concluded that, in
    all the circumstances, she should exercise her discretion to approve the
    advances, and ordered that they be paid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then turned to the position of
    CCFL.  She concluded that under the terms
    of its loan agreement with Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span>, CCFL was
    entitled to advances from Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> for expenses
    incurred in defending the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, after receiving further submissions on the
    issue, the motion judge outlined the appropriate process to be used in
    determining the reasonableness of the expenses for which advancement is sought,
    and of future accounts that will be incurred by the respondents as the action
    continues.  She decided that in both
    cases, payment should be first made by Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span>, which
    shall then have the right to have those accounts assessed pursuant to the <i>Solicitors’ Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 15.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not dispute its obligation to
    indemnify the respondents at the conclusion of the litigation.  However, it contests any obligation to
    reimburse the respondents by way of advancement; that is, to reimburse them
    from time to time for litigation expenses incurred as the action
    progresses.  It raises three issues on
    this appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
    it is compelled by By-law No. 12 and s. 136 of the <i>OBCA</i> to make advances to the former directors;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
    it is compelled by its loan agreement to indemnify CCFL from time to time for
    legal fees incurred by CCFL in defending the action; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=GramE>whether</span> the motion judge erred in requiring payment prior to
    assessment pursuant to the <i>Solicitors’
    Act</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>First Issue: Advancement to the Former Directors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On
    October 29, 1996, i</span>n anticipation of the company’s initial public
    offering, Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> enacted By-law No. 12.  Article 6.3 of the By-law provides for
    indemnification by the company of designated persons who incur legal expenses
    because of their association with the company:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.3 INDEMNITY</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to the limitations contained in the Act,
    the Corporation shall indemnify a director and officer of the Corporation, a
    former director or officer, or a person who acts or acted at the Corporation’s
    request as a director or officer of a body corporate of which the Corporation
    is or was a shareholder or creditor (or a person who undertakes or has
    undertaken any liability on behalf of the Corporation or any such body
    corporate) and his heirs and legal representatives, against all damages, costs,
    charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a
    judgment, reasonably incurred by him in respect of any civil, criminal or
    administrative action or proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of
    being or having been a director or officer of the Corporation or such body
    corporate, if (a) he acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best
    interests of the Corporation or such body corporate; and (b) in the case of a
    criminal or administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by a monetary
    penalty, he had reasonable grounds for believing that his conduct was
    lawful.  The Corporation shall also
    indemnify such person in such other circumstances as the Act permits or requires.  Nothing in this By-law shall limit the right
    of any person entitled to indemnity to claim indemnity apart from the
    provisions of this By-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1.1(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i) of the
    By-law defines “Act” to be the <i>OBCA</i> as from time to time amended.  The
    relevant sections of the <i>OBCA </i> in effect at the time of the motion are the
    following:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes three arguments in contesting its
    obligation to pay advances to the former directors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it argues that the obligation to advance (which
    it disputes) is different from the obligation to indemnify (which it
    acknowledges).  Since By-law No. 12 makes
    no reference to any obligation to advance, Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> argues that it has no such obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree.  Section 6.3 of By-Law No. 12 clearly requires
    Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> to indemnify the eligible individuals in all
    those circumstances in which the <i>OBCA</i> allows indemnification.  The By-Law makes
    mandatory what the <i>OBCA</i> permits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 136(2) of the <i>OBCA</i> allows the corporation (subject to a specified repayment
    condition) to pay advances of the legal expenses that the corporation may
    indemnify under s. 136(1).  More
    importantly, s. 136(4.1), under which these proceedings are brought, allows the
    corporation to do the same (with the court’s approval), if the action is
    brought by or on behalf of the corporation itself and the individuals are made
    parties to it by virtue of their association with the corporation.  Thus, s. 136 provides for advancement of the same
    legal costs, charges and expenses that may be indemnified by the
    corporation.  In short, the legislature
    has made advancement a part of the statutory indemnification scheme,
    recognizing the reality that requiring an individual to fund his or her costs
    of litigation until its conclusion before being provided with indemnification
    would seriously impair the objective of indemnification itself.  As described by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>Blair v. Consolidated <span
class=SpellE>Endfield</span> Corp.</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 5 at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 74: “Indemnification is geared to encourage
    responsible behaviour yet still permit enough leeway to attract strong
    candidates to directorships and consequently foster entrepreneurship.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When s. 136 of the <i>OBCA</i> is read together with By-Law No. 12, the answer to the appellant’s first
    argument is clear.  The <i>OBCA</i> permits a corporation to advance
    those legal expenses that it may indemnify.  The By-law makes this mandatory.  The appellant must advance the legal expenses that it must later
    indemnify, subject only to the repayment condition in s. 136(3) and the court’s
    approval required under s. 136(4.1).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second argument is that the advancement
    provisions of s. 136(2) and s. 136(4.1) do not extend to former directors,
    since, unlike s. 136(1), former directors are not expressly referred to as eligible
    recipients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the motion judge that the answer to this
    argument is one of statutory interpretation.  Section 136(1) provides for indemnification to directors or officers,
    former directors or former officers, or other individuals acting at the
    corporation’s request for another entity as directors or officers, or in a
    similar capacity.  Under s. 136(2), those
    who qualify for advances are directors or officers, or any “other individual”
    being indemnified for legal expenses under s. 136(1).  The category of “other individual” is a broad
    one, designed to encompass in addition to directors and officers those who are
    listed in s. 136(1).  That includes
    former directors.  It is simply
    legislative shorthand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s third argument is that the motion judge
    erred in concluding that the former directors fulfilled the conditions set out
    in s. 136(3) and that, in all the circumstances, she should exercise her
    discretion under s. 136(4.1) to approve advances to them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 136(3) provides that an individual who does not
    act honestly in good faith is disqualified from being indemnified.  <i>Blair</i> says that the policy objective behind indemnification requires that individuals
    be assumed to act in good faith unless proven otherwise.  The motion judge found that, on the evidence
    before her, the <i>mala fides</i> of the
    former directors had not been established.  She went further and concluded that, given their conduct as described in
    the appellant’s own material, and the court’s previous approval of
    indemnification for them in the action brought by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Alvi</span> personally, the former directors have sufficiently established the <i>bona fides</i> of their conduct.  There was ample evidence before the motion
    judge to sustain both these conclusions and there is no basis for this court to
    interfere with them. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In deciding to exercise her discretion under s.
    136(4.1) to approve these advances, the motion judge considered a number of
    factors, all of which are relevant and reasonable in my view.  However, the appellant says that she should
    have considered: (i) whether there was proof of an inability to pay for the
    litigation without advances; (ii) the presence of insurance to fund them, and
    (iii) the respondents’ delay in seeking the advances.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no merit to these submissions.  Neither By-law No. 12, nor s. 136 of the <i>OBCA</i>, requires an inability to pay or
    the presence of insurance coverage.  Nor
    does common sense.  At an early stage of
    clearly complex litigation, any meaningful assessment of a party’s ability to
    pay would be almost impossible.  And indemnity,
    which is for the benefit of the designated individuals, ought not to be
    contingent on the existence of insurance, which is for the benefit of the
    company and which can be changed or cancelled by it.  Finally, on the facts of this case, the delay
    by the respondents in seeking advances pales in comparison with the appellant’s
    own delay in commencing the action itself.  There is no basis to interfere with this exercise of discretion by the
    motion judge.<i></i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Second Issue: Indemnification of CCFL<i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3.8 of the loan agreement between CCFL and the
    appellant reads as follows:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>3.8 Expenses
    and Legal Fees.</b>  The Borrower [Med-<span
class=SpellE>Chem</span>] agrees to pay upon demand <span class=GramE>all of
    the</span> Lender’s [CCFL] and its agents’ reasonable costs relating to the
    implementation and/or completion of the transaction herein contemplated, and to
    all other matters for which such costs may be incurred for so long as this
    Agreement shall be contemplated or in effect between the Lender and the
    Borrower.  Without limiting the
    generality of the foregoing, the Borrower agrees to pay upon demand: <span
class=GramE>...(</span>b) the reasonable legal fees and disbursements of any
    counsel retained in connection with advising the Lender generally on the
    subject matter of the transaction contemplated herein and the actions of the
    Lender hereunder and in connection with the protection and/or enforcement of
    any rights or remedies of the Lender hereunder… Until paid all such amounts
    shall be deemed to be Advances under the Credit.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the legal costs for which
    CCFL seeks indemnity fall outside this provision because they do not relate to
    the implementation or completion of the loan transaction and arose after the
    loan had been repaid.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge disagreed with this reading of s.
    3.8.  She found that the legal expenses were
    demanded of CCFL by the appellant to defend the activities of the lender during
    the course of the loan transaction that the appellant attacks in the
    litigation.  She reasoned that since
    there is no provision in s. 3.8 specifying that the obligations it provides for
    come to an end with repayment of the loan, there is no basis for the
    appellant’s complaint.  I agree.  This argument must fail.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also says that CCFL Mezzanine is not
    entitled to the benefits of s. 6.3 since it is not the lender, but the general
    partner of the lender.  I agree, and
    would not read the order appealed from to provide for that entitlement.  I think it is clear, however, that this distinction
    has no real practical effect since Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kinlough</span>, CCFL
    and CCFL <span class=SpellE>Mezzazine</span> all <span class=GramE>have</span> the same counsel providing the same services to defend the action, all of which
    will be subject to indemnification and advancement in favour of two of these
    three parties.  <i></i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Third Issue: <span class=GramE>The</span> Process to
    be Followed<i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final issue is whether the motion judge erred in
    providing for a process that requires the advances to be paid before being
    assessed for reasonableness under the <i>Solicitors’
    Act</i>.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge was well within her
    discretion and did not err in requiring that the advances she ordered be paid
    prior to assessment.  She received full
    submissions on the issue before reaching this conclusion.  She did so for the reasons she articulated at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 12 of her supplementary reasons, with which I
    agree:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept that the delay that in this case would be
    entitled in requiring an assessment before payment is contrary to the aim of an
    advance.  If the legal expenses are
    reduced on assessment, Med-<span class=SpellE>Chem</span> will be entitled to a
    refund.  In this case, there is far
    greater risk to the indemnified parties of non-payment if payment is delayed by
    an assessment than there is that the indemnified parties would fail to pay any
    required refund.  Moreover, I am prima
    facie satisfied as to the reasonableness of the portion of the expenses
    incurred to date that I am ordering be paid before an assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.  Since this means that the respondents are
    entitled to recover the legal costs that they incur in defending this action,
    there is no need for this court to make a specific order as to costs of this
    appeal.<i></i></p>
