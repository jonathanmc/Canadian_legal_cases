  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of first degree murder and
    sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for twenty five
    years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the night of the incident, the appellant claims to
    have been drinking heavily and to have taken two Percocet pills.  The deceased, nineteen year old Glen <span
class=GramE>Ivancic,</span> was unknown to the appellant and the two had never
    met until three to five minutes prior to the fatal stab wound inflicted by the
    appellant that caused Ivancic’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their interaction began when Ivancic yelled insulting
    remarks at the appellant and the appellant’s girlfriend and then bettered the
    appellant in an initial fistfight.  The
    appellant left the scene of the fight but returned within minutes with a knife.  Another fight ensued involving the appellant,
    Ivancic and Ivancic’s male companion, Justin Banwell.  The Crown alleged that the appellant
    inflicted the fatal knife wound at the outset of this second fight, while
    Ivancic was seated in the passenger seat of the car being driven by
    Banwell.  The appellant admitted stabbing
    Ivancic.  However, he testified that he
    only did so in self-defence.  According
    to the appellant, he first struck Ivancic with his fist.  Ivancic got out of the car, tackled the
    appellant to the ground, and held him down.  The appellant says that he was then attacked, both by Ivancic’s punches
    and by Banwell, who kicked him several times in the head. It was only then
    that, fearing for his life, he used the knife to stab Ivancic. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central defence advanced at trial was
    self-defence.  Failing self-defence, the
    defence took the position that the appellant lacked the requisite intent for
    murder due to the consumption of drugs and alcohol, anger and fear, while also
    relying on provocation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a two-month jury trial, the appellant was
    convicted of first degree murder. He raises grounds of appeal relating to the
    Crown’s re-examination of Banwell and use of his out-of-court statements, and
    the adequacy of the judge’s instructions relating to post-offence conduct,
    provocation, and planning and deliberation.  The appellant also submits that the first degree murder verdict is
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would set aside the
    conviction for first degree murder and substitute a conviction for second
    degree murder, but otherwise dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 26, 2003, the appellant, then 23 years
    old, worked all day as a painter and then had dinner with his family.  During the evening, he purchased a “six-pack”
    of beer, drank four bottles and then went to see his mother and brother at the
    Legion where he consumed several more bottles of beer.  He also took a Percocet tablet for his sore
    back.  Upon returning home from the
    Legion, he struck his head on the floor of the lobby of his apartment building
    during a friendly wrestling match with his brother, took another Percocet
    tablet and had two more bottles of beer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was annoyed with his girlfriend, Chanelle
    Guitard, who had gone out for the night with some friends.  When she returned after 1:30 am, they went
    for a walk and made their way to an alley by a Wendy’s restaurant next to their
    apartment building.  The appellant
    testified that, as was his habit, he carried a knife when he left the
    apartment.  They settled their
    differences and began to hug and kiss. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ivancic and Banwell had both consumed beer and
    marijuana earlier in the evening. Ivancic was irritated and on edge because of
    an insult received from an acquaintance shortly before their encounter with the
    appellant.  They proceeded towards the
    Wendy’s drive-through in a car driven by Banwell.  When they saw the appellant and his
    girlfriend kissing, Ivancic yelled: “Give it up to him right now”, or words to
    that effect. The appellant approached the vehicle and asked what the problem
    was.  Ivancic got out of the car, angry
    words were exchanged, and a fight ensued.  There was conflicting evidence as to precisely how the fight started or
    who <span class=GramE>was the main instigator</span>.  Ivancic, a larger man, quickly got the better
    of the appellant.  He pulled the
    appellant’s shirt over his head, punched the appellant several times in the
    head and threw him forcefully to the ground. Banwell joined in the attack and
    pushed the appellant to the ground a second time.  Ivancic continued to strike the appellant in
    the head. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant suffered several hard blows to his head
    and torso. Neither Ivancic nor Banwell were injured.  The appellant was very angry and upset at
    having been beaten up in front of his girlfriend.  In one but not both of his statements to the
    police, Banwell stated that the appellant threatened to “shank” or “stab”
    Ivancic.  At trial, Banwell could not
    recall that statement and the Crown sought and obtained a ruling admitting the
    police statement under the principled exception to the hearsay rule.  The appellant and his girlfriend denied that
    there had been any such threat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant returned to his apartment and sought the
    assistance of his brother. His brother was intoxicated and failed to
    respond.  The appellant got a steak knife
    from the kitchen and admitted that he told his mother “I didn’t deserve
    that.  I’m going to pay this motherfucker
    back.”  His brother’s girlfriend
    testified that he said “he’s gonna pay” or “he’s gonna get what he deserves”,
    but he denied making that statement.  He
    did not heed his mother’s advice to leave things as they were and returned to
    the Wendy’s, according to his version, with the knife concealed down the front
    of his jogging pants.  The appellant
    testified that it was his intention to produce and wave the knife to scare
    Ivancic and Banwell if they attacked him again.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant returned to Wendy’s within a matter of
    minutes after the first fight. Ivancic and Banwell had paid for their order but
    they still had not collected it.  As they
    sat in the car waiting, the appellant came up to the passenger side of their
    car.  He testified that he struck Ivancic
    with his fist through the open passenger side window.  The Crown’s theory was that the appellant
    stabbed Ivancic at that point, first in the neck and then in the chest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ivancic got out of the car and tackled the appellant to
    the ground. He held the appellant down and struck him in the face with his
    fist.  The appellant attempted to knee
    Ivancic in the groin.  Banwell joined the
    fight by delivering several hard kicks to the appellant’s head.  I will explain Banwell’s evidence of why he
    entered the fray and when he realized that Ivancic had been stabbed in greater
    detail below.  A witness at Wendy’s heard
    someone – she thought was Banwell – scream “I’ll kill you”.  The appellant testified that it was not until
    Banwell was kicking his head that, fearing for his life, he took the knife from
    his pants and slashed at Ivancic. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ivancic got off the appellant to return to the
    car.  The appellant bear-hugged Ivancic
    from behind and the two fell to the ground.  The appellant got up but Ivancic remained on the ground on his stomach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banwell turned Ivancic over and saw that he had been
    stabbed in the chest.  A pathologist
    testified that Ivancic would have died from the stab wound that pierced his
    heart within 30 to 90 seconds from the time it was inflicted.  Ivancic also suffered from a cut to his neck
    and injuries to his hands consistent with having punched someone.  He also had a bruised bladder consistent with
    the appellant’s attempt to knee him in the groin.  The appellant suffered extensive injuries to
    his neck, head, wrist and elbow and bruises to his body.  Banwell’s vehicle showed spray and droplets,
    possibly blood, on the inside of the passenger door but those spots were not
    tested and no DNA samples were taken. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown led considerable evidence of the appellant’s
    after-the-fact conduct, including the following:</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>After the stabbing, the appellant
    returned to his apartment, showered, and put his bloody clothes in a bag, while
    also putting on the clean clothes laid out by his mother at his request.  The appellant left the apartment telling
    Guitard he was going to a tree house he had built in the woods;</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>As it was too cold at the tree house, he
    proceeded to a friend’s house where he had another shower and laundered his
    clothes;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>The appellant called Guitard and asked
    her to come to the friend’s house.  He
    later called his boss and told him that he did not recall what had
    happened.  The boss told him that Ivancic
    was dead.  The appellant asked the boss
    to come to the friend’s house with his pay check and not to tell anyone where
    he was; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>When the police arrived, the appellant

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>A witness testified that she received a
    wrong-number phone call from an excited unidentified male, shouting the
    following: “Redline, Redline” And <span class=GramE>“ You</span> gotta pick us
    up.  They’re going to get us for
    murder.”  Redline is a massage parlour
    with the same phone number as that of the witness, except for one digit.  The appellant’s distant cousin worked at
    Redline.  The appellant had not seen his
    cousin fo</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>r </span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:
200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>two months and he denied knowing
    the Redline phone number or making any such call.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he consumed at least 14
    beers throughout the evening. A toxicologist testified that, based upon the
    appellant’s account of the beer he had consumed, his blood/alcohol
    concentration would be 345-395 mg/100 ml, a level at which his ability to
    reason and process information would be significantly impaired and that
    unconsciousness or memory loss would be likely.  The Crown took the position that the appellant’s clear and detailed
    recollection of the events was inconsistent with his having consumed that much
    alcohol.  Guitard testified that the
    appellant was not falling over or slurring his words, but that she could tell
    he was drunk.  However, she also adopted
    her statement to the police where she said that she could tell he was drinking
    but, “I wouldn’t say that he was drunk enough to not know what he was doing”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.    That the trial judge
    erred by </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>a</span>.     allowing the Crown to re-examine Banwell on
    a prior statement he made as to when he first saw blood on Ivancic; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>b</span>.    failing to properly instruct the jury on
    that evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.      That the trial judge’s
    jury instruction was deficient on the following grounds:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>a</span>.     the
    relevance of post-offence conduct;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>b</span>.    the
    sufficiency of the instruction as to provocation; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>c</span>.     the
    sufficiency of the instruction on planning and deliberation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.      That the verdict of
    first degree murder was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, Mr. Lockyer abandoned two grounds of
    appeal raised in his factum, namely, that certain passages in Crown counsel’s
    closing address undermined the appellant’s right to a fair trial and that the
    trial judge’s instruction on self-defence was deficient. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banwell was a crucial but difficult witness for the
    Crown.  His ability to recall and narrate
    the events of the evening of the alleged murder was uncertain, shaky and
    inconsistent. Banwell had given three prior accounts of the event.  The first was given to the police early in
    the morning following Ivancic’s death, on September 27, 2003.  That statement was video-taped but it was not
    made under oath.  Banwell’s second
    statement was given the next day, on September 28, 2003, when he provided
    police with a sworn video-taped statement. His third pre-trial statement was
    his evidence at the preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were significant differences between these prior
    statements and Banwell’s evidence at trial, where he was unable to recall
    important details of the events in question. As a result, all three prior
    statements were the subject of considerable attention at trial. The trial
    Crown, no doubt anticipating Banwell’s uncertainty on crucial points, began his
    examination-in-chief of Banwell by reminding him of his three prior statements
    and by suggesting that he might well be asked to refer to them as the
    examination proceeded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On one point, Banwell was consistent throughout: he
    never saw the appellant’s knife.  However, he gave varying accounts as to when he first saw blood on
    Ivancic and as to when he first realized that Ivancic had been stabbed.  This was obviously an important issue: the
    Crown advanced the theory that the appellant stabbed Ivancic before the second
    fight began, while the defence maintained that Ivancic was only stabbed when
    the appellant was being held on the ground by Ivancic and kicked in the head by
    Banwell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banwell testified that when the appellant came back
    after the first fight, he approached the car and started “hitting” Ivancic
    through the open window.  When asked to
    be more precise, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I don’t remember too many details.  I just remember it was kind of fast, and I
    wasn’t really looking at it that carefully, but it was just general
    hitting.  I couldn’t really tell you. I
    don’t remember.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that point, the jury was excused and Crown counsel
    reviewed with the trial judge the three pre-trial statements made by Banwell
    relating to the issue of when he first saw blood or realized that Ivancic had
    been stabbed.  Crown counsel read to the
    judge the very passage from Banwell’s September 27 statement that was
    eventually put to Banwell in re-examination and that forms the subject of this
    ground of appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Glen’s got his
    window down, or, what?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yeah, he’s, like, “You son-of-bitch”. And then
    he goes, like, that. Like, that’s all I see.  I don’t – I don’t know when he got stabbed. I think he got stabbed then,
    though, ‘cause lots of blood started coming out then.  <span class=GramE>And they – when Glen –
    after Glen got stabbed, he was fighting the guy, and – um – they were just –
    they were just rolling around and…</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Crown counsel decided at that point not to put
    that particular statement to the witness.  He explained to the trial judge: “I don’t
    actually think that [it] is appropriate to refresh memory on, on the point that
    I’m raising, but just so Your Honour has some vantage point<span class=GramE>”
    .</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When proceedings resumed the next day, Crown counsel
    took Banwell to the evidence he gave at the preliminary inquiry.  After reading the transcript, Banwell
    described the blow struck by the appellant through the car window as “sort of
    like jab, punching kind of motion”.  He
    then described how Ivancic got out of the car, tackled the appellant to the
    ground, got on top of the appellant and hit him a couple of times.  At that point, Banwell testified that he
    thought that there was something wrong with Ivancic, that his “body was kind of
    limp”.  Banwell said that he then
    delivered about five hard kicks to the appellant’s face.  Ivancic then got up to go back to the car and
    the appellant bear-hugged him from behind.  Banwell described hitting the appellant on the back of the head with
    several hard punches.  According to
    Banwell, Ivancic then fell to the ground on his stomach with the appellant on
    top.  The appellant got up but Ivancic
    did not.  Banwell testified that he then
    nudged Ivancic with his foot to get him up and then tried to pick him up.  Her further testified: “and then I – actually,
    I turned him over, and that’s when I saw like, a bloodstain on his chest”,
    which he described as a six to eight inch circle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In examination-in-chief, Banwell could not recall the
    appellant threatening to “shank” or “stab” Ivancic.  The Crown brought an application to have
    portions of the September 28 sworn statement admitted as past recollection
    recorded pursuant to the principled approach to hearsay.  After conducting a lengthy <i>voir dire</i> during which all three of
    Banwell’s prior statements were thoroughly canvassed, including Banwell’s
    various accounts of when he first saw blood or realized that Ivancic had been
    stabbed, the trial judge ruled that portions of the September 28 statement
    should be admitted.  Those portions
    included Banwell’s recollection that, after the first fight, the appellant said
    “I’m gonna shank you or something”; “something about stabbing him”; “I’ll get
    you stabbed or I’m gonna stab you or something along those lines”; but nothing
    about when Banwell first saw blood or realized that Ivancic had been stabbed
    during the second fight. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An edited videotape containing those portions was
    played for the jury and Banwell’s examination-in-chief continued.  Crown counsel concluded his
    examination-in-chief by asking Banwell the following: “when is the first time
    that you are aware of blood in relation to Mr. Ivancic?”  Banwell first answered that it was probably
    when he turned Ivancic over on the ground.  He then testified that he had seen blood earlier when he entered the
    fray by kicking the appellant in the head, which he assumed came from the
    appellant, when Ivancic was on top of the appellant.  He added that, in hindsight, it could have
    been Ivancic’s blood that he saw at that point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel used Banwell’s prior statements to
    point out several inconsistencies in his evidence.  Banwell said nothing to the police on
    September 27 about the appellant’s threat to shank or stab Ivancic after the
    first fight.  At the preliminary inquiry,
    he testified that the appellant struck Ivancic two or three times, not four or
    five times.  He agreed that on September
    28, he told the police that the first time he saw blood was when Ivancic was on
    his stomach.  In his September 28
    statement, he also told the police that he could not tell that Ivancic was hurt
    when he was on top of, and fighting, the appellant and that he thought Ivancic
    was going to “get up and kick this guy’s ass”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel pressed Banwell on the issue of when he
    first saw blood or realized that Ivancic had been seriously injured.  He answered that he recalled seeing blood
    when Ivancic was on top of the appellant, blood that was “dripping down” and
    “flowing like syrup”, but that he was not sure whether the blood was coming
    from the appellant or Ivancic.  For the
    purposes of the ground of appeal, the crucial portion of the cross-examination
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.   The officer asked you if you could see any blood around Glen, <span
class=GramE>correct?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.   Mm-hmm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.   You were allowed to take your time before you
    answered, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.   Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.   You said he was on his stomach?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.   Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.   <span class=GramE>All right,</span> and you
    couldn’t – basically, you couldn’t see any blood, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.   No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.   All right, but you never said anything about
    seeing blood dripping or anything like that before, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.   Yeah, but it’s something – it’s something
    that kind of burned in my memory.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.   But, you don’t recall it here, eh?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.   No, but I’ve been over it numerous times, and at that point, I was
    trying to get it out of my head whether I liked it or not, but there’s a lot of
    stuff that does come back when you – when you have time to really think about
    it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After further cross-examination, Barnwell agreed that
    until he turned Ivancic over, he did not realize that there was anything
    seriously wrong with him nor that he had been stabbed until he saw the stab
    wound after turning him over.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel re-examined Banwell on a number of points
    not at issue on this appeal and then turned to the portion of Banwell’s
    September 27 statement to the police, quoted above at paragraph 24. Defence
    counsel objected by pointing out that this was improper re-examination.  The Crown argued that the defence had opened
    the door to this line of questioning by alleging recent fabrication with the
    following question: “All right, but you never said anything about seeing blood
    dripping or anything like that before, right?”  The trial judge allowed the Crown to continue on the basis that this
    “was a piece of [the] puzzle” that the jury should know, and that it flowed
    from the cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel then played the passage from the video
    set out above at paragraph 24, and the following questions and answers ensued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Did you hear that, sir?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Did you indicate at any time to the police
    whether or not you saw blood prior to the rolling him over?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    I don’t remember if I did, ‘<span
class=GramE>cause</span> I don’t remember if I remembered that at that point.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Can you please explain that last answer?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    All right.  <i>Well, I remember something like
    that now,</i> but I don’t know if I said it then, because I didn’t have – I
    didn’t – I don’t – I think I forgot about that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Did you just tell the police that in that
    video statement?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Just then?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Yes?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Uh….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Was that you in the video?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Yes, that was me in the video.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Is that the answer that you gave?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    No, I don’t think so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Okay, can you help with me that?  In the video that we just saw there?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.    Is that someone else answering than you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    No, that was me.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred, first
    by allowing the Crown to re-examine Banwell on a prior statement he made as to
    when he first saw blood on Ivancic; and second, by failing properly to instruct
    the jury on how to treat that evidence.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>(a) Did the trial judge err by allowing the Crown to
    re-examine on this statement?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that Crown counsel was clearly
    aware of the statement and that he must have made a strategic decision to hold
    it back during examination-in-chief in order to gain an advantage by using it
    in re-examination and thereby having the last word. In any event, the appellant
    submits that the Crown gained an unfair advantage by being allowed to
    re-examine on the September 27 statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the submission that the Crown deliberately
    held back the September 27 statement to use on re-examination in order to gain
    a strategic advantage is not supported by the record.  As I have already noted, Crown counsel made
    the trial judge aware of the statement when he referred to it earlier during
    submissions but indicated that he did so only by way of background, and stated
    that he did consider it to be appropriate at that point in the trial to use the
    statement to refresh Banwell’s memory.  I
    have no reason to doubt the sincerity of that submission.  It amounted to a concession that the Crown
    could not use the statement unless something else transpired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, something else did transpire, namely the
    defence cross-examination of Banwell.  In
    my view, it was open to the trial judge to find that the tenor of the
    cross-examination and, in particular, the passage I have quoted, evidenced that
    Banwell had never told the police that he had seen blood from Ivancic until the
    very end when he rolled Ivancic over.  Defence counsel had taken Banwell through a detailed review of the
    various statements he had made in an attempt to make that point.  The detailed review did not, however, include
    the passage from the September 27 statement where Banwell told the police that
    he had seen blood earlier.  This could have
    left the jury with an incorrect impression as to the tenor of Banwell’s statements
    to the police.  Crown counsel had
    initially refrained from leading the September 27 statement because he felt
    that it would not be proper to do so during Banwell’s examination-in-chief, but
    the situation changed as a result of the cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the words of Martin J.A.’s oft-cited judgment in <i>R. v. Moore</i> (1984), 5 O.A.C. 51 (C.A.) (leave
    to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1985] S.C.C.A. No. 248) at p. 70, re-examination
    ordinarily “must be confined to matters arising in cross-examination” although
    the trial judge does have the discretion to allow the facts to be introduced
    and afford the opposite party the right to cross-examine on any new facts.  The law on this issue was recently explained
    by Watt J.A. in <i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Candir </i>(2009), 257 O.A.C. 119, at para. 148:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is fundamental that the permissible scope of
    re-examination is linked to its purpose and the subject-matter on which the
    witness has been cross-examined.&nbsp; The purpose of re-examination is largely
    rehabilitative and explanatory. The witness is afforded the opportunity, under
    questioning by the examiner who called the witness in the first place, to
    explain, clarify or qualify answers given in cross-examination that are
    considered damaging to the examiner’s case.&nbsp; The examiner has no right to
    introduce new subjects in re-examination, topics that should have been covered,
    if at all, in examination in-chief of the witness.&nbsp; A trial judge has <span
class=GramE>a discretion</span>, however, to grant leave to the party calling a
    witness to introduce new subjects in re-examination, but must afford the
    opposing party the right of further cross-examination on the new facts. [Citation
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the characterization of the
    cross-examination as suggesting “recent invention” on Banwell’s part and,
    before us, the respondent did not seek to justify the re-examination on that
    basis.  However, it is my opinion that
    the re-examination may be properly justified as having been linked to its
    rehabilitative and explanatory purpose and to the subject-matter on which the
    witness has been cross-examined.&nbsp;  The cross-examination canvassed Banwell’s statements to the police in
    some considerable detail and suggested that Banwell had never told the police
    that he saw blood before he turned Ivancic over.  This was not a full and accurate picture of
    the statements Banwell had made. In my view, the trial judge was entitled to
    conclude that the cross-examination had opened the door to the Crown’s request
    to put the September 27 statement to Banwell on re-examination, in order to
    avoid a situation where the jury would be left with a partial and misleading
    appreciation of the tenor of Banwell’s statements to the police on this crucial
    issue.  I agree with the respondent that
    the re-examination was properly permitted to correct the erroneous impression,
    left after the cross-examination, that Banwell had never said he saw blood
    before rolling Ivancic over. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that there was any error or trial
    unfairness arising from the re-examination and, accordingly, I would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>(b) Instruction as to the evidence given by Banwell in
    re-examination</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to
    provide the jury with an adequate instruction as to the use it could make of
    the September 27 statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I start my analysis of this issue by referring to what
    occurred in the pre-charge conference the trial judge conducted in order to
    review his draft charge.  Initially,
    defence counsel took the position that Banwell had not adopted the September 27
    statement and that the jury should be instructed that it was therefore not
    admissible for the truth of its contents. However, defence counsel eventually
    agreed that Banwell’s statement, “Well, I remember something like that now”,
    was capable of supporting a finding that he had adopted his prior
    statement.  If “<span lang=EN-GB>there is an evidentiary basis on which the
    trier of fact could conclude that the [witness] adopted the statement”, the
    determination of whether a witness adopted all or any part of a prior statement
    is matter for the trier of fact: <i>R. v. Toten </i>(1993)<i>,</i> 14 O.R. (3d)
    225 (C.A.), at p. 242.  At the pre-charge
    conference, </span>defence counsel acknowledged that the issue of whether
    Banwell recalled making the statement or was recalling the incident itself was
    a question for the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge did not explicitly charge the
    jury on the issue of whether Banwell had adopted the September 27 statement in
    re-examination, he properly instructed the jury with respect to prior
    inconsistent statements, generally:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>Whatever
    you choose to make of the differences, you can only use the testimony given
    under oath in this trial as evidence of what actually happened.  You cannot use the earlier statement as
    evidence of what actually <span class=GramE>happened,</span> unless you are
    satisfied the witness accepted it as true while in the witness box.  Even then, like the evidence of any witness,
    it is for you to say whether or how much you will believe of, or rely upon it
    in reaching your decision.  However,
    there are exceptions to what I have just told you concerning Justin Banwell,
    Janice Stiers, and Pam Garrod.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-GB>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
    trial judge then went on to explain to the jury how it should deal with the
    evidence of the three named witnesses with respect to statements they had
    reported being made to them by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-GB>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Clearly,
    Banwell’s evidence as to when he saw blood or when he realized that Ivancic had
    been stabbed was problematic.  He was
    examined and cross-examined on his various prior out-of-court statements and he
    was shown to be unable to give a consistent account of the incident.  The trial judge’s instruction must be
    considered in the light of what was said during the pre-charge conference and
    what was said by both <span class=GramE>counsel</span> during their closing
    submissions. Crown counsel invited the jury to find that Banwell had adopted
    the statement, thereby reinforcing the need for the jury to find that he
    adopted it before relying upon it for the truth of its contents.  I find it significant that in his closing
    address, defence counsel quoted verbatim the disputed passage from the
    September 27 statement, as well as the portion of the re-examination relied
    upon by the Crown as amounting to an adoption of the statement.  Defence counsel used this apparent
    contradiction to attack Banwell’s evidence in the following terms: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>What
    accounts for this person’s amazing, I would submit to you, memory or lack
    thereof. Is he now claiming to forget, consistently claiming to forget what he
    has previously said which is not true as a convenient way out of a <span
class=GramE>conflict.</span> Conflict between <span class=GramE>loyalty</span>,
    a conflict with the truth, a conflict with what was previously said, a conflict
    with reality that I previously addressed with you.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-GB>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>This
    passage, when read in tandem with defence counsel’s earlier pre-charge
    conference concession that the issue of adoption was one for the jury, coupled
    with an absence of any objection to the charge, fortifies my view that the
    appellant was not prejudiced by the manner in which the trial judge dealt with
    the September 27 statement.  The defence
    decided to confront the issue of Banwell’s various out-of-court statements head-on.  It further elected to fight the issue of when
    the appellant stabbed Ivancic on the basis that Banwell was so unsure of what
    had transpired and equally inconsistent in his various accounts of what had
    happened, with a view to demonstrating that his evidence was simply
    unreliable.  Thus, from the defence’s
    perspective, the issue was not whether Banwell had adopted the impugned
    statement.  Instead, the defence decided
    to use the statement as yet another instance of Banwell’s inability to give a
    consistent account of the events.</span></p>

    instruction on provocation was inadequate because it failed to relate the

    appellant had “acted on the sudden before his passion cooled”: see <i>R. v. Olbey</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008, at p.
    1022.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did instruct the jury that, to consider
    the subjective branch of the test for provocation, “you must take into account
    Kevin Stier’s mental, emotional and physical condition.”  This was immediately preceded by a detailed
    instruction on the relevance of intoxication to the appellant’s mental
    state.  That instruction specifically
    related the relevance of intoxication to provocation in the following fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You should consider this evidence [of intoxication]
    as well, apart altogether from what I’ll tell you later about provocation not just
    by itself on the particular issue to which it relates, but altogether, and
    along with other evidence that might suggest that Kevin Stiers acted
    instinctively, or in the sudden excitement of the moment, without thinking
    about the consequences of what he did, and without either state of mind
    necessary to make the unlawful killing of Glen Ivancic murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, read as a whole and in the context of this
    case, the trial judge provided the jury with an adequate instruction on the
    relevance of intoxication to provocation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><i><span

    conduct</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have indicated, the Crown led a significant body
    of evidence relating to the appellant’s conduct following the stabbing as
    circumstantial evidence of his guilt. <span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the trial judge’s instructions to
    the jury on the relevance of this evidence were inadequate, as the trial judge
    failed to instruct the jury that while the post-offence conduct could be
    probative of the appellant’s participation in an unlawful homicide, it had no
    probative value on the determination of his level of culpability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find that Kevin
    Stiers did in fact do or say these things, you should consider next whether
    this was because Kevin Stiers committed the offense charged or for some other
    reason. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find what Kevin Stiers said or did
    afterwards is consistent with him being conscious of having done what is
    alleged against him, and not for some other reason, you may consider this
    evidence, together with all the other evidence, in reaching your verdict. If
    you do not or cannot find that Kevin Stiers said or did those things for that
    reason, you must not consider this evidence in that way. It is for you to
    decide based on the evidence as a whole whether Kevin Stiers’ after the fact
    conduct is not attributable to the charge but that, for example, he was scared
    and wanted time to think clearly. It is for you to decide whether the after the
    fact conduct was related to the charge before you rather than to some other
    possible culpable act. It is for you to consider whether the weight, if any,
    such evidence should be accorded in your final determination of guilt or
    innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that, where an accused person
    has been charged with a more serious offence, such as first degree murder,
    evidence of flight or other like conduct may be probative of the individual’s commission
    of an unlawful homicide but is not ordinarily probative of his level of culpability
    and, hence, has no probative value as to whether the offence was a first or
    second degree murder or manslaughter: see <i>R.
    v. Arcangioli,</i> [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129; <i>R.
    v. White</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72; <i>R. v.
    Peavoy</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the relevance of evidence of post-offence
    conduct will depend upon the nature of the conduct, the facts sought to be
    inferred from it, the positions advanced by the Crown and the accused, and the
    totality of the evidence.  Further, it
    follows that “no prefabricated rule stamps certain kinds of after-the-fact
    conduct as always or never relevant to a particular fact in issue”: see <i>R. v. Cudjoe </i>(2009), 251 O.A.C. 163, at paras. <span lang=FR-CA>78-79; <i>R.
    v. Figueroa </i>(2008), 233 O.A.C. 176 (C.A.), at paras. </span>34-35.
    Accordingly, it has been held that where the accused’s mental state is in
    issue, for example, through evidence of intoxication, evidence of the accused’s
    after-the-fact conduct could support an inference that, despite intoxication,
    the accused did have sufficient awareness to form the requisite intent for
    murder: see <i>Peavoy</i>, at pp. 631-32. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondent that this was not a case
    for an instruction that the evidence of after-the-fact conduct had “no
    probative value”.  The after-the-fact
    conduct evidence was relevant in two ways.  First, as the appellant relied on self-defence as a way to excuse the
    killing, his after-the-fact conduct could be used to infer his awareness of
    having committed a culpable homicide.  Second, the evidence of the appellant’s purposeful conduct after the offence
    was probative of his mental state and capacity immediately following the
    stabbing and, therefore, was arguably relevant to the issue of his capacity to
    form the requisite intention for murder or to commit a planned and deliberate
    murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The more difficult question is whether the trial judge
    should have given a more nuanced instruction explaining the relevance of the after-the-fact
    conduct on an issue-by-issue basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on the decision of this court in <i>Peavoy</i>, where Weiler J.A., writing for herself and Doherty and
    Moldaver JJ.A., stated the following, at pp. 631-32:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the
    appellant’s admission that he had stabbed Mr. George, the after-the-fact
    circumstantial evidence had no relevance with respect to the commission of the
    physical act. Although the appellant admitted to stabbing the deceased, he did
    not admit that he had committed any culpable act but testified that he had
    acted in self-defence. In these circumstances, the after-the-fact conduct was
    some evidence from which, along with other evidence, the jury could infer that
    the appellant was aware he had committed a culpable act and had not acted in
    self-defence. If the jury concluded that the appellant had committed a culpable
    homicide, the evidence could not be used as evidence that the appellant
    intended to commit murder as opposed to manslaughter. However, because the
    defence contended that the Crown had not proven the requisite intent for murder
    due to the appellant’s drinking throughout the day and at the time of the
    killing, the after-the-fact conduct could be used in support of the inference
    that, despite the appellant’s intoxication, he had sufficient awareness to have
    formed the requisite intent for murder. The evidence suggested a relatively high
    level of cognitive functioning and purposeful conduct which could be viewed as
    antithetical to intoxication.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It may not
    be necessary in all cases for a trial judge to instruct a jury as to the
    permissible uses of after-the-fact conduct.  In the present case, however, the evidence of the after-the-fact conduct
    formed a significant part of the case against the appellant and there was a
    danger that the evidence would be misused unless the jury were properly
    instructed.  The trial judge should have
    specifically told the jury that the evidence was relevant to only two issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>–<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Had the
    Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant committed a culpable
    homicide and did not act in self-<span class=GramE>defence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>–<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Had the
    Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that, despite the appellant’s
    intoxication, he had the requisite intent for <span class=GramE>murder.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial
    judge’s non-direction combined with his failure to correct the misstatement by
    Crown counsel as to the use of the evidence resulted in reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the trial judge could have
    instructed the jury that the after-the-fact conduct could have a bearing on: </p>
  <p>1.    Whether the Crown had proved that the
    appellant had committed a culpable homicide and did not act in self-defence; </p>
  <p>2.    Whether
    the Crown had proved that the appellant had the requisite intent for second
    degree murder and had committed a planned and deliberate murder; but </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>it</span> had no probative value as to  </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3.    The appellant’s consciousness of having
    committed second or first degree murder, as opposed to manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is my view that a more nuanced instruction along the
    lines I have outlined above would have been preferable, particularly given the
    tenuous nature of the case for first degree murder, a point upon which I will
    expand below.  However, such an
    instruction would certainly introduce a level of complexity that the trial
    judge might wish to avoid.  As recently
    noted by Watt J.A. in <i>Cudjoe</i>, at
    para. 90, an instruction along these lines may be difficult to follow or might even
    seem contradictory in that the jury is being told not to use the evidence to
    determine the accused’s level of culpability but, at the same time, to use the
    evidence to determine a mental state evincing the accused’s level of
    culpability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The after-the-fact conduct evidence did have a bearing
    on the appellant’s level of culpability in the event that the jury rejected
    self-defence and, as frequently stated, the treatment of after-the-fact conduct
    is highly case-specific.  This necessarily
    implies affording the trial judge leeway in crafting an appropriate
    instruction.  In the end, I am not
    persuaded that this shortcoming in the charge, standing on its own, amounts to
    reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal although it does have a bearing on my treatment of the verdict of first
    degree murder. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.
    Unreasonable verdict</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the reasonableness of the verdict has a bearing on
    my assessment of the adequacy of the trial judge’s instruction on planning and
    deliberation, I will discuss it before turning to that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that the verdict of guilty on the first
    degree murder charge was unreasonable.  The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a directed verdict on
    first degree murder, and no appeal is taken from that ruling.  There was some evidence of planning – the
    threat to “shank” or stab, returning home to get the knife, and returning to
    the scene to launch a surprise attack through the open car window. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More problematic for the Crown was the element of
    deliberation. It is well established that the word ‘deliberate’ connotes
    “considered”, “not impulsive”, “slow in deciding”, “cautious” and implies that
    the accused must take time to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of his
    intended action: see <i>R. v. Widdifield </i>(1961),
    6 Crim. L.Q. 152 (Ont. H.C.J.), at p. 153; <i>R.
    v. Reynolds</i> (1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 353 (C.A.), at pp. 362-63. The entire
    exchange between the time the deceased insulted the appellant and the moment the
    appellant inflicted the fatal stab wound upon him lasted only three to five
    minutes.  The appellant had been drinking
    and he had consumed drugs.  He had been
    badly beaten in the head in the first fight and was very angry at being shamed
    in front of his girlfriend.  He stabbed
    the deceased in full view, either in the car or while he was on the ground, in
    a public place near a drive-through restaurant and close to his own
    residence.  Absent self-defence, there was
    of course nothing in any of this to excuse his conduct, but that is not the
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the evidence in this case sufficient to establish
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Ivancic’s death was the result of a “planned and
    deliberate act”?  Did the appellant’s
    conduct exhibit a reflective and thoughtful mental process sufficient to
    constitute first degree murder?  Could it
    be more readily characterized as a drink, drug and anger-fuelled impulsive
    reaction to an insult and a bad beating, bringing it more readily within the category
    of second degree murder or manslaughter?  There was scarcely time for deliberation as the turmoil that produced
    the fatal wound, precipitated by drugs and alcohol, passion, trauma from the
    initial fight and anger hardly allowed for the reflective and thoughtful mental
    process required in order to amount to deliberation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that, ultimately, these were questions for the
    jury to decide and I cannot say that the verdict was unreasonable.  However, a verdict of first degree murder was
    only barely attainable on the facts of this case, thereby highlighting the
    importance of an appropriate instruction from the trial judge.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>4.
    Planning and deliberation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the jury an appropriate
    explanation of the legal meaning of “planning and deliberation” for first
    degree murder.  The appellant takes no
    issue with the correctness of that definition.  The appellant submits, however, that the instruction was deficient, as
    it merely provided the jury with an abstract definition of the term but failed
    to instruct the jury on the application of that definition to the particular
    facts and context of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have just explained, I do not accept the
    appellant’s contention that the verdict of first degree murder should be set
    aside as unreasonable.  However, the case
    for first degree murder was tenuous and a careful instruction to the jury was apposite.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is significant that, well into its deliberations,
    the jury asked the following question, indicating uncertainty about how to
    apply the definition provided by the trial judge on the meaning of “planned and
    deliberate”: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Your Honour, we need a
    clarification of the definition of planned. One, does a plan by definition
    include a specific result that is e.g., “plan to murder,” murder being included
    in the plan? ... Can the plan be more generic without a result in the plan?
    E.g., a plan to act is a <span class=GramE>plan ...</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Two, does “deliberate” include the final result of
    murder? Can an act be deliberate (such as deliberate bodily harm) without
    knowing the result? Does the final result need to be considered by the actor
    before the act?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury’s question raised fundamental issues about the
    planning and deliberation and suggested both a failure to fully grasp the
    meaning of the phrase and difficulty with the application of the legal
    definition provided to the facts of the case to be decided.  The trial judge answered the question by
    repeating what he had already mentioned about the definition but neither in his
    initial charge nor in his answer to this question did he highlight or otherwise
    examine the evidence the jury needed to consider in deciding the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case and in light of the
    jury’s question concerning planning and deliberation, a more careful
    instruction, tailored to the facts, was required.  There is ample support for the proposition
    that it is incumbent upon the trial judge to direct the jury to the evidence
    bearing upon the issue of planning and deliberation, particularly where the
    Crown’s case for a verdict of first degree murder is weak. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. Frisbee</i> (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 386 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1989]
    S.C.C.A. No. 232, stands for the proposition that, especially where there are
    weaknesses in the Crown’s case that the murder was planned and deliberate, it
    is essential for the trial judge to assist the jury by relating the facts of
    the case to the legal definition of ‘planned and deliberate’.  Writing for the court, Esson J.A. stated the
    following, at p. 428:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was evidence which was capable of supporting
    a finding of planning and deliberation. On the other hand, there were
    weaknesses in that aspect of the Crown case and there was much in the
    circumstances of the killing which could create a basis for doubting that it
    was planned and deliberate. Of these matters, virtually nothing was said in the
    charge to directly relate them to planning and deliberation as distinct from
    intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Maciel</i> (2007), 222 O.A.C. 174 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2007]
    S.C.C.A. No. 258, at para. 96, Doherty J.A. stated that in a case where “the
    question of whether the murder was first or second degree was very much a live
    issue ... [i]t was essential that the trial judge draw the jury’s attention to
    the evidence that could assist them in distinguishing between first and second
    degree murder, should the jury conclude that the appellant was guilty of murder.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Related to this is the failure of the trial judge to
    give an explicit direction that, even if the jury found that the evidence of
    intoxication was insufficient to negate the intent to kill required for second
    degree murder, it could still negate planning and deliberation. Intoxication
    falling short of undermining the intent required for second degree murder is
    still relevant to the issue of planning and deliberation, as it may raise a
    reasonable doubt as to the accused’s ability to plan and deliberate or make the
    accused more susceptible to the commission of an impulsive act: see <i>R. v. Wallen</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 827, at pp.
    834-35.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the circumstances of this case called for a
    careful instruction on planning and deliberation that went beyond providing an abstract
    legal <span class=GramE>definition,</span> and that was specifically tailored
    to the facts at hand, including the evidence of intoxication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would give effect to this ground of

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have concluded that the trial judge failed to provide
    the jury with an adequate instruction in relation to the application of the
    definition of “planning and deliberation” to the facts of this case.  I have also found that while not an error, it
    would have been preferable had the trial judge provided the jury with additional
    guidance on the use it could make of the post-offence evidence.  That shortcoming in the instruction had a
    bearing on whether the jury convicted the appellant of first or second degree
    murder. While I do not conclude that the verdict of first degree murder was
    unreasonable, in my view, it was tainted by the error I have identified and,
    given the tenuous factual basis for first degree murder, the verdict cannot
    stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its factum, the Crown takes the position that if we
    find that the trial judge erred on planning and deliberation, we should not
    order a new trial but rather substitute a conviction for second degree
    murder.  That is precisely what occurred
    in <i>Maciel</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal pursuant to s.
    686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which allows this court to dismiss the appeal where it
    is of the opinion that the appellant was not properly convicted on a count or
    part of an indictment but properly convicted on another count or part of the
