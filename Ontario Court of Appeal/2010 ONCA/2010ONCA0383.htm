  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These companion appeals involve the consideration of
    two decisions rendered by an arbitrator and the subsequent applications to have
    both decisions set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whitney Graham was injured in a car accident on June
    25, 2003, when the van in which she was a passenger collided with a taxi.  The van was driven by David Parrell.  The taxi was insured by Lombard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Graham submitted an application for accident
    benefits to Wawanesa on July 21, 2003, in which she indicated that Mr.
    Parrell’s van was insured by Wawanesa.  Wawanesa returned the application to Ms. Graham on July 25, 2003, with a
    note written on it to the effect that Mr. Parrell’s policy had lapsed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Graham then sent the same application for accident
    benefits to Lombard.  Shortly thereafter,
    Lombard began paying her accident benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some four years later, Lombard sent out a “Notice to Applicant
    of Dispute <span class=GramE>Between</span> Insurers”.  It also sent <span class=SpellE>Wawanesa</span> a “Notice Demanding Arbitration” (the “Priority Dispute Arbitration”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed that Wawanesa was the first insurer
    to receive a completed application for accident benefits.  Section 2 of O. Reg. 283/95 (the
    “Regulation”) requires the first insurer to receive a completed application for
    accident benefits to pay benefits, pending the resolution of any dispute as to
    which insurer is required to pay benefits under s. 268 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the first preliminary hearing, Arbitrator Novick
    held that Wawanesa breached s. 2 of the Regulation by “deflecting” the
    application. She further held that <span class=SpellE>Wawanesa</span> could not
    rely on s. 3 of the Regulation to prevent Lombard from disputing its obligation
    to pay benefits, even though Lombard failed to provide notice of its intention
    to do so within ninety days of receipt of the application, as required by s. 3
    of the Regulation.  Section 3(1) provides
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No insurer may dispute its obligation to pay
    benefits under section 268 of the Act unless it gives written notice within 90
    days of receipt of a completed application for benefits to every insurer who it
    claims is required to pay under that section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator ordered that the Priority Dispute
    Arbitration should proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her second preliminary decision, Arbitrator Novick
    held that even though Wawanesa breached s. 2 of the Regulation and did not give
    notice under s. 3(1), it was not precluded from disputing who the priority
    insurer was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wawanesa brought an application asking that the first
    preliminary decision be set aside and for an order that Lombard had priority to
    pay Whitney Graham’s accident benefits.  Lombard
    brought an application asking that the second preliminary decision be set aside
    and for an order precluding <span class=SpellE>Wawanesa</span> from continuing
    to dispute that it was the priority insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Belobaba heard the applications.  He agreed with the arbitrator’s reasoning and <span class=GramE>result</span> in both preliminary decisions and dismissed the
    applications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the first preliminary decision, the
    applications judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with the arbitrator’s interpretation of ss.
    2 and 3 of Reg. 283/95.  If Wawanesa, as
    the “first insurer” refuses an application to pay benefits and breaches s. 2
    and fails to provide the required notice under s. 3, it cannot then “take the
    offensive” and point the finger at Lombard, the second insurer (who receives
    the application and pays the benefits) for failing to comply with the notice
    requirement in s. 3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge also found that the arbitrator
    had correctly summarized and applied the relevant case law and the underlying
    policy of the Regulation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the second preliminary decision, the
    applications judge agreed with the arbitrator that this court’s decision in <i>Kingsway General Insurance Co. v. Ontario
    (Minister of Finance) </i>(2007), 84 O.R. (3d) 507 (C.A.),<i> </i>was determinative.  He
    concluded that even though Wawanesa ought to have paid benefits pending a
    determination of whether it was an “insurer” (i.e. whether the Parrell policy
    had been validly cancelled)<span class=GramE>,</span> Wawanesa ought not to be
    required to pay benefits permanently.  He
    held that the arbitrator had correctly concluded, based on <i>Kingsway</i>, that “a breach of s. 2, while a serious matter that
    deserves sanction, does not result in an insurer automatically being required
    to pay benefits to the claimant forever”.  Thus, the applications judge held that the arbitrator correctly ruled
    that the Priority Dispute Arbitration had to proceed to determine whether a
    valid Wawanesa policy existed at the time of the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wawanesa appeals the order upholding the first
    preliminary decision.  Its main argument
    on appeal is the same as that advanced at both levels below.  It submits that because Lombard did not
    comply with the 90-day notice requirement in s. 3(1) of the Regulations and it
    did not satisfy the two-part “saving provision” in s. 3(2), Lombard was barred
    from disputing priority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lombard appeals the order upholding the second
    preliminary decision.  It too advances
    the same arguments as were made below.  In sum, it contends that as Wawanesa was in breach of both ss. 2 and 3
    of the Regulations, it is not now entitled to dispute its obligation to pay
    benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, we see no error in
    the reasoning and results below.  Accordingly, we would dismiss both appeals.  Like the applications judge, we do so for the
    reasons given by the arbitrator in the two preliminary decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Success being divided, there will be no order as to
    costs.</p>
