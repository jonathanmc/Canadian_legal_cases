  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard Ayotte and Bell Mobility Inc. appeal from the
    judgment and costs order of <span class=SpellE>Aitken</span> J. dated June 9,
    2009.  The trial judge found Ayotte
    personally liable for the torts of battery and intentional and negligent
    infliction of mental suffering.  She also
    found Bell Mobility vicariously liable for the torts committed by Ayotte, and
    directly liable for negligence and constructive dismissal.  She awarded the respondent, Marta
    Piresferreira, damages totalling $500,955.  She also awarded $15,000 to Piresferreira’s partner under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, as
    damages for the loss of guidance, care and companionship.  She held Ayotte and Bell Mobility jointly and
    severally liable for all these amounts.  She
    also awarded Piresferreira costs of the action and trial in the amount of
    $225,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal the quantum of damages the trial
    judge awarded for battery, her findings of liability for intentional and
    negligent infliction of mental suffering, her finding that Piresferreira had
    not failed to mitigate her damages, the damages awarded to Piresferreira’s
    partner and the costs award.  I would
    allow the appeal in part.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would find that the trial judge erred by finding the tort
    of negligence was available against an employer and supervisor for conduct in
    the course of the respondent’s employment, by finding that the tort of
    intentional infliction of mental suffering had been made out and in assessing
    the damages for battery.  I would
    attribute the general damages the trial judge awarded for these torts to
    damages for mental suffering under the framework of <i>Honda Canada Inc. v. <span class=SpellE>Keays</span></i>, [2008] 2
    S.C.R. 362. I would award the respondent an additional $15,000 damages for the
    tort of battery.  I would reject the
    appellants’ contention that Piresferreira failed to mitigate her damages and
    would maintain the 12 months’ wages the trial judge awarded in lieu of
    reasonable notice, but I would set aside the additional lost wages she awarded
    as tort damages.   I would set aside the damages
    the trial judge awarded to <span class=SpellE>Piresferreira’s</span> partner for
    the loss of guidance, care and companionship.      </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Factual background</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the time of the incident, Piresferreira had
    been an employee of Bell Mobility for some 10 years.  She worked in Bell Mobility’s Ottawa office
    from January 1997 to May 2005 as one of six account managers under the
    supervision of Ayotte, who was the sales manager.  Except for the year 2000, Piresferreira
    received excellent performance reviews every year until 2004.  Her mid-term and year-end 2004 performance
    reviews prepared by Ayotte indicated she needed to improve her performance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ayotte was a critical, demanding, loud and aggressive
    manager.  Other employees corroborated Piresferreira’s
    testimony that he would yell and swear at employees, had a temper, and would
    bang his fist on the table to make a point.  He had high expectations for the account managers on his team.  Other employees described Piresferreira as
    nervous and sensitive, not taking responsibility for problems but instead
    blaming others, and not dealing well with criticism <span style='line-height:200%'>–</span> regardless of how it was delivered.  The two personalities could hardly be less
    complementary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Commencing in 2004, Ayotte became more verbally
    abusive of everyone on the team, but particularly of Piresferreira.  As noted, Ayotte strongly criticized
    Piresferreira in her 2004 year-end performance appraisal.  In his closing comments in the appraisal, he
    said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Marta had a very disappointing year. She has had a
    lot of trouble accepting these results and at times has been quite
    controversial when help was offered or suggestions were made. She often gets
    emotional when things are not going right and as a result may make some of her
    peers uncomfortable. She needs to get a grip on her situation and work on it in
    a calm manner.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In her attempt to inform people in problem
    situations, she is forgetting that she needs to take ownership of these
    problems and follow them through rather than pass them on.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In 2005, she must become strategic in the direction
    that she wants to approach her accounts. I will work with her in achieving this
    objective. Marta has been a top performer in the past and I am quite confident
    she can do it again; however hard work will be required to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Antoine Shiu, the general manager to whom Ayotte
    reported, testified that he and Ayotte had discussed Piresferreira’s 2004 year-end
    performance appraisal and that he had instructed Ayotte to monitor her
    performance during the first quarter of 2005 and to consider issuing a
    Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) to ensure she developed some concrete
    strategies to meet targets in the future.  <span>  </span>Shiu also testified that he spoke with Ayotte
    in April 2005 about Piresferreira’s continued poor performance and a decision
    was made “to move forward with a PIP”.  He advised Ayotte to consult Bell Mobility’s Human Resources Department
    (HR) before moving forward.  Ayotte
    testified he consulted with HR about how he should proceed with a PIP for
    Piresferreira.  He received a sample PIP
    from HR by email on May 4, 2005.  </p>
  <h2>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Battery of May 12, 2005</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On Thursday, May 12, 2005, Ayotte learned that
    Piresferreira had failed to arrange a meeting with a client.  He arranged the meeting himself on short
    notice by phoning the client.  He yelled
    and swore at Piresferreira while criticizing her for failing to do her
    job.  She attempted to justify her efforts
    to schedule the meeting, asking that he read an email on her Blackberry.  He indicated
    he did not wish to hear her explanation.  Piresferreira followed him, proffering her Blackberry and persisting in
    saying she wanted him to read the email.  He told her to get away from him and when she held up the Blackberry in
    front of him, he pushed her on her left shoulder, repeating that she should get
    away from him. The trial judge found that “[t]he push carried enough force that
    Piresferreira was pushed approximately a foot. Piresferreira took a step
    backward and balanced herself against a filing cabinet.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After he
    pushed Piresferreria, Ayotte went to his office and sat at his desk.    Piresferreira followed Ayotte to his
    office and told him he should not have pushed her. Ayotte told her “to get the
    hell out of his office” and that he was in the process of preparing a PIP
    regarding her performance.  Piresferreira
    went back to her desk and began to cry.  After speaking to colleagues, she collected her things and went
    home.  </p>
  <h2>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aftermath of the Battery</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the incident, Ayotte prepared a PIP for
    Piresferreira and sent it to HR that afternoon.  In his covering email to HR, he expressed concern that she would go on
    sick leave as soon as the PIP was presented.  He asked for HR’s quick approval of the PIP so he could present it to
    Piresferriera the next afternoon “to give the employee the weekend to reflect
    on it.”  He did not mention the
    confrontation with Piresferreira earlier that day or that she was upset because
    he had pushed her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day, Piresferreira sent an email to Ayotte stating
    that “it is certainly not acceptable that you shoved me in the corridor
    yesterday afternoon” and offering “to sit down together outside the office and
    come to an agreement to work as a team”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After some scheduled vacation days, Piresferreira
    returned to the office on May 19, 2005.  Ayotte presented her with the PIP he had prepared on May 12.  It required her to report to him daily on her
    activities and attend bi-weekly individual meetings with him.  It advised her that an overall review of her
    progress would occur on August 12, 2005, and if her performance did not improve
    to a fully acceptable level, further disciplinary action up to and including
    dismissal would result.  Piresferreira
    refused to sign the PIP and went home.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 20, 2005, Piresferreira lodged a formal
    complaint with HR against Ayotte.  Shiu
    spoke to Ayotte, who gave his version of the incident.  He admitted pushing her but claimed he was
    provoked by her persistence in trying to get him to read an email on the
    Blackberry that she was brandishing in his face.  Shiu did not contact Piresferreira to obtain
    her version of the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 24, 2005, HR sent two communications to Piresferreira.  The first, an email sent mid-day, stated in
    part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As discussed on Friday, May 20th, I will
    provide you with a response to your complaint by the end of today.  As well, I have scheduled a meeting between
    you, Rick Ayotte and Antoine Shiu for tomorrow morning May 25th at 9h30 to<b> </b>review the performance improvement
    plan. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Piresferreira sent an email to HR stating that she
    would be on sick leave as of May 25 and would be unable to attend any meeting.  She provided a sick leave certificate from her
    family doctor indicating she was not at work due to “stress leave due to
    anxiety <span style='line-height:200%'>–</span> dealing with work harassment.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though the above letter referred to the purpose of the
    meeting only as a review of the PIP, later in the day, HR sent Piresferreira a
    letter that claimed that she had declined to attend a meeting to allow Ayotte
    to apologize.  That letter read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Re:
    Complaint against Richard Ayotte</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Marta,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This
    is to confirm the reception of your complaint against Richard Ayotte on May
    20th, 2005 concerning an altercation that would have involved yelling and
    pushing.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>After
    reviewing the information you provided to me, I discussed the allegations that
    you put forward with Richard Ayotte. Mr. Ayotte confirmed that he acted
    inappropriately towards you and regretted having pushed you and yelled after
    you.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Considering
    that these were unacceptable behaviours, especially for a manager, the
    following actions have been taken:</span></p>

    to allow Richard Ayotte to offer formal apologies to you, which you have
    declined to attend.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>*  Written</span> disciplinary warning will be given to
    Richard Ayotte for unacceptable behaviour in the workplace.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>We
    have received an official complaint on May 20th, 2005 regarding an altercation

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ayotte attended one session with a counsellor through
    Bell Mobility’s Employee Assistance Program.  He had already completed the two courses mentioned in the May 24 letter
    some time earlier and did not repeat them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Piresferreira never returned to work.  She commenced litigation against Ayotte and
    Bell Mobility on August 11, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 27, 2005, Bell Mobility’s lawyers proposed
    that if Piresferreira returned to work, a representative from HR would meet
    with her and Ayotte in an effort to work through their differences.  As an alternative, Bell Mobility offered to
    implement a system where Piresferreira reported directly to Shiu and not to
    Ayotte.  Piresferreira declined this
    offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 9, 2006, Bell Mobility’s lawyers advised
    Piresferreira that Ayotte had been “relocated within the Bell Family” and, thus,
    she could return to the office without having to work with him.  Piresferreira refused because former
    colleagues informed her that Ayotte still worked out of the Ottawa office in
    the same capacity.  This was confirmed at
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 11, 2006, Bell Mobility advised
    Piresferreira that Ayotte was retiring at the end of the month and again
    proposed that she return to work.  Piresferreira declined again.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 21, 2006, Bell Mobility responded that it considered
    Piresferreira to have resigned effective September 19, 2006.  The matter proceeded to trial.</p>
  <h2>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Piresferreira’s Condition</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Piresferreira began to see a psychologist, Dr. Heney, in
    November 2005.  Dr. Heney, who was still
    treating her at the time of the trial, diagnosed her with posttraumatic stress
    disorder and testified that she was totally disabled from work as a
    result.  In Dr. Heney’s opinion,
    Piresferreira’s symptoms related to the assault and what she perceived as a
    betrayal and injustice on the part of Bell Mobility.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Piresferreira also saw a psychiatrist, Dr. Basson, who
    treated her from July 2006 to September 2007.  Dr. Basson diagnosed her as suffering from major depressive disorder
    with symptoms of anxiety.  In her
    opinion, Piresferreira’s depression and anxiety were triggered by Ayotte’s
    physical assault, followed by his failure to apologize and then Bell Mobility’s
    failure to apologize and take concrete steps to remove Ayotte from a position
    of authority and supervision over Piresferreira.  </p>
  <h1><span>C.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The decision at trial</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected Ayotte’s evidence that he pushed Piresferreira in a
    defensive reaction and that he was provoked by her persistently brandishing the
    Blackberry in his face.  Ayotte had
    committed a battery and was liable for all the damage that resulted even though
    “the injuries arising out of his assault and battery...exceeded all reasonable
    expectations and intended or foreseeable consequences”.  Bell Mobility was vicariously liable for the
    damage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge found that Ayotte had also commited the tort of intentional infliction of
    mental suffering.  The trial judge
    set out the elements of this tort as stated in <i>Prinzo v. Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d)
    474 (C.A.):  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(1) <span class=GramE>flagrant</span> or outrageous conduct; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(2) <span class=GramE>calculated</span> to produce harm; and </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(3) <span class=GramE>resulting</span> in a
    visible and provable illness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    found that Ayotte’s threat of placing Piresferreira on probation or on a PIP
    immediately after he had assaulted her and then delivering a PIP to her the first
    time she returned to the office <span style='line-height:200%'>–</span> without
    first having assumed responsibility for his abusive behaviour <span
style='line-height:200%'>–</span> was flagrant and outrageous conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge predicated her conclusion that the
    second element was established, not on intention or knowledge that harm was
    substantially certain to follow, but on a finding that “Ayotte showed reckless
    disregard for Piresferreira’s emotional well-being”.  In her view, Ayotte’s conduct was “calculated
    to produce harm” even though he did not actually intend that <span
class=SpellE>Piresferriera</span> suffer the injury that she did.     <span> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial
    judge found that the third element was satisfied because Ayotte’s conduct
    caused or materially contributed to Piresferreira developing posttraumatic
    stress disorder and a major depressive disorder with anxiety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held Bell Mobility vicariously liable for both the above torts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    the trial judge found Ayotte and Bell Mobility both liable for the tort she
    described as “Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, Mental
    Suffering, Nervous Shock and/or Psycho-traumatic Disability”.  She found that Bell Mobility as Piresferreira’s
    employer and Ayotte as her immediate supervisor owed Piresferreira a duty of
    care to ensure that Piresferreira was working in a safe and harassment-free environment
    without verbal abuse, intimidation or physical assault, all in accordance with
    Bell Mobility’s Code of Business Conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She found that Ayotte breached this duty of care
    by yelling and swearing at Piresferreira particularly during 2004 and 2005, and
    including on May 12, 2005 when he berated her in front of other employees,
    physically assaulted her and added insult to injury by, without apologizing,
    issuing a PIP.  She found that his
    conduct did not conform “<span class=GramE>with</span> Bell Mobility’s
    expectations as set out in its Code of Business Conduct” and added that “[i]t
    was reasonably foreseeable to Ayotte that every aspect of this behaviour was
    likely to cause Piresferreira anxiety, stress and emotional upset.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition
    to its vicarious liability for Ayotte’s breach of his duty of care, the trial
    judge found that Bell Mobility, itself, breached its duty of care.  The basis of that finding was that after Ayotte
    admitted he had yelled at and pushed Piresferreira, neither HR nor Shiu
    contacted Piresferreira to express Bell Mobility’s concern as to how she had
    been treated, to apologize on Bell Mobility’s behalf, and to see how she was
    doing.  Instead, Bell Mobility’s
    communications conveyed to Piresferreira that its priority was the PIP <span
style='line-height:200%'>–</span> not Ayotte’s behaviour.  The disciplinary measures that Bell Mobility
    told Piresferreira it would impose on Ayotte were inappropriately mild and
    ignored Ayotte’s failure to apologize to Piresferreira, his use of a PIP to
    intimidate her, his failure to report the assault and the immediate imposition
    of a PIP.  Moreover, no one from Bell
    Mobility contacted Piresferreira to get her input on what steps could be taken
    to ensure that she would feel physically and emotionally safe at her workplace
    in the future. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that Piresferreira suffered damage from the appellants’
    breach of their duty of care, and her damages were not too remote to be
    recoverable.  Moreover, in light of
    Ayotte’s personal knowledge of Piresferreira, it was foreseeable to him that
    his conduct would cause her serious psychological injury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    the trial judge found the tort was made out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    regard to remedy, the trial judge found that the damages for battery and
    intentional infliction of mental suffering were not limited by what harm was
    foreseeable.  She assessed Piresferreira’s damages for the three torts of battery
    and intentional and negligent infliction of mental suffering all together.  She assessed Piresferreira’s general damages
    at $50,000 and calculated her loss of
    income to retirement at age 65 at $500,924.  She made no reduction for the long-term disability benefits
    Piresferreira received but reduced the assessed damages by 10% for the
    contingencies of life.  The contingencies
    she discussed were that Piresferreira may not have worked until retirement and
    may have suffered anxiety given the death of close friends, other medical
    problems and the fact that her partner had been seriously injured that year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also awarded Piresferreira special damages of $5,122, and awarded her
    partner $15,000 for the loss of guidance, care and companionship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge then turned to Piresferreira’s claim for wrongful dismissal.  She found that Piresferreira had been
    constructively dismissed on May 24, 2005 since by that date her continued
    employment at Bell Mobility had become impossible.  She assessed Piresferreira’s wage loss at $87,855
    based on a twelve month notice period and her damages for mental distress from
    the manner of dismissal at $45,000, but did not award these amounts as Piresferreira
    was already compensated for them through the tort damages.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge ordered Bell Mobility to pay Piresferreira costs in the amount of
    $225,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST, and made Ayotte jointly and
    severally liable for the sum of $200,000.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise the following issues:</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in finding that the tort of
    negligent infliction of mental suffering was available in the context of the
    employment relationship?</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in finding Ayotte committed the
    tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering?</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in her award of damages for
    assault and battery?</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in finding that Piresferreira
    did not fail to mitigate her damages for constructive dismissal?</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can the trial judge’s award of damages under the <i>Family Law Act</i> stand?</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the trial judge found that Ayotte and Bell
    Mobility were jointly and severally liable for the torts of battery,
    intentional infliction of mental suffering, and negligent infliction of mental
    suffering, she assessed “Piresferreira’s damages arising from her tort claims” globally.  Since I conclude that the tort of negligent
    infliction of mental suffering is not available in this case and the tort of
    intentional infliction of mental suffering was not made out on the evidence, the
    damages awarded must rest on the tort of battery alone.  For that reason, I leave consideration of the
    battery issue until after dealing with the other two torts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin by explaining why the tort of negligence is not
    available and then why the tort of intentional infliction of emotional
    suffering was not made out.  Then, after
    dealing with the trial judge’s damages award for battery, I turn to
    Piresferreira’s entitlement to damages for mental distress at employment law,
    the issue of mitigation, and the costs award at trial.</p>
  <h2>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Negligent Infliction of Mental Suffering</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ main submission is that the trial judge erred by recognizing the
    existence of this tort in employment relationships.  At trial, the appellants did not advance this
    argument.  I would entertain the argument
    nevertheless.  An appellate court has the
    inherent authority to permit an argument to be made that was not raised in the
    proceedings below and should do so when the issue is one of pure law, no
    further evidence is necessary and there is no prejudice in the form of
    detrimental reliance: see <i>Athey v.
    Leonati</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458.  Here,
    the argument raises a pure question of law of broad importance in employment
    law.  Had the appellants contested the
    existence of the tort at trial, it would have had no effect on the presentation
    of Piresferreira’s evidence and its only impact would have been on the legal arguments
    advanced in closing.  The respondent did
    not object to the issue being raised before this court and responded to it in
    her factum. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge termed the tort she recognized
    “Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, Mental Suffering, Nervous Shock
    and/or Psycho-traumatic Disability”.  She found that the duty of care for the tort
    rested squarely on the contractual relationship between the parties.  Under the heading, “Did Ayotte/Bell Mobility
    owe Piresferreira a duty of care?”, she said that Bell Mobility “as
    Piresferreira’s employer” and Ayotte “as her immediate supervisor” owed her
    “the duty to ensure that [she] was working in a safe and harassment-free
    environment…<u>all in accordance with Bell Mobility’s Code of Business Conduct</u>”
    (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Piresferreira defended this finding by stressing that the Code of Business
    Conduct formed part of the employment contract.  Employees had to sign it every year as part of their annual performance
    appraisal.  The Code of Business Conduct,
    he argued, made it clear that the employer had the duty to ensure that employees
    did not suffer mental suffering.  Counsel
    pointed out that the Code of Business Conduct guaranteed employees the “right to
    work in an environment free from violence and threats” and prohibited “all acts
    of physical, verbal or written aggression or violence”.  He submitted that the duty of care recognized
    by the trial judge flowed from the Code of Business Conduct, and that the
    conduct of the employer constituted “a fundamental breach of the terms and
    conditions of employment”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accepting
    that Bell Mobility’s Code of Business Conduct was part of the employment
    contract, a breach of a contractual duty cannot be the basis for the
    recognition of a common law tort.  <span
style='color:black'>For </span>concurrent tort liability to be available there
    must be a common law duty of care that would exist even in the absence of the
    specific contractual term which created the corresponding contractual
    obligation.  In <i>Central &amp; Eastern Trust Co. v. Rafuse</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147, Le
    Dain J. differentiated between a duty that is created by the contract and an
    independent common law duty.  He wrote at
    p. 205:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>What is undertaken
    by the contract will indicate the nature of the relationship that gives rise to
    the common law duty of care, but the nature and scope of the duty of care that
    is asserted as the foundation of the tortious liability must not depend on
    specific obligations or duties created by the express terms of the contract. It
    is in that sense that the common law duty of care must be independent of the
    contract.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    meaning of this passage was clarified by the majority of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>BG Checo International Ltd. v.
    British Columbia Hydro &amp; Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12, at p. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In our view, Le Dain J.’s use of the words
    “created” and “depends” indicates the meaning of this passage is simply that
    for concurrent tort liability to be available there must be a duty of care in
    tort that would exist even in the absence of the specific contractual term
    which created the corresponding contractual obligation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge rested her finding that
    Piresferreira had established the tort of negligent infliction of mental
    suffering on Bell Mobility’s failure to treat her “in accordance with Bell
    Mobility’s Code of Business Conduct.”  After
    itemizing Ayotte’s acts on which her finding was based, she wrote, “None
    conformed <span class=GramE>with</span> Bell Mobility’s expectations as set out
    in its Code of Business Conduct.”  The
    trial judge erred in basing the
    standard of care on a contractual obligation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could the trial judge have rested her conclusion on a
    tort duty of care?  Since no Canadian
    appellate court has recognized a free standing cause of action in tort against
    an employer for negligent infliction of mental suffering by an employee, it is necessary
    to apply the <i>Anns</i> test.  The two-part test from <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>, [1978] A.C. 728</span> (H.L.) for determining whether a duty of
    care arises as adopted and recast by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Nielsen v. Kamloops (City)</i>, [1984] 2
    S.C.R. 2, at pp. 10-11, involves asking first whether the relationship between
    the plaintiff and the defendant is sufficiently close or “proximate” to render
    damages reasonably foreseeable and justify the imposition of a duty of care,
    and second, whether there are countervailing policy considerations why a duty
    of care should be limited or not recognized: see <i>Childs v. <span class=SpellE>Desormeaux</span></i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R.
    643, at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship of employer and employee puts the
    parties in a relationship of proximity.  As
    Le Dain J. explained in <i>Rafuse</i>, a relationship
    of proximity that would not have arisen but for a contract can support the
    creation of a common law duty of care. The question is whether there is a
    relationship of sufficient proximity, not how that relationship arose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the damage was foreseeable.  She noted as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it is reasonably foreseeable that
    a person of ordinary fortitude would suffer serious psychological injury if
    that person was regularly yelled and sworn at by her manager/supervisor/boss,
    was told by the manager/supervisor/boss that she did not know what she was
    doing, was not given the opportunity to explain her actions or defend herself,
    was pushed by the manager/supervisor/boss who at the time was clearly angry and
    out of control, and was immediately told that she would be put on probation or
    issued a PIP.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that this foreseeability finding is
    incompatible with the Supreme Court’s judgment in <i>Honda</i>.  In <i>Honda,</i> the Supreme Court reiterated the
    general rule that damages in a wrongful dismissal action are confined to the
    loss suffered from the employer’s failure to give proper notice and that no
    damages are available for the mental suffering the employee may have suffered
    unless the parties contemplated at the time of the employment contract that a
    breach of the contract might cause the plaintiff mental distress.  The proposition that mental suffering is
    generally not within the contemplation of the parties to an employment contract
    does not mean, as the Supreme Court makes clear, that it is not contemplated by
    the parties to a particular employment contract.  As well, the principle enunciated in <i>Honda </i>is directed to mental suffering as
    a consequence of the manner of termination, as opposed to mental suffering <span
class=GramE>that results</span> from mistreatment during the employment
    relationship.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no reason to resist the finding of the trial
    judge that it was reasonably foreseeable that Piresferreira would experience
    mental suffering from the abusive manner in which Ayotte supervised her during
    her employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the parties had a relationship of proximity
    and that the damages suffered were reasonably foreseeable, it must be
    determined whether policy considerations foreclose the recognition of a duty of
    care.  In my view, they do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Supreme Court has already strongly intimated
    that the recognition of such a tort in the employment context is better left to
    the legislature.  In <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd</i>., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701,
    Iacobucci J. writing for the majority rejected the notion that a tort existed for
    breach of a good faith and fair dealing obligation by employers in dismissing
    employees.  He wrote at para. 77, “To
    create such a tort in this case would therefore constitute a radical shift in
    the law, again a step better left to be taken by the legislatures.”  The further evolution of the law in <i>Honda </i>is completely consistent with this
    view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The duty rejected in <i>Wallace</i> is not exactly the same duty postulated in this case.  This, however, provides more, not less,
    reason to reject a duty in this case.  The
    duty of care put forward in this case is broader than the duty that was
    rejected in <i>Wallace</i>.  A general duty to take care to shield an
    employee during the entire course of his or her employment from acts in the
    workplace that might cause mental suffering strikes me as far more expansive
    than a duty to act fairly and in good faith during just the termination
    process.  The duty rejected in <i>Wallace</i> would have applied only at the
    time of termination and to the manner of termination.  The duty put forward in this case would apply
    in the course of employment as well as to its termination.  The general duty postulated would require
    employers to take care to shield employees from the acts of other employees
    that might cause mental suffering.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this sense, the asserted duty of care would have a
    far greater impact on settled jurisprudence than would the duty of good faith and
    fair dealing that Iacobucci J. described in <i>Wallace</i> at para. 76 as “overly intrusive and inconsistent with established principles
    of employment law”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The findings of the trial judge in this case provide an
    apt example.  The trial judge assessed
    Piresferreira’s damages for wrongful dismissal as comprised of her salary and
    benefits for 12 months from May 24, 2005 and an additional $45,000 for mental
    distress under the framework established by <i>Honda</i>.  By contrast, the tort damages awarded by the
    trial judge included lost income between May 24, 2005 and July 2009, less a 10%
    discount for contingencies.  In <i>BG Checo</i>, the Supreme Court noted at p.
    38 that “it would seem anomalous to award a different level of damages for what
    is essentially the same wrong on the sole basis of the form of action chosen,
    though, of course, particular circumstances or policy may dictate such a
    course.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No particular circumstances or policy that would support
    different scales of damages for mental suffering in tort and contract in the
    employment context were brought to the court’s attention.  Rather, there are good reasons for avoiding
    such a scenario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a case in which the employer’s allegedly tortious
    behaviour includes the termination of the employee, compensation for mental
    distress is available under the framework the Supreme Court has set out in <i>Honda</i>.  In a case in which the employer does not
    terminate the employee, the employee who is caused mental distress by the
    employer’s abusive conduct can claim constructive dismissal and still have
    recourse to damages under the <i>Honda </i>framework.  Recognizing the tort in the employment
    relationship would overtake and supplant that framework and all of the
    employment law jurisprudence from which it evolved.  In other words, in the dismissal context, the
    law already provides a remedy in respect of the loss complained of here.  The recognition of the tort is not necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That leaves the category of cases in which the employee
    suffers mental distress from employer conduct that would not provide the
    grounds for a claim of constructive dismissal.  Perhaps it can be said, as the respondents submit, that it is not
    foreseeable that an employee would suffer mental distress from criticism of poor
    work performance that is constructive.  However, much disagreement can be anticipated as to whether criticism is
    “constructive”, whether work performance is “poor”, and whether the tone of the
    former was appropriate to the latter.  The existence of the tort would require the resolution of such
    disputes.  The court is often called upon
    to review the work performance of employees and the content and manner of their
    supervision in dismissal cases.  It is
    unnecessary and undesirable to expand the court’s involvement in such
    questions.  It is unnecessary because if
    the employees are sufficiently aggrieved, they can claim constructive
    dismissal.  It is undesirable because it
    would be a considerable intrusion by the courts into the workplace, it has a
    real potential to constrain efforts to achieve increased efficiencies, and the
    postulated duty of care is so general and broad it could apply indeterminately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would set aside the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellants were liable to the respondents for committing the tort of negligent
    infliction of mental suffering as the tort is not available in the employment
    context.  Employees, of course, can sue
    their employers or supervisors for the intentional infliction of mental
    suffering.  I now turn to the trial
    judge’s finding that the appellants were liable for that tort.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in
    finding that there was “flagrant and outrageous conduct” and in finding that
    “reckless disregard” met the requirement that their conduct was “calculated to
    produce harm”.  Before proceeding to
    appraise the trial judge’s analysis, it is important to note that she found
    that Ayotte committed this tort but was not persuaded that Bell Mobility had in
    its own right.  She stated that she did
    not “consider Bell Mobility’s conduct flagrant or outrageous, nor…that it was
    calculated to produce harm.”  However, in
    her view, Bell Mobility was vicariously liable for the tort committed by
    Ayotte.  Therefore, only Ayotte’s conduct
    is pertinent to the analysis.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that, viewed in context, Ayotte’s
    act of placing Piresferreira on a PIP after the assault does not satisfy the
    tort’s requirement for “flagrant and outrageous” conduct.  They submit that the trial judge’s failure to
    take into account significant evidence in her analysis led her to rationalize <span
class=SpellE>Piresferreira’s</span> poor performance in 2005 and understate Ayotte’s
    prior intention to place her on a PIP.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge emphasized that Ayotte, “aside from the
    chronic annual observations”, had not kept a written record of Piresferreira’s
    shortcomings in the spring of 2005.  She
    noted that there was no documentary evidence to corroborate the evidence of Ayotte
    and Shiu that, “early in 2005, Ayotte told Shiu about significant deficiencies
    on Piresferreira’s part and Shiu instructed Ayotte to issue a PIP.”  She also noted that neither <span
class=SpellE>Ayotte’s</span> email to <span class=GramE>HR indicating</span> his intention to place an employee on a PIP nor the May 4 response from HR
    providing Ayotte with a sample PIP mentioned Piresferreira by name. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that, as the trial judge did not
    make any adverse finding about <span class=SpellE>Shiu’s</span> credibility, she
    had no basis to disregard his testimony that in April 2005 Ayotte did report to
    him that Piresferreira continued to perform poorly after her 2004 performance
    review and that he advised Ayotte to issue the PIP after consulting with HR.  The appellants say there was no evidence that
    the sample PIP provided by HR related to an employee other than Piresferreira.  The sample PIP should have been seen as
    corroboration of <span class=SpellE>Shiu’s</span> and Ayotte’s testimony.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the evidence establishes that
    Shiu and Ayotte had discussed the PIP process on two occasions in the months before
    the incident on May 12, that <span class=SpellE>Shiu</span> had specifically
    authorized the issuance of a PIP, and that Ayotte was already preparing to
    present the PIP to Piresferreira when she failed to arrange the meeting with
    the client on May 12.  In this context,
    they submit, though there is no excuse for Ayotte losing his temper and pushing
    Piresferreira, his immediate angry announcement that he was placing her on a
    PIP and his subsequent issuance of a PIP cannot reasonably be described as
    “flagrant or outrageous” for the purpose of this tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge did not indicate any basis for expressing
    scepticism about this evidence, what she found significant was the timing and
    context of the presentation of the PIP, not the presentation itself.  What she found flagrant and outrageous was
    Ayotte’s threat to issue a PIP immediately after the assault, then delivering the
    PIP immediately on <span class=SpellE>Piresferreira’s</span> return to work “without
    first having assumed responsibility for his abusive behaviour”.  This finding largely undermines the appellants’
    complaints about the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence.  It seems to me that the trial judge
    implicitly accepted that a PIP was eventually going to be issued to
    Piresferreira.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the behaviour the trial judge described is
    far removed from the sort of glaring and notorious false communication that has
    been the basis of the classic application of the tort.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Rather, the behaviour spans seven days and largely
    rests on an omission rather than an act.  The clear implication is that the presentation of the PIP would not have
    been “flagrant and outrageous” had Ayotte apologized before presenting it to
    Piresferreira.  Though I recognize that
    the ambit of what the case law considers “flagrant and outrageous” is expanding
    as this tort evolves, I harbour considerable unease with the weight the trial
    judge placed on <span class=SpellE>Ayotte’s</span> failure to apologize in
    concluding that his conduct was “flagrant and outrageous” in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it is
    not necessary to resolve my unease, as I have no hesitation in finding that the
    trial judge erred in law by concluding that the second element of this
    tort – the requirement that the conduct be calculated to produce harm – was
    established.  </p>

    the test for the second element of this tort as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[F]or the conduct to be calculated to produce
    harm, either the actor must desire to produce the consequences that follow, or

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge recognized this test, but then applied
    a different one.  Her reasons make plain
    that she did not find that Ayotte either desired to produce the consequences
    that followed or that he knew they were substantially certain to follow.  Instead she found “that Ayotte showed reckless
    disregard for Piresferreira’s emotional well-being”.  In making this finding she relied on<i> Rahemtulla v. <span class=SpellE>Vanfed</span> Credit Union</i> (1984), 51 B.C.L.R. 200 (S.C.).<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though this court in <i>Prinzo</i> considered <i>Rahemtulla </i>in
    the course of its review of the caselaw and commentary, it did not include
    “reckless disregard” in its statement of what was required to establish the
    second element.  This court referred to <i>Rahemtulla</i> again in <i>Correia v. Canac Kitchens</i> (2008), 91 O.R. (3d) 353.  After quoting the comments in <i>Rahemtulla</i> about “reckless disregard”, Rosenberg
    and Feldman JJ.A., writing for the court, noted at para. 85 that this court in <i>Prinzo</i> had “used similar language noting
    that this element is made out ‘if the consequences are known to be
    substantially certain to follow’”.  It
    seems then that <span class=SpellE><i>Correia</i></span> viewed the “reckless disregard” standard applied in <i>Rahemtulla</i> as merely the articulation of the standard stated in <i>Prinzo</i> in different language.  <span class=SpellE><i>Correia</i></span> did not relax the standard stated in <i>Prinzo</i>, but reaffirmed it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> “Recklessness”
    is a flexible term capable of different meanings in different contexts.  As I read it, <span class=SpellE><i>Correia</i></span> indicates that in the context
    of the employment relationship, recklessness should be understood as proceeding
    in the face of subjective awareness that harm of the kind that resulted was
    substantially certain to follow.  An
    objective approach to recklessness that considers whether a reasonable person
    would know that the harm was foreseeable or likely to result seems more
    consonant with negligence than with an intentional tort.  Intentional torts provide remedies for
    advertent behaviour, rather than inadvertent behaviour.  The law treats intentional torts more
    severely, for example by not limiting the scope of damages in the same way as in
    a negligence case.  The test stated in <i>Prinzo</i> and reaffirmed in <span
class=SpellE><i>Correia</i></span> maintains
    the distinction between intentional torts and negligence.  As noted <span class=SpellE>Weiler</span> J.A. said in <span class=SpellE><i>Prinzo</i></span> <span style='line-height:200%'>that the “consequences <u>must be known by the actor</u> to be substantially certain to follow”
    (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have already rejected the recognition of the tort of
    negligent infliction of mental suffering in an employment relationship.  Accepting an objective sense of
    “recklessness” dependent on whether the harm ultimately suffered was
    foreseeable or likely to result should be rejected for the same reasons.  Essentially, permitting liability on such a reduced
    standard would unduly interfere with the settled principles of employment law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge did not explain what
    meaning she attached to “recklessness” in finding that Ayotte acted in “reckless
    disregard for Piresferreira’s emotional well-being”.  It is apparent, however, that she did not consider
    “reckless disregard” as merely expressing the standard in <span class=SpellE><i>Prinzo</i></span> and <span class=SpellE><i>Correia</i></span> in different language.  Rather, she had a lower standard in mind.  She explained that she was satisfied that
    Ayotte’s conduct was calculated to produce harm “even though he did not
    actually intend for her to suffer the injury she did.”  Elsewhere in her reasons, she said it was
    “reasonably foreseeable” to Ayotte that his behaviour “was likely to cause
    Piresferreira anxiety, stress and emotional upset”.  She erred by finding that the second element
    of this tort was established by something less than the standard stated in <span
class=SpellE><i>Prinzo</i></span> and <span
class=SpellE><i>Correia</i></span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion that the second element of
    the tort was made out must be set aside for an additional reason.  In establishing the tort it must be shown that the defendant desired to
    produce the <i>kind</i> of harm that was suffered or knew that
    it was substantially certain to follow.  In
    the seminal case of <i>Wilkinson v. <span class=SpellE>Downton</span></i>,
    the court further noted at p. 59 that the defendant’s conduct must be “plainly calculated to produce some
    effect <u>of the kind</u> which was produced” (emphasis added).  It is clear, as the trial judge observed,
    that where the tort is established, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the
    full extent of the damages suffered even if they could not have been
    anticipated.  As indicated in <i>Wilkinson v. Downton</i>, “it is no answer in law to say that more
    harm was done than was anticipated, for that is commonly the case with all
    wrongs.”  The <i>extent</i> of the harm need not be anticipated, but the <i>kind</i> of harm must have been intended or
    known to be substantially certain to follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge found that Ayotte showed reckless
    disregard “for Piresferreira’s emotional well-being”.  She did not consider and the evidence does
    not support the inference that Ayotte intended or knew it was substantially
    certain to follow that Piresferreira would suffer posttraumatic stress disorder
    as diagnosed by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Heney</span> or a major depressive
    disorder as diagnosed by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Basson</span>, with the result that
    she would never be able to work in any employment again and that her personal
    life would be changed so dramatically.  At
    most, the trial judge found, at para. 190, that serious psychological injury
    was foreseeable to Ayotte.  <span
class=SpellE>Foreseeability</span>, which indicates only that a result may
    follow, is much less than knowledge that a result is substantially certain to
    follow.  I agree with the remarks of M.E.
    Boyd J. in <span class=SpellE><i>Kedia</i></span><i> International Inc. v. Royal Bank of Canada</i>,
    2008 BCSC 122, at para. 196, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the defence
    submission that it makes no sense to deem intention on the basis of simple <span
class=SpellE>foreseeability</span>, while at the same time denying the

    be very high.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge erred in finding that the second

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants concede that Ayotte committed an inexcusable
    battery on Piresferreira.  They do,
    however, contest the trial judge’s assessment of damages for the battery.  They submit that she included damages due to
    factors other than the assault and battery.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The analysis is hampered by the fact that the
    trial judge did not separately assess the damages for battery.  As noted earlier, she assessed and awarded “damages
    arising from [Piresferreira’s] tort claims”.  However, in her earlier discussion of each
    tort the trial judge set out her approach to the damages that arose from
    each.  In considering what damages flowed
    from the battery, the trial judge reasoned that the battery “started a chain of
    events” that “collectively resulted in the deterioration of Piresferreira’s
    emotional health and resulted in her disability”.  She held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Included
    in that chain of events was Ayotte’s failure to apologize for the assault, Bell
    Mobility’s failure to apologize for the assault, Ayotte’s immediate and
    inappropriate imposition of a PIP and Bell Mobility’s collaboration in this
    regard, Bell Mobility's failure to adequately investigate the incidents of May
    12, 2005, Bell Mobility’s failure to adequately address the risk to
    Piresferreira of her continuing under Ayotte’s supervision, Bell Mobility’s
    failure to adequately discipline Ayotte for the assault, Bell Mobility’s
    on-going expectation for Piresferreira to return to the same work environment
    without meaningful steps being taken to ensure a “safe” environment for her,
    and Bell Mobility’s meritless allegation that Piresferreira orchestrated the
    constructive dismissal scenario because she could not accept that her
    performance at work was below standard.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to discern what, other than chronology,
    links these acts into one chain.  Most of
    the acts included are those of Bell Mobility and not those of Ayotte.  The relationship between the acts is not
    causal.  Ayotte’s battery did not cause the
    next event in the chain as does the first vehicle <span style='line-height:200%'>in a highway pileup where each vehicle is struck and
    forced forward to collide with the next.  </span>After the assault, Bell Mobility might have acted differently than
    the way the trial judge found, in part, “collectively” resulted in the
    damages.  Bell Mobility might have taken
    all of the steps that the trial judge considered necessary.  It might have apologized for the assault, it
    might have disavowed the imposition of the PIP, it might have adequately
    investigated the incident of May 12, 2005, it might have adequately addressed
    the risk to Piresferreira of her continuing under Ayotte’s supervision, it
    might have adequately disciplined Ayotte, it might have ensured a “safe”
    environment for Piresferreira, and it might have refrained from making a meritless
    allegation that Piresferreira orchestrated the constructive dismissal scenario
    because she could not accept that her performance was below standard.  If Bell Mobility had done these things
    differently, the damages that resulted from the battery would have also been
    different.  In other words, the acts and
    omissions of Bell Mobility relied on by the trial judge were neither the
    necessary nor the inevitable result of the battery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her negligence analysis, the trial judge dealt with
    Bell Mobility’s failures as independent ones for which Bell Mobility <span
class=GramE>itself</span> was responsible.  As well, the trial judge’s damages analysis included acts that flowed
    from acts done before the assault.  It is
    clear from a reading of her <span style='line-height:
200%'>reasons as a whole </span>that the trial judge considered that
    Piresferreira’s psychological disabilities and her inability to work in any
    employment were largely caused by matters other than the battery itself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it may be, as the trial judge observed, that
    damages for battery are not limited to what the defendant intended or foresaw,
    it is still necessary that the damage be caused by the battery.  The trial judge’s conclusion that all the
    damages were caused by the battery because the damages collectively resulted
    from the battery and other acts is both unreasonable and inconsistent with her
    other findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the findings of the trial judge, Piresferreira
    suffered no physical injury, psychological harm or other ill effect from the push
    itself.  In fact, after the battery,
    Piresferreira was still willing to “come to an agreement to work as a team”
    with Ayotte. The trial judge described in detail the course of Piresferreira’s
    deterioration with her perception of the unfairness of subsequent events and
    the failure of Bell Mobility to provide her with a safe working environment.  The subsequent events did not inevitably
    follow from the battery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The damages awards for battery absent actual injury that
    were considered by the trial judge ranged from $400 to $11,000.  Taking into consideration the context in which
    it occurred, I would assess Piresferreira’s damages from the battery generously
    at $15,000.</p>
  <h2>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Damages for Wrongful Dismissal</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Piresferreira was
    constructively dismissed on May 24, 2005 and assessed damages based on a 12-month
    period of notice.  Bell Mobility does not
    appeal those findings but argues that the trial judge erred by refusing to
    address Piresferreira’s failure to mitigate her damages and by finding that an
    award of $45,000 for the manner of dismissal was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to the argument regarding
    Piresferreira’s failure to mitigate her lost wages because the trial judge, as
    she was entitled to do, accepted the evidence that Piresferreira was incapable
    of working in any other employment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Bell Mobility
    contested the trial judge’s finding of bad faith, arguing that her criticism of
    its handling of Piresferreira’s complaint was too exacting.   Piresferreira filed her complaint against
    Ayotte on Friday, May 20, 2005.  Bell
    Mobility points out that it reacted quickly, providing Ayotte with a
    disciplinary letter on May 25, 2005 after a long weekend.  The letter confirmed that Ayotte had yelled
    and pushed Piresferreira, stated uncategorically that such behaviours were
    totally unacceptable and would not be tolerated, asked Ayotte to apologize to
    Piresferreira, placed a disciplinary warning in his file, and warned him that a
    repetition could result in his dismissal.  Bell Mobility, as the letter shows, did not accept Ayotte’s rationalization
    that Piresferreira had provoked him into yelling at her and pushing her.  The letter was unequivocal in condemning his
    conduct.  Bell Mobility argues that it acted
    on Piresferreira’s account of the event in her complaint, and as it was an open
    and shut case, did not need to interview her again to “learn her version”.  Piresferreira’s position that she would not
    return to work unless Ayotte was fired was unreasonable.  This was the first complaint about Ayotte’s conduct
    Bell Mobility had received in his eight years of employment.  The battery could not preclude Bell Mobility
    from exercising proper supervision over Piresferreira.  Here Bell Mobility had an ample basis to
    believe Piresferreira was performing poorly.  The trial judge should have confined herself
    to assessing the employer’s reasonable and good faith view of Piresferreira’s
    performance instead of measuring Piresferreira’s performance herself, which she
    did by rationalizing Piresferreira’s poor performance in 2004 and the spring of
    2005, including her failure to persuade the client to attend the meeting on May
    12.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the merit of these arguments, there was a
    clear evidentiary foundation for the trial judge’s finding of Bell Mobility’s bad
    faith in the constructive dismissal of Piresferreira.  Piresferreira was assaulted by her
    supervisor.  The trial judge found that
    Ayotte deliberately timed his delivery of the PIP to Piresferreira on May 19 to
    ward off the possibility of a complaint by her, that HR emailed Piresferreira
    on May 24 advising that a meeting had been scheduled “to review the Performance
    Improvement Plan” and, when she declined to attend, wrote her claiming that she
    had declined to attend a meeting that had been scheduled to allow Ayotte to
    apologize to her.  Bell Mobility did not
    provide Piresferreira with a copy of the disciplinary warning issued to Ayotte
    or advise her specifically of its contents, and did not take adequate action to
    ensure that she could feel safe in returning to work.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s assessment of Piresferreira’s damages
    of $45,000 for mental suffering from the manner of her dismissal has a solid
    foundation.  After assessing these
    damages, the trial judge did not award them as they would duplicate the tort
    damages she awarded.  I would give effect
    to her assessment and award these damages. </p>
  <h2>5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Damages for Loss of Guidance, Care and Companionship</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given my conclusions above, the trial judge’s damages
    for loss of guidance, care and companionship awarded to Piresferreira’s
    long-term partner must be set aside.  The
    right of dependents to sue in tort for loss of guidance, care and companionship
    under s. 61(2)(e) of the <i>Family Law Act </i>is
    purely derivative and dependent on Piresferreira’s entitlement to damages after
    being injured by the fault or neglect of another.<b>  </b><a name="P1079_112222"></a><a
name=s61s1></a><a name=BK80></a>For the reasons I have set out, Piresferreira
    has no entitlement to damages for negligent or intentional infliction of mental
    suffering and, on the trial judge’s findings, she suffered no actual damage from
    the battery itself.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I w<span lang=EN-US>ould allow the appeal in part.  In
    my view, the tort of negligent infliction of mental suffering is not available
    against an employer and supervisor for conduct in the course of employment.  Further, I conclude that the trial judge
    erred in finding that the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering
    was made out on this record and in her assessment of damages for the assault
    and battery.  However, I would reject the
    appellants’ submission that the respondent failed to mitigate her damages.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would award the respondent </span>$15,000 in damages for the battery, for which
    Bell Mobility and Ayotte are jointly and severally liable.  In addition, I would uphold the trial judge’s
    award of damages for constructive dismissal and hold that Bell Mobility is
    liable for an additional $45,000 for mental suffering due to the manner of Piresferreira’s
    dismissal.  The trial judge’s other
    damages awards, including under the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, are set aside.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have been largely successful on
