  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is in the business of factoring accounts
    receivable. It attempted to register its assignment of accounts agreement with
    the debtor under the <i>Personal Property
    Security Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 (the “<i>PPSA</i>”), but spelled the debtor’s name incorrectly. The respondent
    bank later lent money to the same debtor, registering its general security
    agreement against the debtor’s correct name. The debtor went bankrupt and a
    priority dispute arose. The appellant appeals from the order of the application
    judge, which held that the appellant’s security interest was unperfected and
    that the bank’s perfected <span class=GramE>security</span> took priority over
    the appellant’s unperfected interest in the accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, Fairbanx Corp. entered into an agreement
    entitled “Purchase of Accounts Receivable Agreement” with Friction Tecnology
    Consultants Inc. (the “<span lang=EN-US>debtor”),
    a supplier </span>of plastic injection moulding. The correct spelling of the
    debtor’s name is “Friction Tecnology Consultants Inc.”, spelling “tec[h]nology”
    without the “h”.  However, the debtor
    carried on its business using an incorrect spelling of its name: “Friction Tec<i>h</i>nology Consultants Inc.” (Emphasis
    added). It used this incorrect spelling to enter the agreement with Fairbanx
    and spelled its name that way on its letterhead and invoices. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairbanx registered a financing statement under the <i>PPSA</i> against the debtor, spelling its
    name incorrectly with the “h”. On an ongoing basis, Fairbanx purchased specific
    accounts receivable from the debtor, paid a discounted amount for each account,
    received an assignment of the account, gave notice of the assignment to the
    party that owed the account, and proceeded to collect or attempt to collect and
    retain the monies owed on each such account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 2007, the debtor approached the bank for a
    loan. At that time, the bank conducted a <i>PPSA</i> search under the incorrect spelling of the debtor’s name and found Fairbanx’s
    registration. In January 2008, the bank agreed to proceed with the loan to the
    debtor and instructed its secured transactions personnel operating through its
    head office to conduct the appropriate searches in order to allow the bank to
    obtain a first charge against the debtor under the <i>PPSA</i>. The bank searched under the correctly spelled name of the
    debtor. The search disclosed three creditors but not Fairbanx. Before advancing
    any funds, the bank obtained postponement agreements from the three registered
    creditors and, on January 22, 2008, it advanced a revolving demand facility to
    the debtor. The bank registered its financing statement as a first charge under
    the <i>PPSA</i>, using the proper spelling
    of the debtor’s name without the “h”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the bank had prior knowledge of the debtor’s
    relationship with Fairbanx, as a condition of its loan, the bank required the
    debtor to cease factoring its accounts receivable with Fairbanx. There is no
    evidence on the record that the factoring actually ceased. In fact, the two
    accounts in issue in this application were factored after the date of the
    bank’s agreement and before the debtor’s bankruptcy on March 31, 2009.</p>
  <h3>Issues</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairbanx raises two issues on the appeal, both of which
    were argued before the application judge: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the factoring agreement an absolute assignment of
    accounts that is not subject to the <i>PPSA</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is Fairbanx’s registration under the incorrectly
    spelled name of the debtor nevertheless valid under s. 46(4) of the <i>PPSA</i>, thereby standing in priority to
    the bank’s security?</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h3>Issue 1: Is the factoring agreement an absolute assignment of accounts that
    is not subject to the <i>PPSA</i>?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairbanx argues that a factoring assignment of an
    account is effectively a sale of that account because when an account is
    factored, it is assigned absolutely to the transferee with no reversionary
    right in the transferor. Fairbanx relies on s. 53(1) of the <i>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34 (the “<i>CLPA</i>”)<i> </i>for the proposition that an absolute
    assignment is subject only to equitable rights. Section 53(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>53(1) Any absolute assignment made on or after the
    31st day of December, 1897, by writing under the hand of the assignor, not
    purporting to be by way of charge only, of any debt or other legal chose in
    action of which express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee
    or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or
    claim such debt or chose in action is effectual in law, subject to all equities
    that would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee if
    this section had not been enacted, to pass and transfer the legal right to such
    debt or chose in action from the date of such notice, and all legal and other
    remedies for the same, and the power to give a good discharge for the same
    without the concurrence of the assignor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairbanx acknowledges, however, that ss. 2(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>ii) and (b) of the <i>PPSA</i> provide  that the <i>PPSA </i>applies to every transaction that in substance creates a
    security interest, including an assignment that secures the performance of an
    obligation (s. 2(a)(ii)) and also a transfer of an account or chattel paper
    even where it does not secure performance of an obligation (s. 2(b)). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Those sections
    read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. Subject to subsection 4(1), this Act applies to, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>every</span> transaction
    without regard to its form and without regard to the person who has title to
    the collateral that in substance creates a security interest including, without
    limiting the foregoing,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) <span class=GramE>an</span> assignment, lease or consignment that secures payment or performance of an
    obligation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>a</span> transfer of an
    account or chattel paper even though the transfer may not secure payment or
    performance of an obligation; and....</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concept of the <i>PPSA</i> applying to a transfer of accounts where the transfer does not secure the
    performance of an obligation, i.e. an absolute transfer, is difficult to
    reconcile conceptually with the purpose of the Act, which is to provide a
    priority system for lenders who take security over the borrower’s assets.
    However, application of the Act to a transfer of accounts is in fact necessary
    for the effective operation of the <i>PPSA</i> to ensure that one system of priorities based on notice through registration
    and searches, applies to all transactions that affect entitlement to a
    borrower’s assets. The effect is that anyone who intends to lend money and to
    take security on the assets of a debtor, including on its accounts receivable,
    will be able to ascertain, by searching under the <i>PPSA</i>, whether and to what extent those assets have already been encumbered
    in any way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Ronald C.C. Cuming, Catherine Walsh, Roderick J.
    Wood, <i>Personal Property Security Law </i>(
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Irwin Law,
    2005), the authors explain the policy rationale for extending the registration
    requirement to the assignment of accounts, at p. 90:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Endemic to each type of transaction is the
    potential for third-party deception and the consequent commercial disruptions
    that this entails....  In the case of a
    transfer of an account, the transferor retains apparent control of the account
    even though she no longer owns or has any interest in it.  By bringing these transactions within the
    scope of the registration and priority rules of the PPSA, third parties are
    placed in the position of being able to discover the existence of these
    interests before dealing with a[n]... assignor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that there may be a conflict between the
    application of the <i>CLPA</i> and the <i>PPSA</i> respecting an assignment of
    accounts under a factoring arrangement, that conflict is resolved by s. 73 of
    the <i>PPSA</i>, which provides that in the
    case of any conflict between the <i>PPSA</i> and any other Act except the <i>Consumer
    Protection Act</i>, <i>2002</i>, the applicable
    provision of the <i>PPSA</i> prevails. The <i>PPSA </i>therefore applies to the assignment
    of accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, Fairbanx tried to register its assignment
    under the <i>PPSA</i>. Had it done so
    effectively, it would have had priority over the bank’s subsequently acquired
    interest in the debtor’s <span class=GramE>accounts.</span> However, because
    Fairbanx’s registration was ineffective by virtue of the incorrect spelling of
    the debtor’s name, the bank’s properly perfected security interest ranked ahead
    of Fairbanx’s interest in the accounts.  This remains the case even though value was paid and all steps were
    taken to achieve an absolute assignment of the two accounts that are in issue
    in this application. The assignment did not remove those accounts from the
    security interest of the bank, which applied in this case, on the date of the
    debtor’s bankruptcy.</p>
  <h3>Issue 2: Is Fairbanx’s registration under the incorrectly spelled name of the
    debtor nevertheless valid under s. 46(4) of the <i>PPSA</i>, thereby standing in priority to the bank’s security?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, Fairbanx argues that its
    registration against the misspelled name of the debtor is effective by virtue
    of s. 46(4) of the <i>PPSA</i>. That section
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>46(4) A financing statement or financing change
    statement is not invalidated nor is its effect impaired by reason only of an
    error or omission therein or in its execution or registration unless a
    reasonable person is likely to be misled materially by the error or omission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairbanx argues that because the debtor effectively
    carried on business under the incorrectly spelled “Friction Technology
    Consultants Inc.”, a reasonable person would search under that name and
    therefore would not be materially misled by Fairbanx’s error in registering
    under that name. The evidence of that proposition is in this record: the
    respondent bank did in fact search under that name and found Fairbanx’s
    registration. Therefore, the bank, unarguably a reasonable person, was not
    materially misled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leading case on the effect of s. 46(4) of the <i>PPSA</i> is this court’s decision in <i>Re Lambert</i> (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 108,
    leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 555. There the court
    reviewed both the legislative history of the section and the history of the
    case law that applied it. Importantly, that history clarified that a creditor’s
    subjective knowledge of the existence of a financing statement or its
    registration is irrelevant. The test is an objective one – whether a reasonable
    person would be materially misled by an error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another important feature of s. 46(4) is that a registered
    financing statement with an error is <i>prima
    facie</i> effective. It only loses its effect if a reasonable person would be
    materially misled by the error. Therefore, the meaning and effect of that
    qualifier must be analyzed in the context of the purpose of the registration
    system and the importance of maintaining the integrity of that system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his text, <i>Secured
    Transactions in Personal Property in Canada, </i>2d. ed., looseleaf
    (Scarborough: Carswell, 1989), Professor Richard H. McLaren describes the
    purpose of the <i>PPSA</i> registration
    system in the following way, at para. 30.01:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The personal property security registration system
    provides the vehicle to permit registration of a security interest and a
    non-possessory repair or storage lien.  It also provides information about the transaction and a means whereby a
    person who is intending to purchase personal property or to lend money on the
    security of personal property can determine whether the owner has granted a
    security interest in the property as security for a debt.  This informational function is accomplished
    by providing a mechanism by which a search of registrations under the Act may
    be made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The purpose of the registration system is to
    provide enough information to enable a person searching the system to know who
    to contact to obtain information regarding a secured transaction.  It is for this reason that the registration
    system is referred to as a notice-filing system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, when a person searches under the debtor’s
    name and finds registrations of financing statements and financing change
    statements, those registrations contain information about the secured
    transaction, about the debtor, about the security and about the lender. Some of
    that information may contain an error. For example, a financing statement may
    contain an outdated address of the debtor. A new creditor who knows the current
    address of the debtor could be materially misled about whether the registration
    is against the same debtor. Under s. 46(4), a court would have to determine
    whether a reasonable person would be so misled. Arguably, the person who
    conducts the search could make further inquiries using the information
    available from the search in order to try to ascertain whether the debtor at
    the new address is the same person or entity as at the previous address. On the
    other hand, there might be reasons in a particular case why that would not be
    possible, or if possible, might not be reliable. It would ultimately be for the
    court to decide, based on the objective criteria, whether a reasonable person
    would be materially misled about the identity of the debtor in that case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, where the error in the registered financing
    statement is in the debtor’s name, no registration will be disclosed by a
    search of the correct name<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></span></a>.
    Therefore, the error in the debtor’s name will not come to the attention of the
    person searching. In those circumstances, s. 46(4) cannot properly apply
    because the issue of whether the error would materially mislead a reasonable
    person never arises where the person searching does not find the registration
    that contains the error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But even where the reasonable person who searches finds
    the registration against the incorrectly spelled name of the debtor, either by
    specifically searching that name as occurred in this case, or because the
    certificate discloses the registration under s. 43(3), that person may not be
    able to know whether the misspelled name is an error or the proper spelling of
    the name of another similarly named person or corporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In either case, the curative provision does not apply
    to validate the error. The reason is that s. 46(4) maintains the effect of a
    financing statement registered with an error as a perfected security interest
    of the registering creditor against the secured assets of the named debtor. If
    the name of the debtor is incorrect on the registered financing statement, then
    the registration will not perfect the creditor’s security interest in the
    assets of the correctly named debtor. Of course, the creditor still has an
    unperfected security interest which ranks behind all properly perfected
    security interests in the same collateral.</p>
