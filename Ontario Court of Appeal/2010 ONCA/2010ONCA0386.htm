  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Geoffrey Allan Wellwood, sued the
    appellants in two separate but identical actions for damages for malicious prosecution,
    negligent investigation and breach of his <i>Charter</i> rights.  Both actions were eventually
    dismissed by the registrar, as abandoned due to delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On review of the dismissal orders before the master, it
    was accepted that the first action was a nullity as against the Crown since the
    respondent had failed to comply with the notice requirements of the <i>Proceedings <span class=GramE>Against</span> the Crown Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 27.  The master declined to set aside the dismissal of the second
    action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal by the respondent to a single judge of the
    Divisional Court, the master’s ruling was set aside and an order was granted
    permitting the respondent to amend his pleading and proceed with the second
    action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal to this court in two separate
    appeals, asking that the order of the Divisional Court judge be set aside and
    that the master’s decision be reinstated.  For reasons that follow, I would allow the appeals.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>II.        Facts </h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>            </span>(1)       Chronology
    of Events</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2000, the respondent was charged with the first
    degree murder of his wife, Karen Wellwood, who had died in 1999.  On January 8, 2004, the murder charge was
    withdrawn when it emerged that Mrs. Wellwood’s death was a suicide and an
    expert’s report regarding the cause of her death had been misinterpreted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two lawsuits followed.  On July 7, 2004, the respondent provided the appellants with written
    notice of his damages claim.  On the same
    day, he issued a notice of action against the appellants, claiming damages for
    malicious prosecution, negligent investigation and <i>Charter</i> breaches.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  A statement of claim was filed on August 4,
    2004 (the “First Action”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following month, on September 7, 2004, the respondent
    commenced a second lawsuit against the appellants, in which he advanced the
    same claims as those set out in the First Action (the “Second Action”).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant chronology of events is detailed at
    Appendix “A”.  The following events are
    of primary interest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statements of claim in the actions were served in
    mid-December 2004.  On January 19, 2005,
    the registrar dismissed the First Action as abandoned under rules 77.08 and
    77.17(1) of the<i> Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (the “Rules”).  He
    made a similar order in respect of the Second Action on November 25, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early 2005, counsel for the Crown appellants and the
    appellant, The Bradford West Gwillimbury/Innisfil Police Services Board,
    wrongly named as South Simcoe Police Force (the “Board”), informed the
    respondent’s counsel of errors made in the naming of certain of the defendants
    in both the First and Second Actions and requested amendments to the
    respondent’s pleadings to correct the misnomers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, the respondent’s counsel advised on March
    3, 2005 that he was drafting materials to obtain the necessary amendment order
    and to set aside the dismissal of the First Action.  The requisite motion was scheduled to be
    heard on each of April 28, July 26, October 4, and November 9, 2005.  However, the respondent did not proceed with
    the motion on any of those dates. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 31, 2005, the respondent’s counsel provided
    opposing counsel with motion materials for a consent order correcting the
    identified misnomers in the respondent’s pleadings and setting aside the
    dismissal of the First Action.  Crown
    counsel declined to consent to the proposed order regarding the First Action,
    asserting that it was a nullity, and requested amendments to correct misnomers
    in the respondent’s pleading in the Second Action.  Counsel for the Board reiterated her request
    for amendments to correct the misnomers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 9, 2005, the motion originally scheduled
    for hearing in late April 2005 was marked in the court records as
    abandoned.  Shortly thereafter, on
    November 25, 2005, the Second Action was dismissed by the registrar as
    abandoned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent took no further steps to advance the
    matter, or to deal with the dismissal orders, for almost one year.  On September 27, 2006, the respondent’s
    counsel sought the appellants’ consent to the proposed consolidation of the two
    actions and the setting aside of both dismissal orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s motions materials were finally served
    on April 24, 2007.  By that time, more
    than 27 months from the date of the dismissal of the First Action, almost 17
    months from the date of the dismissal of the Second Action and approximately 15
    and one-half months since the expiry of the applicable limitation period had
    elapsed.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his motions materials, the respondent sought orders:
    (i) setting aside the dismissal orders; (ii) consolidating the two actions;
    (iii) amending his statements of claim; and <span class=GramE>(iv) extending</span> the time within which to serve the amended statements of claim (the “Motions”).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(2)       Master’s Decision</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motions were argued on October 31, 2007 before the master.  The setting aside of the dismissal orders was
    sought under rule 37.14 of the Rules, which provides in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>37.14(1) A party or other person who,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(c) <span class=GramE>is</span> affected by an order of a registrar,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>may</span> move to set aside or vary the order, by a notice of motion that is served
    forthwith after the order comes to the person’s attention and names the first
    available hearing date that is at least three days after service of the notice
    of motion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)  On a motion under subrule (1), the court may
    set aside or vary the order on such terms as are just.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master concluded that the respondent had failed to
    satisfy the requirements of rule 37.14(1) “since the motions were not served
    forthwith and the first available hearing dates were not named”.  She held that the Motions should be dismissed
    on this ground alone since, in her <span class=GramE>view,</span> the Rules
    provide no discretion to relieve against the time requirements of rule 37.14(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the master went on to consider whether it
    was just to set aside the dismissal orders under rule 37.14(2).  Her reasons confirm that she recognized, correctly,
    that an order under rule 37.14(2) is discretionary in nature.  She was also alert to the four factors
    identified in <i>Reid v. Dow Corning Corp.</i> (2001), 11 C.P.C. (5th) 80, rev’d on other grounds (2002), 48 C.P.C. (5th) 93
    (Ont. Div. Ct.), as relevant to the determination of whether relief under rule
    37.14 should be granted: (i) explanation of the litigation delay; (ii) whether the
    dismissal order was the result of inadvertence; (iii) whether the motion to set
    aside was brought promptly; and (iv) whether there is any prejudice to the
    defendant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent with this court’s decision in <i>Scaini v. Prochnicki</i> (2007), 85 O.R.
    (3d) 179, the master also properly directed herself that a contextual approach,
    which seeks to balance the respective interests of the parties, rather than a
    rigid application of the <i>Reid</i> factors, is required on a rule 37.14 inquiry.  Quoting <i>Scaini</i> at para. 24, the
    master stated: “The key point is that the <span class=GramE>court consider</span> and weigh all relevant factors to determine the order that is just in the
    circumstances of the particular case.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master then undertook an analysis of the factors
    relevant in this case to the decision whether to set aside the dismissal orders.  She held as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><i>timely notice of the claims</i> – this
    factor favoured the respondent, as the appellants were put on notice of the
    claims at an early date and service of the claims was timely;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><i>progress of the litigation</i> – this factor
    favoured the appellants, as no meaningful steps were taken by the respondent,
    apart from serving the claims and eventually bringing the Motions, to advance
    the progress of the litigation; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><i>delay in bringing the Motions to set aside
    the dismissal orders</i> – this factor favoured the appellants;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
class=GramE><i>explanation</i></span><i> for delay/solicitor inadvertence</i> – the
    respon-dent failed to provide an adequate explanation for his delay in bringing
    the Motions.  In particular, he failed to
    discharge his onus to establish that the delay was inadvertent rather than
    intentional.  This factor also favoured
    the appellants; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
class=GramE><i>prejudice</i></span><i> and the prospects for a fair trial</i> – as
    the applicable two-year limitation period had expired by the time of the
    Motions, there was deemed prejudice to the appellants occasioned by the
    respondent’s delay in bringing the Motions.  Further, in light of the nature of the evidence that would be required
    to meet the respondent’s allegation of malicious or negligent prosecution, the
    prospects for a fair trial had been compromised with the passage of time. As a
    result, the master was unable “to conclude that a fair trial is
    available”.  These considerations also favoured
    the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master next sought to balance the competing interests
    of the parties, to arrive at a just order.  She ruled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Taking all of the factors into consideration, I am
    of the view that delay in bringing the motions, the significant passage of time
    since the events giving rise to the Actions (Karen’s death in 1999, the charges
    laid in 2000 and the withdrawal of the charges in 2004), the delay in
    prosecuting the Actions and the deemed prejudice to the [appellants] warrant
    the dismissal of the motions.  In my
    view, the factors that favour (or might possibly favour) the [respondent] –
    being, timely service and notice of the claim and possible solicitor
    inadvertence, are not sufficient to persuade me that the Registrar’s dismissals
    ought to be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the master dismissed the Motions.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated January 21, 2009, the Divisional Court
    judge allowed the respondent’s appeal from the master’s decision in part.  He set aside the registrar’s dismissal of the
    Second Action and directed that the respondent deliver an amended statement of
    claim in the Second Action – naming the correct defendants – within 20
    days.  As there was no need to revive the
    First Action, the dismissal of that action was left undisturbed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge concluded that the master erred
    in two respects.  First, she erred by
    holding that she had no discretion to extend the time requirements of rule
    37.14(1).  In the Divisional Court judge’s
    view, the jurisdiction to relieve against these requirements is afforded by rule
    2.03, which states: “The court may, only where and as necessary in the interest
    of justice, dispense with compliance with any rule at any time.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as I describe in more detail later in these
    reasons, the Divisional Court judge held that the master erred by failing to
    properly assess the responsibility for the delay occasioned in this case and
    the prejudice suffered by the appellants.  In the Divisional Court judge’s opinion, these errors were palpable and
    overriding, thus requiring appellate intervention.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.      Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    grounds of appeal raised by the appellants are encapsulated in the following three
    issues</span>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is the proper standard of review on appeal from a
    master’s discretionary order under rule 37.14?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court judge err in his application
    of the proper standard of review by substituting his findings concerning delay and
    prejudice for those of the master?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court judge otherwise err in his
    treatment of the master’s analysis of delay and prejudice?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.      Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Standard of Review on Appeal from Master’s Order </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on this court’s recent decision in <i>Zeitoun v. Economical Insurance Group</i> (2009) ONCA 415, it is now settled law in Ontario that an appeal from a
    master’s decision is not a rehearing.  Rather,
    on questions of fact and mixed fact and law, deference applies and the role of
    the reviewing court is limited.  An appellate
    court cannot substitute its interpretation of the facts or reweigh the evidence
    simply because it takes a different view of the evidence from that of the
    master.  On questions of law, the
    correctness standard applies: see <i>Housen
    v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; <i>H.L.
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.</p>
  <h4 style='

    Court Judge’s </span></h4>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Application
    of Standard of Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the Divisional Court judge
    erred in his application of the governing standard of review on appeal from the
    master’s order by engaging in a rehearing or reweighing of the evidence and by
    concluding that his own “ultimate balancing of all of the factors” favoured the
    respondent.  In so doing, the appellants
    argue, the Divisional Court judge wrongly substituted his own discretion for
    that of the master, thereby exceeding his appellate jurisdiction and committing
    reversible error.   While I conclude that the appeals should be
    allowed, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, while he did not have the benefit of this
    court’s decision in <i>Zeitoun</i>, the Divisional
    Court judge’s reasons reveal that he was fully cognizant of the applicable standards
    of review and, therefore, of the limits on his appellate jurisdiction.  He approached his task with those standards
    at the forefront, beginning his analysis with reference to the appropriate
    standards and making explicit mention of the Divisional Court’s decision in <i>Zeitoun</i><a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> and the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Housen</i>.  Further, in his ensuing analysis, he
    correctly focused on the standards applicable to the issues raised.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, with respect and as I will explain, it is my
    opinion that the Divisional Court judge erred in his assessment of delay and
    prejudice and hence, in his conclusion that the master’s findings on these
    issues were tainted by palpable and overriding error.  I now turn to consideration of the master’s
    key findings.</p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Authority to Relieve Against</span></h4>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Time Requirements of
    Rule 37.14(1)</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the master’s ruling that she had no
    discretion to extend the time requirements of rule 37.14(1).  Before this court, the parties accepted the
    Divisional Court judge’s conclusion that this ruling was an error.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 2.03 is clear and unambiguous.  To repeat, it states: “The court may, only
    where and as necessary in the interest of justice, dispense with compliance <i>with any rule at any time</i>” (emphasis
    added).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This rule provides the court with a general discretion
    to relieve against the time requirements of any of the Rules, at any stage of a
    proceeding, if one essential precondition is satisfied: the court must first
    conclude that such relief is necessary in the interest of justice.  Nothing in the language of rule 37.14(1)
    exempts it from what the Divisional Court judge aptly described as “the
    overarching discretion afforded to the court by rule 2.03”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master does not appear to have considered her
    authority under rule 2.03 to relieve against the respondent’s failure to
    satisfy the time requirements of rule 37.14(1).  This omission no doubt led to her erroneous statement that “there [was]
    no discretion to be exercised” in relation to those time requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, on the facts of this case, this error is
    inconsequential.  The master undertook an
    examination of the events that led to the Motions and specifically considered
    whether the dismissal orders ought to be set aside under rule 37.14(2).  She correctly noted that: “[T]he setting
    aside of the Registrar’s dismissal orders is discretionary and requires a
    consideration of relevant factors.”  Thus, in the end, the master properly recognized that she had discretion
    under rule 37.14(2) to set aside the dismissal orders if such an order was
    just.  In these circumstances, her
    failure to recognize that she also had discretion under rule 2.03 to relieve
    against rule 37.14(1) is immaterial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Delay</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge held that the master
    appropriately assessed all the relevant <i>Reid</i> factors, with the exception of her consideration of delay and prejudice.  With respect to the issue of delay, he
    concluded that the master made a palpable and overriding error by finding that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he defendants were not in any way responsible
    for the delay and, in fact, the defendants were prepared to consent to the
    relief until the passage of time was too great.  This is not one of those cases where the defendants have taken advantage
    of an administrative dismissal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge disagreed with the master’s
    holding that the appellants were not in any way responsible for the delay.  In his opinion, the appellants’ decision to
    defer the delivery of their statements of defence until the respondent had
    corrected the irregularities in his pleadings, and their own failure to seek a
    court order correcting those irregularities, contributed to the overall delay.  For these reasons, he concluded, in effect,
    that the master’s delay findings were fatally flawed.  I disagree, for four reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the master’s delay findings must be understood
    in the context of her full reasons.  Read
    as a whole, her reasons confirm that the delay to which she referred was the
    delay in bringing the Motions to set aside the dismissal orders – a delay that
    was entirely attributable to the respondent.  In contrast, as is evident from his reliance on the appellants’ failure
    to plead, the delay addressed by the Divisional Court judge was the delay in
    the progress of the First and Second Actions <i>prior</i> to the registrar’s dismissal orders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master, however, was concerned with whether the
    respondent had complied with the time requirements of rule 37.14(1).  She noted, correctly, that the respondent did
    not bring the Motions “forthwith” and ruled that the evidence of his
    explanation for this failure was “thin”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was in this specific, post-dismissal context that
    the master attached no responsibility to the appellants for delay.  I see no error in this finding.  On the contrary, it was amply supported by
    the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the master’s characterization of the
    respondent’s purported explanation for the delay in bringing the Motions was
    generous.  In a three-sentence affidavit
    sworn by him and filed on the Motions, the respondent said only: “It has always
    been and continues to be my intention to proceed with this action” and that he
    had instructed his solicitors to move to set aside “the dismissal Order”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an affidavit sworn by one of the respondent’s
    counsel, this explanation for the delay was offered: “The delay was the product
    of our performing a number of re-drafts [of the respondent’s pleadings and,
    arguably, Motions materials] in an attempt to deal with [Crown counsel’s]
    concerns while not prejudicing our client’s remedies.”  Later in the same affidavit, the deponent
    suggested that part of the delay arose when it became necessary to report the
    matter to the insurers of the respondent’s original counsel.  The focus of this suggested explanation was
    also the delay in bringing the Motions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the master had appropriate regard to the overall
    progress of the litigation.  In assessing
    the justice of setting aside the dismissal orders under rule 37.14(2), she
    addressed this aspect of delay under various headings, including: (i) “Whether
    the claim was served within the prescribed time”; (ii) “Whether there were
    steps taken in the action”; (iii) “Whether the delay was intentional or
    contumelious: Solicitor inadvertence”; and (iv) “Delay in Bringing the Motions
    to Set Aside the Registrar’s Dismissal Orders”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master outlined the timeline of pertinent events
    relating to the litigation in some detail.  Her reasons indicate that she was aware of the actions taken by the
    parties to advance the litigation.  She
    considered those actions and the evidence filed, finding that: (i) the
    appellants did not take advantage of an administrative dismissal; (ii) the
    respondent took no meaningful steps to regularize his pleadings or to bring the
    Motions on a timely basis; and (iii) importantly, she could not conclude that
    the respondent’s delay was not intentional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the master assigned no responsibility
    for delay to the appellants due to their failure to plead.  But the record before the master established
    that, on notice to the respondent in early 2005, the appellants deferred the
    delivery of their statements of defence pending the respondent’s motion to
    correct the admitted irregularities in his pleadings.  The appellants were assured that the
    respondent intended to bring the necessary motion.  Thereafter, although a corrective motion was
    scheduled to be heard on at least four prior <span class=GramE>occasions,</span> the respondent did not deliver appropriate motion materials until late April,
    2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout this entire timeframe – early 2005 to late
    April 2007 – no demand was made by the respondent’s counsel for delivery of the
    appellants’ statements of defence.  Nor
    did he ever suggest that the deferral of the defence pleadings was
    unacceptable.  On the contrary, based on
    the communications among counsel, it appears that the deferral of the delivery
    of defence pleadings was accepted.  As
    events unfolded, the considerable delay in the hearing of the Motions was not
    occasioned by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note that under Ontario’s Rules for
    contemporary litigation, the party who commences a proceeding bears primary
    responsibility for its progress.  For
    this reason, the initiating litigant generally suffers the consequences of a
    dilatory regard for the pace of the litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 37.14(1) itself provides a useful illustration of
    this principle.  Under that rule, a
    delinquent plaintiff bears the consequences of an administrative dismissal of
    his or her action, itself occasioned by delay, where a motion to set aside the
    dismissal is not served “forthwith” and the plaintiff fails to name “the first
    available hearing date” for the motion after the dismissal order comes to the
    plaintiff’s attention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would be unusual, although technically possible, for
    a misnamed defendant to apply to the court to correct the misnomer in the
    plaintiff’s pleading.  In this case, the
    misnomers at issue were drawn to the attention of the respondent’s counsel virtually
    from the outset of the First and Second Actions.  I do not read the Rules as obliging the
    appellants to have done more.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore do not agree that the master made a
    palpable and overriding error in her delay findings.  Indeed, on this record, I can find no fault
    with those findings.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(5)       Prejudice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appellants filed no evidence of actual
    prejudice.  The Board’s counsel filed a
    brief affidavit sworn by an associate lawyer in which the deponent indicated
    that Board counsel’s litigation file was “closed” in 2006 following the
    dismissal of the Second Action and, until September 27, 2006, “there was no
    sign of the Plaintiff taking any steps to have the Dismissal Order set aside”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ resistance to the Motions on the ground
    of prejudice was based, first, on the overall delay in the case, including the
    lengthy passage of time between the date of the last dismissal order (November
    25, 2005) and the date on which the Motions were first properly brought (April
    24, 2007) and ultimately argued (October 31, 2007), and second, on the expiry
    of the limitation period (January 8, 2006).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument before the master, the appellants also
    appear to have maintained that the revival of the Second Action would lead to
    prejudice since a defence to the causes of action advanced by the respondent –
    especially the claim of malicious prosecution – would require evidence not
    contained in the Crown disclosure brief in the previous criminal case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s counsel said in his affidavit filed on
    the Motions that the Crown disclosure materials had been preserved and were
    available for use in the civil litigation.  He therefore argued that “no prejudice [would] befall the Defendants” if
    orders setting aside the administrative dismissal orders were granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master held that the expiry of the limitation
    period gave rise to deemed prejudice to the appellants.  She rejected the respondent’s claim that a
    fair trial was nonetheless available as the Crown disclosure brief had been
    preserved and necessary evidence was in the appellants’ possession.  In her opinion, the evidence of other
    witnesses, including that of a key expert witness who resided in the United
    States, would be “germane” to the litigation.  As well, the <span class=GramE>allegation of malicious or negligent
    prosecution “require[</span>d] different evidence than that which could be
    found in the Crown disclosure brief”.  The master was also of the view that the overall passage of time from
    the date in 2000 when the murder charge was laid and from the date of the withdrawal
    of that charge in 2004 resulted in prejudice to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master concluded that: (i) the delay in bringing
    the Motions, (ii) the “significant passage of time since the events giving rise
    to the Actions”, (iii) the delay in prosecuting the civil actions, and (iv) the
    deemed prejudice to the appellants, warranted the dismissal of the Motions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge disagreed.  He held that the master made a palpable and
    overriding error by relying on the passage of time and the expiry of the
    limitation period to support her finding of prejudice.  In his view, the absence of evidence of
    actual prejudice to the appellants and the fact that the appellants received
    early notice of the respondent’s claims favoured the respondent on the
    requisite balancing exercise under rule 37.14.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core of the Divisional Court judge’s reasoning is
    set out in the following passages from his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[75]     <i>[It] is clear that the expiration of the
    limitation period is not sufficient to give rise to a presumption of
    prejudice.  <span class=GramE>Rather, an
    inordinate delay after the expiration is required for a presumption of
    prejudice: Woodheath Developments Ltd. v. Goldman (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 658, at
    para.</span> 29, [aff’d (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 731 (Div. Ct.)].</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[76]     <i>Prejudice, then, arises not simply because
    of the passing of a <span class=GramE>particular,</span> and somewhat arbitrary
    date.  It arises because it is presumed
    that without notice of a claim, it would be unreasonable for a party to be
    expected to defend against it after the passing of an undue period of time</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[77]     <i>Of course, prejudice also arises with a
    passage of time so great that a party relies upon the finality implied by
    it.  But it is not the expiration of a
    limitation period per se that creates the presumption of prejudice</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[79]     The
    point of a limitation period is to ensure that a party who is open to liability
    is made aware of that liability within a reasonable timeframe.  Here, the party was aware of the action
    almost from the time the limitation period began to run, because the statement
    of claim was issued to the correct party, if improperly named.  No prejudice can arise where the limitation period
    was met, and the defendants were made aware of the claim before it expired.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[80]     It
    must also be remembered that it is not merely prejudice that is required, but
    “unfair” or “significant” prejudice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[84]     [I]n
    the circumstances here, especially with early notice of the claim and no evidence
    of actual prejudice, the ultimate balancing of all the factors favours the
    plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not agree with the entirety of this
    description of the governing principles concerning prejudice.  In particular, as I read the applicable
    authorities, the expiry of a limitation period can give rise to some
    presumptive prejudice, the strength of which increases with the passage of
    time.  Where the presumption arises, the
    plaintiff bears the burden of rebutting the presumption, on proper
    evidence.  Where the presumption is so
    displaced, the onus shifts to the defendant to establish actual prejudice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to review the numerous authorities
    touching on the issue of deemed prejudice due to the expiry of a limitation period
    in these reasons.  Reference to some of
    the pertinent authorities, many of which were mentioned by the Divisional Court
    judge, will suffice.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Pertinent
    Jurisprudence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  In <i>Kassam v. Sitzer</i>, [2004] O.T.C. 731
    (S.C.), aff’d, [2005] O.J. No. 1849 (Div. Ct.), Master Dash held at para. 50 that
    where a plaintiff explains the delay at issue, the administrative dismissal of
    an action should not be set aside unless: (i) the delay or the default has been
    intentional and contumelious; <i>or</i> (ii)
    there has been an inordinate and inexcusable delay giving rise to a substantial
    risk that a fair trial would not be possible; <i>or</i> (iii) there would be actual serious prejudice to the defendant
    if the action was not dismissed.  He
    continued at para. 53:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the delay is inordinate and is inexcusable, in
    that it results from the inadvertence, inattention or negligence of counsel (or
    a self-represented plaintiff), then the court must ascertain whether the delay
    gives rise to a substantial risk that a fair trial would not be possible.  A “substantial risk” may not require proof of
    actual prejudice.  <i>Prejudice will be presumed after passage of a limitation period and it
    will be presumed that memories of witnesses fade over time</i>.  <i>If the
    defendant has been unaware of a claim being asserted either by notice of the
    claim or by service of the statement of claim, such that he has been unable to
    undertake a timely investigation, then this may be taken into account in
    determining whether there is a substantial risk that a fair trial would not be
    possible.</i>  <i>The plaintiff can overcome the presumption of prejudice </i>for example
    by evidence that relevant documents have been preserved, key witnesses are
    available, certain elements of the claim may not be in issue, and in the case
    of personal injury, that medical evidence of the progress of the injuries is
    available.<i>  The defendant would then have a burden of
    adducing actual evidence that there is a substantial risk that, as a result of
    the delay, a fair trial would not be possible.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge distinguished <i>Kassam</i> from this case on the basis that
    the defendant in <i>Kassam</i> did not
    receive notice of the claim until after the expiry of the applicable limitation
    period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that, in <span class=GramE><i>Kassam</i>,</span> the absence of prior
    notice of the claim strengthened the defendant’s assertion of prejudice.  However, in my view, properly read, the
    holding in <i>Kassam</i> of presumptive
    prejudice on the expiry of a limitation period is not restricted to cases of no
    prior notice of the claim.  Rather, the
    absence of prior notice is but one factor, albeit a compelling one, to be taken
    into account when assessing whether the prospects of a fair trial have been
    compromised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has also considered whether the expiry of a
    limitation period gives rise to deemed prejudice, however slight.  In <i>Worrall
    v. Powell</i>, [1969] 2 O.R. 634, a writ was issued before the expiration of
    the limitation period but there was a four and one-half year delay in serving
    the statement of claim.  Justice Aylesworth
    noted at para. 4 that, in these circumstances, a major factor to be taken into
    consideration was the expiration of the limitation period “because such
    expiration raises a presumption of prejudice suffered by the defendants”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Worrall</i> was
    followed by this court’s decision in <i>Clairmonte
    v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i>, [1970] 3 O.R. 97.  In <i>Clairemonte</i>,
    Jessup J.A. recognized at para. 43 that the nature of some actions, for example
    negligence actions, will peculiarly hamper the defence “by the erosion of the
    memory of witnesses through the passage of time” and that, in those types of
    action, the expiry of a limitation period may be taken as the “legislature’s
    measure” of when a defendant may be presumed to be prejudiced by delay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Jessup then clarified at para. 43 with respect
    to Aylesworth J.A.’s comments in <i>Worrall</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he force of the presumption mentioned by
    Aylesworth, J.A., will depend on the time which has passed after the expiration
    of a limitation period as well as on the nature of the action.  <i>While
    the presumption will speak as a barely audible caution immediately after a
    limitation period has expired, it may command with increasing imperativeness on
    the passage of a substantial time, depending on the cause of action.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge in this case relied on
    Laskin J.A.’s concurring reasons in <i>Clairemonte</i>,
    at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I say, with respect, that where an action has been
    commenced within the proper limitation period, there can be no pretence that
    any right of a defendant to rely on a limitation period is prejudiced, because
    the course of the action is protracted.  His right, if any, is to have the action dismissed if it is not
    regularly prosecuted to trial; and if he succeeds, it is the plaintiff who will
    suffer as a result of the intervention of a limitation period.  Indeed, to speak of prejudice to the
    defendant on the basis of the expiry of a limitation period which would protect
    him only if the application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution
    succeeded, is to beg the very question that has to be decided; it is to use the
    results of success on the application as a ground for granting it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Clairemonte </i>was
    a case where an action was commenced within a limitation period and the
    progress of the action thereafter was protracted, following which the defendant
    sought to have the action dismissed for delay.  Justice Laskin held that, in that situation, the fact of the expiry of a
    limitation period prior to the dismissal motion was irrelevant.  The defendant’s cause for complaint concerned
    the undue delay in prosecuting the live action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not this case.  Here, the First and Second Actions were both dismissed, the limitation
    period expired, and inordinate delay transpired before the respondent moved to
    set aside the dismissal orders.  In the
    case at bar, if the dismissal of the Second Action were to be set aside, the
    appellants would lose the benefit both of court-sanctioned dismissal orders,
    which had already been granted in recognition of undue delay by the respondent,
    and of the expiry of the applicable limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court’s decision in <i>Armstrong v. McCall</i> (2006), 213 O.A.C. 229, is also
    instructive.  In <i>Armstrong</i>, although there was timely notice of the claim, the court
    gave the defendants the benefit of the presumption of prejudice in deciding
    “whether delay that is properly described as inordinate and inexcusable has
    given rise to a substantial risk that a fair trial for the defendant will not
    be possible” (at para. 20).  Further, at
    para. 11, the court endorsed the description of the test for dismissal of an
    action for delay articulated by Master Dash and accepted by the Divisional
    Court in <i>Woodheath, supra</i> at p. 732,
    reasoning in part as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principle to be applied on a motion to dismiss
    for delay is that the action should not be dismissed unless: (1) the default is
    intentional and contumelious; or (2) the plaintiff or his or her lawyers are
    responsible for the inexcusable delay that gives rise to a substantial risk
    that a fair trial might not now be possible.  <i>It is presumed that memories fade
    over time, and an inordinate delay after the cause of action arose or after the
    passage of [a] limitation period gives rise to a presumption of prejudice</i>.  <i>Where
    there is a presumption of</i> <i>prejudice,
    the defendant need not lead actual evidence of prejudice and the action will be
    dismissed for delay unless the plaintiff rebuts the presumption.</i>  The presumption of preju-dice may be rebutted … <i>If the presumption is rebutted then the
    action may still be dismissed if the defendant leads convincing evidence of
    actual prejudice</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Armstrong</i> involved
    a motion under Rule 24 to dismiss an action for delay, rather than a motion
    under rule 37.14 to set aside an existing dismissal order.  Nonetheless, as the memories of witnesses
    fade over time, the passage of an inordinate length of time after a cause of
    action arises or after an applicable limitation period expires gives rise to
    trial fairness concerns.  In my view,
    this is so even when timely notice of the claim has been provided.  This is consistent with the principle,
    articulated in <i>Clairmonte</i> by Jessup
    J.A. at para. 43 and quoted by the Divisional Court judge in this case at para.
    73, that the force of prejudice due to delay intensifies with the passage of
    time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have also considered the import of this court’s
    recent decision in <i>Finlay v. Paassen</i>,
    2010 ONCA 204, yet another appeal in which this court was asked to set aside
    the administrative dismissal of an action.  In <i>Finlay</i>, commenting in <i>obiter</i> at para. 34, Laskin J.A.
    expressed reservations as to the relevancy in that case of the running of the
    limitation period, which expired while the action was ongoing.  In those circumstances, he commented that the
    delay in the litigation had no bearing on the running of the limitation period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, importantly, unlike this case, the lawsuit in <i>Finlay</i> proceeded without any
    unreasonable delay before the dismissal order.  Further, the motion judge in <i>Finlay</i> held that the conduct of the delinquent litigant in not moving the litigation
    forward was not deliberate.  Again, that is
    not this case.  Here, on the findings of
    the master, the delay occasioned by the respondent was intentional.  That finding was not challenged before this
    court.  Moreover, I reiterate that, in
    this case, the respondent seeks to deprive the appellants of the security of
    the position gained by them from the delay-induced dismissal orders and the
    subsequent expiry of the limitation period.  I note that the limitation period had expired
    well before the respondent finally brought his Motions to even correct the
    misnomers in his pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mention must also be made of this court’s decision in <i>Marché d’Alimentation Denis Thériault Ltée. <span
class=GramE>v. Giant</span> Tiger Stores Ltd.</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 660.  In <i>Marché</i>,
    as in this case, the court was concerned with the question of when a litigant
    should be permitted to revive an action that had been dismissed for delay.  Justice Sharpe, writing for the court,
    indicated at para. 21 that the contextual approach mandated by <i>Scaini</i> to determine what is just in the
    circumstances of the particular case “invites the application of important
    underlying principles and values of the civil justice system that are inherent
    in the four <i>Reid</i> factors”.  In his ensuing discussion of these
    foundational principles and values,  Sharpe J.A. emphasized:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>that</span> modern civil procedure
    requires the discour-agement of delay and the enhancement of an active judicial
    role to ensure timely justice.  For this
    important reason, the <i>Reid</i> test requires
    an explanation for the delay occasioned in the litigation: para. 23;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>moreover</span>, “[T]here is a strong
    public interest in promoting the timely resolution of disputes.”  He noted: “Litigants are entitled to have
    their disputes resolved quickly so that they can get on with their lives.  Delay multiplies costs and breeds frustration
    and unfairness”: para. 25;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>that</span> excusing significant
    delay “risks undermining public confidence in the administration of justice”: para.
    32; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>on</span> the other hand, our civil
    justice system and the requirement of prejudice under the <i>Reid</i> test, favour “the goal of having disputes resolved on the
    merits”: para. 34.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These principles are implicated in this case.  So, too, is Sharpe J.A.’s elaboration in <i>Marché</i>, at paras. 37 and 38, of the
    particular importance of finality in litigation as a consideration in assessing
    prejudice:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finality, like the avoidance of unnecessary delay,
    is a central principle in the administration of justice.  “The law rightly seeks a finality to
    litigation” and finality is “a compelling consideration” (citation omitted).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>When an action has been disposed
    of in favour of a party, that party’s entitlement to rely on the finality
    principle grows stronger as the years pass.</span>  <i>Even
    when the order dismissing the action was made for delay or default and not on
    the merits, and even when the party relying on the order could still defend
    itself despite the delay, it seems to me that at some point the interest in
    finality must trump the opposite party’s plea for an indulgence</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as Gillese J.A. of this court indicated in <i>Hare v. Hare</i> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 766,
    at para. 41, the twin goals of finality and certainty in legal affairs and the
    prevention of indefinite liability underlie the creation of limitation
    periods.  As she observed at paras.
    41-2:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he words of this court in <i>Deaville v. Boegeman</i> (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 725 (Ont. C.A.), at
    729-30 are usefully recalled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>When limitation periods were under
    con-sideration by the common law courts in the 18th and 19th centuries, the
    judges described these limitation statutes as “statutes of repose” or “statutes
    of peace”.  The emphasis then was as it
    is today, on the necessity of giving security to members of society.  <i>Citizens
    would not expect to be disturbed once the limitation period had expired.</i>  <i>Today
    when a limitation period has expired it is considered that, generally speaking,
    a defendant need no longer be concerned about the location or preservation of
    evidence relevant to the particular claim or relevant to a claim which has not
    been made.</i>  <i>Further, the defendant is, presumably at that stage free to act and
    plan his life without concern for stale claims or claims of which he has no
    knowledge which have arisen out of the original incident.</i>  When considering the purpose of limitation
    periods, the maxim, although used frequently in other connections, <i>expedit reipublicae ut sit finis litium</i> is appropriate; <i>it is indeed in the
    public interest that there should be an end to litigation</i>.  [Citations omitted; Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Ontario Law Reform Commission explained the
    need for limitation periods in its <i>Report
    on Limitation of Actions</i> (Toronto: Department of the Attorney General,
    1969) at 9-10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Lawsuits should be brought within a reasonable
    time.  This is the policy behind
    limitation statutes.  These laws are
    designed to prevent persons from beginning actions once that reasonable time
    has passed.  Underlying the policy is <span
class=GramE>a recognition</span> that it is not fair that an individual should
    be subject indefinitely to the threat of being sued over a particular
    matter.  Nor is it in the interests of
    the community that disputes should be capable of dragging on
    inter-minably.  Furthermore, evidentiary
    problems are likely to arise as time passes.  Witnesses become forgetful or die: documents may be lost or
    destroyed.  Certainly, it is desirable
    that, at some point, there should be an end to the possibility of litigation in
    any dispute.  A statute of limitation is
    sometimes referred to as an “Act of peace”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Apart from the protection they give to potential
    defendants, limitation statutes enable the courts to function more effectively
    by ensuring that litigation is not started so long after the event that there
    are likely to be evidential difficulties.  In addition, the commercial world is able to carry on more
    smoothly.  The limitation statutes
    encourage early settlements so that the disrupting effect of unsettled claims
    on commercial intercourse is minimized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that <i>Finlay</i> does not depart in any way from the finality principle emphasized in <i>Marché</i> and <i>Hare</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, on the facts of this case, it is my view that invocation
    of the finality principle, in the context of full consideration of the other
    factors relevant to the decision whether to set aside the dismissal orders, was
    dispositive of the central issue before the master.  In particular, I note that the respondent
    failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of rule 37.14(1); that he
    failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for his delay in moving to set
    aside the dismissal orders; and that even when he determined to seek such
    relief, his motion for relief was not brought promptly.  In these circumstances, I conclude that this
    is the type of case described by Sharpe J.A. in <i>Marché</i>, in which finality must trump.  That said, as the Divisional Court judge held
    that the master’s prejudice analysis was also flawed, I turn to consideration
    of that analysis.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       Master’s Assessment of Prejudice</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, in arriving at her conclusion that
    justice required the dismissal of the Motions, the master considered the impact
    of deemed prejudice arising from the expiry of the limitation period.  She went on to consider the respondent’s
    assertion that a fair trial was nonetheless possible as all necessary relevant
    evidence allegedly had been preserved.  In rejecting that claim, the master properly considered whether the
    respondent had discharged his onus to rebut the presumption of prejudice to the
    appellants.  She concluded that he had
    not.  This was sufficient to dispose of
    the matter, as no requirement for a showing of actual prejudice arose in these
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, I emphasize, the master’s analysis of prejudice
    did not end there.  The master’s prejudice
    ruling was not anchored solely or even predominately on presumptive prejudice
    arising from the expiry of the limitation period.  Nor was it grounded in her view of the claim
    of actual prejudice apparently asserted by the appellants in oral argument
    before the master.  Rather, the master’s
    prejudice ruling was also based on her consideration of the “significant
    passage of time” from the date of the events giving rise to the litigation and
    the respondent’s inadequately explained delay in bringing the Motions and
    prosecuting the Second Action.  These
    were necessary and significant considerations under the contextual analytical
    framework mandated by <i>Scaini</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the master’s focus on the overall
    “significant” passage of time in this case included explicit reference to
    Sharpe J.A.’s caution in <i>Marché</i> of
    the importance of the finality principle when it is sought to set aside an
    action that has already been dismissed for delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, while the Divisional Court judge referred
    to <i>Marché</i> and to a party’s right to
    rely upon the finality implied by the passage of considerable time (at para.
    77), he failed to address the significance of the finality principle in his
    prejudice analysis and to apply it to the facts of this case.  With respect, his failure to do so was an
    error.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the issue of actual prejudice, I offer
    these observations.  First, as I have
    already said, in the circumstances of this case, there was no evidential burden
    on the appellants to demonstrate actual prejudice.  Second, as I read her reasons, the master’s
    ruling did not turn on the issue of actual prejudice.  Indeed, her consideration of actual prejudice
    appears incidental to her central reasoning, which I have already
    described.  Third, and in any event, the
    master observed that the allegation of malicious or negligent prosecution
    “require[d] different evidence than that which could be found in the Crown
    disclosure brief”.  Although this comment
    might have been differently worded, I take it as <span class=GramE>a
    recognition</span> of the fact that where, as here, negligent <i>investigation</i> and <i>Charter</i> breaches are alleged, the contents of the Crown disclosure
    brief concerning the prosecution would not fully address the causes of action
    alleged.  I agree.  Indeed, I think it self-evident.  Finally, the issue of evidence of actual
    prejudice cannot overtake the requirements of rule 37.14(1).  Under that rule, as I have indicated, the
    obligation to explain the significant delay occasioned in this case fell
    squarely on the respondent.  Simply put,
    he failed to discharge that controlling burden.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the master that the delay in prosecuting
    the Second Action and in bringing the Motions was inordinate.  Almost two years passed from the dismissal of
    the Second Action to the date of the hearing of the Motions and a delay of
    about one year and ten months occurred from the expiry of the limitation period
    to the hearing of the Motions.  And more
    than three years elapsed from the initial commencement of the litigation to the
    date when the respondent finally sought relief from the court to regularize his
    pleadings, consolidate the proceedings and set aside the dismissal orders.  The respondent demonstrated no sense of
    urgency to advance the litigation or to move to set aside the dismissal orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I underscore that the respondent failed to
    adduce a cogent explanation for the delay or sufficient evidence to rebut the
    presumption of prejudice arising from the delay in bringing the Motions and the
    expiry of the limitation period.  He
    failed to do so at his peril: see <i>Tanguay
    v. Brouse</i>, 2010 ONCA 73.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also failed to establish that the delay
    was the result of solicitor inadvertence.  Indeed, no such claim was advanced.  The master was not satisfied that the delay was unintentional.  I repeat, that finding was not challenged
    before this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given all these considerations, I see no error in the
    Master’s reliance on the expiry of the limitation period and the respondent’s
    inordinate delay in holding that there was prejudice to the appellants in this
    case.  Accordingly, I conclude that her order
    must be restored. </p>

    police his opinion that Mrs. Wellwood’s death was a “probable suicide” and
    stated that his office would have “ruled this case a suicide”.  At the invitation of the Crown, the court
    discharged Mr. Wellwood during the course of the 2004 preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after his discharge, Mr. Wellwood launched the
    two actions described in Cronk J.A.’s reasons.  Both actions, despite misnomers, were acknowledged to be against the
    same police and Crown defendants.  The
    allegations against the defendants included claims of negligent investigation
    and malicious prosecution.  Mr.
    Wellwood’s counsel at the time promptly served the defendants with the
    statements of claim, which contained full particulars of the allegations.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  The police defendants requested an indulgence
    in delivering their statements of defence so that they could investigate the
    allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The delay that followed is well-chronicled in the
    reasons and appendix to the reasons of Cronk J.A.  Those reasons demonstrate that the
    plaintiff’s counsel did not move expeditiously in attending to motions, even
    though the defendants were prepared to cooperate.  The plaintiff’s motion to amend the title of
    proceedings was initially scheduled to be heard on three occasions earlier in
    the year.  However, in November 2005, the
    motion was marked as abandoned.  About
    two weeks later, the second action was dismissed by the registrar.  About 10 months later, plaintiff’s counsel
    sought the defendants’ consent to the reinstatement of the action.  The defendants refused their consent.  At that point, plaintiff’s counsel advised
    the defendants he was reporting the matter to LawPro.  A different law firm came on the record for
    the plaintiff.  The new law firm
    proceeded with the motions to set aside the registrar’s order, which the master
    dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the comprehensive
    reasons of my colleague, Cronk J.A.  I
    agree with her that the Divisional Court judge (the appeal judge) correctly
    identified the master’s error regarding her authority to relieve against the
    dismissal order.  In light of the
    master’s alternative consideration of whether the order should be set aside in
    any event, the appeal judge, also correctly, did not rely on the master’s error
    as a reason to allow the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with Cronk J.A. that the appeal judge
    erred in attributing responsibility for the delay to the defendants,
    particularly in light of the approach of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, which largely place the burden on a
    plaintiff to ensure the progress of litigation.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite my agreement on these issues, as I will
    explain, it is my view that it was open to the appeal judge to conclude that
    the master’s reasons demonstrated reviewable error, including by deeming
    prejudice from the mere expiration of the limitation period.  In view of the errors, I conclude that it was
    both appropriate and necessary for the appeal judge to re-weigh the relevant
    factors to determine whether the registrar’s dismissal of the second action
    should be set aside.  In re-weighing
    those factors, the appeal judge was alert to the concerns arising from the
    plaintiff’s delay in bringing the motion to set aside the registrar’s dismissal
    order.  However, after considering that
    factor in the entire context, the appeal judge concluded that “the ultimate
    balancing of all of the factors favours the plaintiff”.  In my view, this consideration was available
    to the appeal judge in his exercise of discretion.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>

lang=EN-US>         The expiration of the
    limitation period</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After hearing submissions, the master invited counsel
    to make further submissions about the relevant limitation period.  This request for submissions, together with
    the structure of the master’s reasons, demonstrates that the expiration of the
    limitation period, and the prejudice the master deemed arose from that
    expiration, were important components of the balancing she undertook in
    exercising her decision to refuse to reinstate the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge took a different view and concluded
    that, provided an action is commenced within the limitation period, the passage
    of the date when the limitation period would otherwise have expired is
    irrelevant.  In reaching that conclusion,
    the appeal judge considered the relevant authorities, including the cases of<i> Worrall, Clairemonte, Armstrong, Woodheath </i>and<i> Marché,</i> discussed in the reasons of
    Cronk J.A. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Clairmonte,</i> B. Laskin J.A. pointed out in his concurring reasons that prejudice to the
    defendant does not arise if the action is brought within the prescribed
    time.  At p. 112, he explained: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I say, with respect, that where an action has been
    commenced within the proper limitation period, there can be no pretence that
    any right of a defendant to rely on a limitation period is prejudiced, because
    the course of the action is protracted. His right, if any, is to have the
    action dismissed if it is not regularly prosecuted to trial; and if he
    succeeds, it is the plaintiff who will suffer as a result of the intervention
    of a limitation period. Indeed, to speak of prejudice to the defendant on the
    basis of the expiry of a limitation period which would protect him only if the
    application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution succeeded, is to beg
    the very question that has to be decided; it is to use the results of success
    on the application as a ground for granting it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Finlay v.
    Paassen</i>, 2010 ONCA 204, at para. 34, albeit in <i>obiter</i>, J. I. Laskin J.A. observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not see how the running of the limitation
    period had any relevance to the motion. The action was started well within the
    limitation period and would be reinstated if the registrar’s order were set
    aside. Moreover, to be relevant, any prejudice from the “expiry” of a
    limitation period would have to be caused by the delay. In this case, however,
    to the extent that it can be said the limitation period “expired”, it did so in
    October 2005 while the action was ongoing. The delay itself had no bearing on
    the running of the limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague would distinguish this court’s decision in <i>Finlay</i> for three reasons.  First, my colleague refers to the absence of
    litigation delay in <i>Finlay</i> prior to
    the registrar’s dismissal.  However, the
    prejudice caused by litigation delay raises different considerations from
    prejudice deemed to have arisen from the mere expiration of a limitation
    period.  Second, my colleague
    distinguishes <i>Finlay</i> on the basis
    that the litigant’s delay in that case was not deliberate.  However, as I will discuss, there is an
    evidentiary difficulty with the master’s conclusion that the plaintiff’s delay
    in this case was deliberate.  Finally, my
    colleague observes that <i>Finlay</i> did
    not depart from the “finality” principle emphasized in <i>Marché </i>and <i>Hare</i>.  That is correct.  However, the principle of finality, balanced
    by the objective of deciding cases on their merits, informs the entire context
    for the analysis.  It is not a
    stand-alone ground.  Rather, it is
    reflected in each of the relevant considerations that influence the decision
    whether to reinstate the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the appeal judge observed that the action
    was started and served long before the expiration of the limitation
    period.  The parties continued to
    correspond about the case until shortly before the registrar’s dismissal order.  The defendants would not have been notified
    of the registrar’s dismissal of the action because they had not filed
    statements of defence.  They were not on
    the record.  Thus, it seems that the
    defendants would have believed the action remained outstanding until the
    plaintiff wrote seeking their consent to its reinstatement.  In those circumstances, the defendants could
    not have been prejudiced by a limitation period that they knew had been met by
    litigation they believed to be ongoing.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the expiration of the limitation period is
    irrelevant because once an action is reinstated, it continues as if the
    dismissal never occurred.  It follows
    that any coincidental expiration of a limitation period between the issuance of
    the registrar’s order and the reinstatement of the action cannot inform the
    question of whether the action should be reinstated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I agree with the appeal judge that
    the mere expiry of a limitation period after an action has been commenced does
    not give rise to deemed prejudice.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Deeming prejudice to
    the defendants</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this case, the master “deemed” prejudice to the defendants.  “Deemed </span>prejudice” simply means that
    it is reasonable for the court to draw an inference that the defendant was
    prejudiced by a particular set of circumstances.  Once prejudice to the defendant is “deemed”,
    the evidentiary burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate an absence of
    prejudice.  If the plaintiff meets that
    burden, the evidentiary burden shifts back to the defendant to establish actual
    prejudice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, whether prejudice should be inferred in
    the absence of direct evidence must depend on what is reasonable in light of
    the issues at stake.  For example, it is
    evident that cases involving eyewitness evidence may be prejudiced by delay for
    the well-known reason that memories fade over time.  Similarly, cases involving record-keeping may
    be prejudiced, depending upon the state of the defendant’s documentary
    preservation.  In both instances, it is a
    reasonable inference that the passage of time could prejudice the defendant’s
    ability to have a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, prejudice is inferred in cases
    arising from incidents such as a motor vehicle accident or a slip and fall
    because such cases involve eyewitness or documentary evidence that is
    susceptible to deterioration from the passage of time.  However, prejudice is not a reasonable
    inference in all cases.  In this case,
    the plaintiff sued the police and the state.  All the defendants had early and adequate notice of the particulars of
    the claim in order to undertake any necessary investigations and ensure proper
    memory preservation and record keeping.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master seems to have approached this case by
    concluding that the plaintiffs failed to overcome the inference of prejudice to
    the defendants.  However, the
    circumstances of the case do not lead to an inference of prejudice.  Moreover, the plaintiff provided evidence
    that there was no prejudice and the defendants failed to respond with evidence
    of actual prejudice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff’s direct evidence that there was no
    prejudice went well beyond a mere bald statement.  In his affidavit, counsel for the plaintiff
    stated that the available 14 boxes of disclosure provided by the Crown during
    the criminal proceedings preserved a “complete evidentiary record”.  He also swore that he believed that the
    defendants had “commenced investigations” upon receipt of the plaintiff’s
    claims and had “likely preserved the evidentiary records as well.”  He swore his belief that “absolutely no
    prejudice will befall the defendants”.  This evidence on behalf of the plaintiff stood unchallenged by
    cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite this direct evidence of the absence of
    prejudice, the defendants chose not to address the issue of actual prejudice in
    their material.  Instead, they decided to
    rely solely on deemed prejudice.  In my
    view, they made this decision at their peril.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, the appeal judge was correct in
    concluding the defendants called “no evidence of actual prejudice”.  Moreover, to the extent the master accepted
    the defendants’ arguments of actual <span class=GramE>prejudice,</span> those
    arguments were not supported by evidence.<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master referred to three such arguments in
    concluding that the plaintiff failed to displace prejudice deemed to arise from
    the expiration of the limitation period.  First, the master concluded that there were “witnesses whose evidence
    [would] be germane, notably, the expert in the U.S. whose evidence appears to
    be <span class=GramE>key</span>.”  However, there was no evidence to support this conclusion.  If the expert referenced by the master was
    Dr. Demaio, there was no explanation about the scope of his evidence and
    certainly nothing to suggest that his evidence would have been compromised in
    any way by either the expiration of the limitation period or the passage of
    time.  Nor is there any indication in the
    record of any other witness who would no longer be available as a result of the
    passage of time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the master determined that the civil case would
    “[require] different evidence than that which would be found in the Crown
    disclosure brief.”  The master’s reasons
    do not explain the nature of any “different evidence” and the issue was not
    addressed in the defendants’ responding affidavit or anywhere else in the
    record.  Accordingly, the appeal judge
    was correct when he noted there was no evidence to support this
    conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the master found that deemed prejudice flowed in
    part from the fact that so much time had passed from Mrs. Wellwood’s death in
    1999 and the laying of the charge against the plaintiff until its withdrawal in
    2004.  However, in my view, that passage
    of almost five years cannot be attributed to the plaintiff.  Surely, in the circumstances of this case,
    the police and the state cannot rely on prejudicial delay for the time period
    the plaintiff was facing a murder charge brought against him by the
    defendants.  The plaintiff was powerless
    to control the time taken by the state in advancing his criminal
    prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that the appeal judge was correct in
    concluding that the absence of evidence of actual prejudice to the defendants
    favoured the plaintiff’s motion to reinstate the action.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>3.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Explanation for the
    delay</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her reasons, the master “combined” consideration of
    whether the delays in proceeding with the motions and actions were intentional
    with the question of solicitor’s inadvertence.  The master concluded that the solicitor’s affidavit failed to explain
    adequately the delay in bringing the motion.  She also concluded that the plaintiff failed to provide an explanation
    of steps he took to inquire about the progress of the action.  On this basis, she concluded that the
    plaintiff had not discharged his onus to explain that “the delay was not
    intentional”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The master reached this conclusion even though the
    plaintiff expressly stated in his affidavit that it had “always been and
    continues to be my intention to proceed with this action” and, more
    importantly, that he had instructed his lawyer to move to set aside the
    dismissal order.  This evidence stood
    unchallenged by cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The affidavit of the plaintiff’s litigation lawyer was
    less direct.  It referred to delay caused
    by “re-drafts” of material.  This may
    have been intended to address the issue of solicitor inadvertence, but it did
    not address the issue of the plaintiff’s intention.  Moreover, that was not the only
    evidence.  The defendants’ filed exhibits
    on the motion that included correspondence counsel exchanged between January
    18, 2007 and May 10, 2007.  In that
    correspondence, the plaintiff’s litigation counsel advised the defendants that
    he was reporting the matter to LawPro and that “[t]his explains our
    delay.”  Three months later, new counsel
    for the plaintiff wrote stating that he would bring forward the motions to set
    aside the dismissal.  In response, the
    Crown required “proof” that the new counsel was receiving instructions from the
    plaintiff (rather than from the plaintiff’s former litigation lawyer).  A series of letters followed that ended with
    the delivery of the plaintiff’s affidavit responding to the defendants’
    challenges by expressly stating his intention to proceed with the action and
    the motion.  Thus, several months of the
    delay were explained on the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also apparent from the record that the plaintiff
    is the antithesis of a sophisticated litigant who would instruct counsel to
    delay to gain some tactical advantage or other benefit.  He had no apparent motive to delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, in deciding not to reinstate the action, the
    master acknowledged that “the result may be harsh to the plaintiff”.  She continued, however, to make the observation
    that the plaintiff may “have a remedy against his solicitor”.  This court explained in <i>Finlay</i>, at para. 32, why such a potential remedy is not a relevant
    consideration in determining whether to set aside a dismissal order: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A judge who refuses to set aside a dismissal order
    will naturally be concerned that the effect of the refusal will be to deprive
    an innocent party of its day in court. To protect the claim of the innocent
    party, the judge will often raise the possibility of a negligence action against
    the party's own lawyer. Although perhaps understandable, I do not find this
    helpful. Speculation about whether a party has a lawsuit against its own
    lawyer, or the potential success of that lawsuit, should not inform the court’s
    analysis of whether the registrar’s dismissal order ought to be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In exercising his discretion, the appeal judge was
    alive to the issue of delay in bringing the motion.  After deciding that the master erred in her
    conclusion of prejudice, the appeal judge noted that the absence of an adequate
    explanation weighed “heavily in favour of the defendants.”  Indeed, he observed that, given the “little
    explanation as to why the delay occurred”, the periods of inactivity “may well
    under other circumstances [have tipped] the balance in favour of the dismissal
    of the appeal”.  However, after balancing
    all the other relevant circumstances, including the absence of prejudice, the
    appeal judge concluded that the appeal should be allowed and the action reinstated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was in accordance with <i>Scaini</i>, which requires the court to balance the relevant factors by
    taking a “contextual approach”.  In doing
    so, the appeal judge recognized that the exercise was one of discretion that
    required the balancing of the interests of the parties, as well as the public
    interest in finality in the resolution of disputes.  In particular, the appeal judge pointed to <i>Marché</i> at para. 25 and noted the
    importance of lawyers’ adhering to timelines in order to avoid delay that
    “multiplies costs and breeds frustration and unfairness”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In arriving at his decision, the appeal judge was
    influenced by the early notice of the claim and the absence of prejudice to the
    defendants.  These considerations were an
    appropriate part of the balancing exercise.  As J. I. Laskin J.A. stated at para. 28 of <i>Finlay</i>, prejudice <span class=GramE>is</span> “invariably... a key
    consideration on a motion to set aside a dismissal order.”  See also <i>Farrar
    v. McMullan</i> (1971), 1 O.R. 709 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, after taking into account the relevant
    circumstances, the appeal judge was entitled to conclude that “the ultimate
    balancing of all the factors favours the plaintiff.”    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Result</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with the result
    that the action would be reinstated.  I
    would award costs of the appeal to the respondent.</p>
