style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following a trial on a 17-count indictment, the
    appellant was convicted of assault causing bodily harm in respect of an
    incident involving his wife, K.B. (Count Four) and further, of disobeying a
    lawful court order to have no contact directly or indirectly with K.B. (Count
    17).  He was acquitted of all remaining
    charges.  On sentencing, he was declared
    a dangerous offender and an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment was
    imposed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals, arguing that his
    convictions are unreasonable.  He also
    seeks leave to appeal sentence and, if leave be granted, appeals against
    sentence, maintaining that he should have been declared a long-term rather than
    a dangerous offender.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss
    both the conviction and sentence appeals.</p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>A.        Conviction
    Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of his conviction appeal, the
    appellant contends that the evidence relating to Counts One and Four was so
    intertwined and interrelated that no separate assessment of the appellant’s
    culpability on Count Four (the assault causing bodily harm charge) could
    reasonably have been undertaken by the jury in isolation from the evidence
    relating to Count One.  The appellant
    says that as he was acquitted of Count One, the conviction on Count Four is
    therefore unreasonable and cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  Unlike the evidence in respect of the other counts, there was
    corroborative evidence at trial of the complainant’s version of the incident
    forming the subject matter of Count Four, in the form of medical reports and
    photographs that confirmed the injuries sustained by her.  Moreover, the appellant conceded that he had
    engaged in a scuffle with the complainant that could have accounted for the
    complainant’s injuries, but provided an innocent explanation for those
    injuries.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Count Four was left with the jury on this basis
    (namely, that the evidence in relation to Count Four set it apart from the
    other counts against the appellant), without objection by the defence.  The trial judge carefully instructed the jury
    on the governing principles in <i>R. v. W<span
class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> and cautioned the jury that the evidence in
    respect of each count was to be assessed separately from the evidence relating
    to the other counts.  By its verdict on
    Count Four, the jury clearly rejected the appellant’s account of the cause of
    the complainant’s injuries, concluded that it did not raise a reasonable doubt,
    and accepted the complainant’s testimony on this issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the features of Count Four set out
    in paragraph five above distinguish it from the circumstances surrounding Count
    One.  Accordingly, the verdicts on these
    two counts can stand together.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant makes a similar argument of
    unreasonable verdict in respect of Count Six (unlawful confinement) and Count Four.  We also reject this argument.  As with Count One, and in contrast to Count Four,
    there was no confirmatory evidence regarding Count Six.  Moreover, Counts Four and Six involve
    entirely different offences with different component elements.  In this case, it was clearly open to the jury
    to find that the appellant assaulted K.B., without having to also find that she
    was unlawfully confined.  There is
    therefore no inconsistency in the jury’s verdicts on these counts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We note that the appellant did not pursue his
    appeal against conviction in respect of Count 17.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal from conviction is therefore
    dismissed.</p>
  <h2>B.        Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant raised various grounds of appeal
    in his factum on his sentence appeal.  However, the focus of his oral submissions before this court was
    whether, in finding that there was no reasonable possibility of eventual
    control of the risk posed by the appellant in the community, the trial judge
    erred by relying on the Crown’s expert evidence, which was premised in part on
    consideration of the circumstances surrounding counts on which the appellant
    was acquitted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept this ground of appeal.  The trial judge made it clear in his reasons
    that, in fashioning an appropriate sentence, he disregarded those other counts
    and the evidence relating to them.  Further, he recognized that it was incumbent on him not merely to rubber
    stamp the opinions expressed by the experts but, rather, to carefully review
    their evidence.  This is precisely what
    he did.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, and importantly, the Crown’s leading
    expert expressly confirmed that his opinion of the uncontrollable high risk
    posed by the appellant would not have changed in any way if he had removed from
    consideration the information relating to the appellant’s other alleged abusive
    conduct in respect of which the appellant was acquitted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, the trial judge concluded that the
    evidence did not establish more than an expression of hope or remote
    possibility that the appellant’s risk could be controlled in the
    community.  In arriving at this conclusion,
    the trial judge carefully considered the whole of the evidence and correctly
    applied the controlling legal principles.  On this record, his sentencing disposition was both eminently reasonable
    and fully justified.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the
    sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
