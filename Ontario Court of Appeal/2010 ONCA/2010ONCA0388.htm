  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ARMSTRONG J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Laura Ouderkirk, attended a bonfire
    party at the property of the respondent, Ronald Clarry, on May 11, 2002 in
    Sunderland, Ontario.  Shortly after
    arriving at the party, she fell from a deck at the rear of the respondent’s
    house and suffered a broken ankle and related injuries.  She sued the respondent in negligence for her
    injuries.  After a 10-day jury trial
    before Justice Ruth Mesbur of the Superior Court of Justice and a jury, the
    appellant’s action for damages was dismissed.  The appellant now appeals the dismissal of her action.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        The
    Accident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent and a friend built a deck at the rear of
    the respondent’s house located on a 143 acre property in Sunderland,
    Ontario.  The deck consisted of a flat
    surface that was 31 inches above the ground.  The respondent did not obtain a building permit and the deck did not
    comply with the Ontario Building Code.  In particular, the deck did not have a railing, which the building code
    required for any deck over 23 and 5/8 inches high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The deck was completed in the afternoon of May 11,
    2002.  A bonfire party at the property
    was planned for that evening.  The
    respondent called his friend, the appellant, and invited her to attend the
    party.  The respondent and another friend
    went to the appellant’s house to pick her up and take her to the party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that after arriving at the
    respondent’s house, he suggested she grab two beers for them and check out the
    new deck before meeting the other guests at the site of the bonfire.  The appellant walked out to the deck.  In cross-examination, she said it was dusk
    and she could see the edge of the deck.  She proceeded to step off the edge of the deck where she expected to
    meet a step or the ground.  Unfortunately, she fell to the ground and fractured her ankle and
    injured her lower back.  She testified
    that she was given no warning about a drop from the deck to the ground and that
    there was no safety railing at the edge of the deck.  She saw no stairs from the deck to the
    ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent had a slightly different version of
    events.  When they arrived at the
    respondent’s house, he said that the appellant took two bottles of beer from
    the refrigerator and made her way through the sliding door to the deck.  The respondent testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I said to Laurie - - I said, “Grab a couple beer
    for us, and, uh, we’ll go out to the bonfire.”  I said, in the meantime, “<span class=GramE>check</span> out my
    deck.  It’s just the base I finished, and
    I said be careful, there’s no railing.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the respondent was examined for discovery five years
    before trial, he did not refer to his having warned the appellant about the
    lack of a railing.  On July 14, 2003, (a
    little more than a year after the accident), he testified on discovery as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I said to Laurie - - I said, “Grab a couple beer
    and we’ll go out to see the tenants at the bonfire.”  I said, in the meantime, “<span class=GramE>check</span> out my deck”.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>He also testified on discovery that there were no stairs for
    the deck at the time of the party.  However, at trial, he said that he had installed a set of temporary
    stairs prior to the party, which he intended to replace with more permanent
    stairs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s daughter, Rhonda Clarry, testified
    that she heard her father tell the appellant to go and look at the deck, to be
    careful because there was no railing and to use the stairs.  She also testified that she gave the
    appellant the same warning and told her to use the stairs.  In 2005, Rhonda Clarry gave a statement to
    the respondent’s lawyer concerning her potential evidence.  She did not mention in that statement that
    there were stairs in place at the time of the accident, nor did she say that
    her father told the appellant to use the stairs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was an issue at trial as to whether, at the time
    of the accident, there were any stairs attached to the deck.  The appellant said she saw no stairs.  The respondent’s daughter and several others
    who attended the party testified that the temporary stairs were installed and
    attached to the deck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was also an issue as to the lighting of the
    deck.  The appellant said the grass
    looked dark.  The respondent and others
    who testified said that there was ample lighting on the deck provided by a
    floodlight on the back of the garage, lighting from inside the house and light
    from the bonfire, which was about 20 to 25 feet from the deck and which lit up
    the whole side of the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent installed a temporary safety railing on
    the deck some months after the accident for his annual pig roast in the second
    week of September 2002.  In
    cross-examination, he agreed the deck was not safe without a railing when he
    was going to have 80 to 120 people at the pig roast.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       The Appellant’s Injuries</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was taken to hospital by ambulance.  Her distal tibia and fibula were broken in
    several places.  Treatment involved
    surgery and the insertion of two plates and 17 screws to stabilize the
    fractured bones.  The appellant was in a
    cast for four months.  There was a second
    surgery to remove the hardware.  The
    evidence from two orthopaedic surgeons was that there was a 10 to 15 per cent
    risk of post-traumatic arthritis.  At the
    time of the trial (six years after the accident), the appellant still had
    soreness in her ankle and back pain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two weeks after the accident, the appellant attempted
    suicide.  She attributed the attempt to
    substantial pain and immobility, which exacerbated pre-existing depression
    related to the death of her only child, which occurred prior to the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant returned to full-time work in January
    2003. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     The Jury’s Verdict </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury’s verdict on liability was contained in the
    answers to the following questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did Ronald Clarry fail to take reasonable care in all
    the circumstances to ensure that Laura Ouderkirk was reasonably safe while on
    Mr. Clarry’s premises on May 11, 2002?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If your answer to question 1 is “yes”, please provide
    particulars:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>         Not answered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)    Did Ms.
    Ouderkirk fail to take reasonable care for her own safety on May 11, 2002?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.     Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)    If your answer
    to question 3 is “yes”, please provide the particulars:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We would expect that
    reasonable care would involve paying close attention to one’s footing in an
    unfamiliar environment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury assessed the appellant’s general damages for
    pain and suffering at $30,000.  The jury found
    that 50 per cent of the appellant’s lost income of $20,363.00 and two-thirds of
    the appellant’s out-of-pocket expenses of $660.00 were caused by her injuries.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)     the jury’s verdict on liability is
    perverse;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)    the
    jury’s verdict on damages is perverse; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span class=GramE>the</span> trial judge
    erred in admitting three defence photo-graphs of the deck taken a few days
    before trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for setting aside a jury’s verdict was
    succinctly articulated by Chief Justice Duff some 73 years ago in <i>McCannell v. McLean</i>, [1937] S.C.R. 341
    at 343:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principle has been laid down in many judgments
    of this Court to this effect, that the verdict of a jury will not be set aside
    as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust
    as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and
    acting judicially could have reached it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In defining the test, Chief Justice Duff also referred
    to the cautionary language of Lord Wright in <i>Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd.</i> <i>and</i> <i>Lehwess v. Austin</i> [1935] A.C. 346 (H.L.) at 375:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lord Halsbury in these valuable observations is, I
    think, going back to the test applied in Wood v. Gunston (1655) Style, 466),
    which was whether there was a miscarriage of the jury.  Thus the question in truth is not whether the
    verdict appears to the appellate court to be right, but whether it is such as
    to show that the jury have failed to perform their duty.  An appellate Court must always be on guard
    against the tendency to set aside a verdict because the Court feels it would
    have come to a different conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More recently, my colleague, Feldman J.A., cited Chief
    Justice Duff’s test in <i>McCannell</i> and
    observed: “Consequently, it is relatively rare for a jury verdict in a civil
    case to be overturned on appeal”.  See <i>Bovingdon v. Hergott</i> (2008), 88 O.R.
    (3d) 641 at 649.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Kerr v.
    Loblaws Inc.</i> (2007), 224 O.A.C. 56 at para. 53, Cronk J.A., writing for the
    court, concluded that since “there was an evidentiary base to support the
    jury’s verdict on liability”, she could not conclude that “the jury’s verdict
    on liability is either plainly unreasonable or unjust”.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Is the jury’s verdict on liability
    perverse?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the jury’s
    verdict is perverse in light of the uncontroverted evidence that the respondent
    built a deck without a building permit and without a railing in contravention
    of the Ontario Building Code.  Counsel
    further submits that the evidence clearly established that the deck was unsafe
    by reason of the failure of the respondent to install the required railing,
    which was the cause of the appellant’s fall and resulting injuries.  For the jury to conclude that the respondent
    did not fail to take care to insure that the appellant was reasonably safe
    while on his premises is a perverse conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant also argues that the verdict
    is perverse because the jury’s answers to the questions are vague and indicate
    a failure to follow the trial judge’s instructions.  Counsel points out that the trial judge told
    the jury that if their answer to question 1 was “no”, <i>i.e.</i> that the respondent did take reasonable care in the
    circumstances, <span class=GramE>then</span> there would be no need to answer
    any other question on liability.  The
    jury did not follow that instruction since they went on to answer the third and
    fourth questions concerning the appellant’s failure to take reasonable care for
    her own safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept the submissions of the appellant.  I do agree that absent the evidence of the
    respondent and his daughter, that he expressly warned the appellant as she went
    out to the deck to be careful as there was no <span class=GramE>railing,</span> this was a strong case for the appellant.  The respondent and his daughter were challenged on that evidence.  The respondent’s evidence on discovery, which
    did not refer to the warning, was highlighted on cross-examination.  Similarly, the daughter’s failure to refer to
    the warning in her statement to the lawyer was highlighted on cross-examination.  The jury might have disbelieved the
    respondent or at least might not have been persuaded on a balance of
    probabilities that he warned the appellant.  However, it appears that the jury was satisfied on a balance of
    probabilities that the warning was given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was evidence that supported the position of the
    respondent that he did not fail to take reasonable measures to ensure the
    appellant’s safety:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there was lighting, which reached the deck from the
    inside of the house, the back of the garage and the bonfire which was about 20
    to 25 feet from the deck;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the respondent had installed a temporary set of stairs
    to allow for access to and from the deck prior to the party; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>the</span> appellant was warned that
    there was no railing on the deck and to be careful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s case was also assisted by the following
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant was told by the respondent’s daughter to
    use the stairs which were plainly visible; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant admitted seeing the edge of the deck and
    being aware of the lack of a railing; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>the</span> appellant told Rhonda
    Clarry and another witness right after her fall that she felt really stupid and
    that the accident was her fault.  She
    made a similar statement to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the jury must have accepted the evidence of
    the respondent in respect of the crucial issue of the warning, which provided a
    basis with the other defence evidence for the jury to answer the first question
    in the affirmative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that there were credibility issues
    concerning the evidence of the appellant.  She appears to have exaggerated the effect of her injuries on her
    mobility.  She told a doctor for the
    defence that she used a wheelchair for four months while her treating surgeon
    testified that she was able to use crutches on her discharge from the hospital
    two weeks after the accident.  He also testified
    that her injured leg was capable of full weight bearing after two months.  In reply evidence, the appellant testified
    that she used the wheelchair to carry a hot water bottle of tea but otherwise
    used her crutches.  The appellant also
    applied to extend her disability insurance coverage on January 8, 2003 at a
    time when she was already working full-time.  It was open to the jury to take these credibility issues into
    consideration when considering her evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the jury’s answer to the questions on
    liability.  I do not find the answers to
    these questions to be vague such that they lead to a conclusion that the
    verdict is perverse.  While the jury did
    not follow the trial judge’s instructions concerning questions 3 and 4 on
    contributory negligence, there is nothing in the answers that conflicts with
    the answer to question 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the above reasons, I cannot conclude that the
    jury’s verdict on liability is perverse.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       Is the jury’s verdict on damages perverse?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submitted to the jury that
    the appropriate range for general damages was $60,000 to $90,000.  The range submitted by counsel for the
    appellant was based on the appellant’s significant ankle fracture that included
    two surgeries, a four-month recovery period, physiotherapy, ongoing pain and a
    future risk of arthritis.  Counsel also
    submits that the jury perversely ignored the appellant’s pre-existing
    depression, which was exacerbated by the accident and resulted in a suicide
    attempt.  Counsel submits to this court
    that $30,000 general damages is inordinately low and beyond the range of what
    is reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent submitted that the appropriate
    range for general damages was $30,000 to $40,000.  Counsel for the respondent submits that the
    medical records establish that the appellant suffered an ankle fracture that
    healed without complication and allowed her to return to her pre-accident
    activities within a few months.  He
    submits to this court that the assessment of $30,000 is consistent with the assessment
    of damages for similar injuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, in her charge to the jury on general
    damages, instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you are satisfied that the loss claimed by the
    plaintiff has been proven as described by counsel for the plaintiff, then I
    would suggest that you might see fit to award damages in the lower end of his
    range.  He described Ms. Ouderkirk’s
    injuries to you as a reasonably severe ankle injury, minor aggravation of her
    back, and major aggravation of her depression, preventing her from returning to
    work.  He suggested her inability to
    manage the pain from the break was the reason she attempted suicide in the
    weeks following the accident.  She points
    to the fact that she is a single woman and has scarring on her leg.  He also says that she has, and will continue
    to have, ankle pain, and the possibility of developing posttraumatic
    osteoarthritis.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the other hand, if you are satisfied that the
    only losses the plaintiff has suffered are what the defendant’s counsel has
    told you, then I suggest that you may see fit to award damages in the range
    that he suggested to you.  He suggested
    that Ms. Ouderkirk’s injuries were nothing out of the ordinary for an injury of
    this <span class=GramE>kind, that</span> her use of Oxycocet was not necessary
    for her pain, and she should not have required it.  He suggested to you that the six to eight
    weeks she spent in a cast were typical for this kind of injury, hardware
    removal is also typical, and her risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis is now
    only about five percent.  In that regard,
    he suggests that even if she does develop arthritis, there is only a five
    percent chance that she would require surgery to correct it.  He says she is doing well, and does not
    suffer continuing pain.  He says that you
    should not believe her continued Oxycocet use is because of pain from the ankle
    injury.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is up to you to assess Ms. Ouderkirk’s pain and
    suffering, both in the past, currently, and what she may suffer in the future
    in arriving at your figure for general damages.  You should not, though, simply take the range of damages suggested by
    either counsel for the plaintiff or counsel for the defendant, or even my own
    range, and divide it in two.  If you did
    that, you would certainly not be acting judicially.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No objection was made in respect of the above
    instruction.  It is apparent that the
    jury rejected the evidence that supported the appellant’s position, and
    preferred the evidence that supported the respondent’s position.  This they were entitled to do.  I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pecuniary damages are also in issue on this
    appeal.  At trial, counsel for both
    parties agreed that the total lost earnings of the appellant were $20,363 and
    the total out-of-pocket expenses were $660.  However, counsel could not agree on whether 100 per cent of the losses were
    attributable to the injuries the appellant suffered as a result of the
    accident.  The respondent argued that the
    losses were caused by the appellant’s pre-existing conditions.  The trial judge advised the jury to decide
    whether all of the losses, some of the losses or none of the losses resulted
    from the accident.  She invited the jury
    to provide percentage figures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury decided that 50 per cent of the lost income
    and two-thirds of the out-of-pocket expenses were losses incurred as a result
    of the accident.  The jury appears to
    have done what they were instructed to do and I see no basis to interfere with
    the verdict on pecuniary damages.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(iii)     Did the trial judge err in admitting three defence photographs of
    the deck taken a few days before trial?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The photographs in issue show the deck with a permanent
    railing around it and stairs at each end.  The photographs were taken in May 2008, six years after the accident and
    just before trial.  There is no issue
    that, at the time of the accident, there was no railing on the deck.  The photographs apparently were tendered to
    address the issue of whether there were stairs installed at the time of the
    accident.  The trial judge ruled that the
    photographs were admissible but that counsel for the plaintiff (the appellant)
    would be allowed “extremely broad leeway in cross-examination on the issue of
    the stairs”.  Other photographs taken by
    the appellant a few weeks after the accident did not show any stairs attached
    to the deck but they also did not show the ends of the deck, where the stairs
    were said to be located.  The respondent
    testified that one of the sets of stairs shown in the photographs is the same
    set that was in place on the night of the party.  He explained his testimony on discovery
    concerning the lack of stairs.  He
    explained that the stairs, which he took from the clothesline, had been
    installed as temporary stairs that he intended to replace with a new permanent
    set.  His intention on discovery was to
    say that he had not built new stairs for the deck at the time of the
    party.  The jury was carefully instructed
    on the issue of the stairs and the conclusions they could draw from the
    photographs.  I am not persuaded that
    the trial judge erred in her ruling as to the admissibility of the photographs.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  If the parties cannot agree on costs, then we
    will receive written submissions from the respondent not to exceed 3 pages
    double spaced within 10 days of the release of these reasons.  The appellant may then respond within 7 days
    of the receipt of the respondent’s submissions – not to exceed 3 pages double
    spaced.</p>
