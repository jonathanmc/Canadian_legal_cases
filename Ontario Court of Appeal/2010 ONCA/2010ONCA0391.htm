  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This litigation involves consideration of two
    directors’ and officers’ insurance policies in relation to responsibility for
    the payment of defence costs. The issue on appeal is a narrow one – whether the
    “follow form” clause contained in the Lloyd’s policy applies to the duty to
    defend in that same policy.  The parties
    are agreed that if it does apply, Lloyds has no duty to defend and the AIG
    policy is primary in relation to defence costs.  If however, the “follow form” clause does not apply to the duty to
    defend then the Lloyd’s policy provides a duty to defend and is primary in
    relation to defence costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that the follow form
    clause did not apply to the duty to defend and that therefore the Lloyd’s
    policy was primary for the defence costs at issue.  For the reasons that follow, 1 <span
class=GramE>agree</span> with the application judge. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts are not in dispute.  Goodman and Reeve, two lawyers at Cassels
    Brock, were sued in their capacity as directors of Markham General Insurance
    Company.  Both Cassels Brock and Markham
    General have policies of insurance that cover directors’ and officers’
    liability.  Markham General has a
    directors’ and officers’ liability policy issued by AIG and American Home.  Cassels Brock has an outside directorship
    liability policy issued by a Lloyd’s syndicate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lawyers brought an application to determine which
    of the two insurers was required to pay their defence costs.  At the time of their application, the claim
    had settled – payment having been made by AIG – and their defence costs paid by
    their law firm.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      The AIG
    Policy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The declaration page of the AIG policy contains the
    following notice:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>NOTICE:  THE
    INSURER DOES NOT ASSUME ANY DUTY TO DEFEND.  HOWEVER THE INSUREDS MAY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS TENDER THE DEFENCE OF
    A CLAIM.  IN ALL EVENTS, THE INSURER MUST
    ADVANCE DEFENCE COSTS PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS HEREIN PRIOR TO THE FINAL
    DISPOSITION OF A CLAIM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The insuring agreements of that policy provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Insurer does not assume any duty to defend …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence costs, settlements, judgments (including
    the advancement of defence costs) part of the policy provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Insurer does not assume any duty to
    defend.  The <span class=SpellE>Insureds</span> shall defend and contest any Claim made against them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are provisions in the AIG policy whereby an
    insured may in some circumstances tender the defence of a claim to the insurer
    but those provisions have no application to the present appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, under the heading “Other Insurance and
    Indemnification”, the AIG policy states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Such insurance as is provided by this policy shall
    apply only as excess over any other valid and collectible insurance.  This policy specifically shall be excess of
    any other policy pursuant to which any other insurer has a duty to defend a Claim
    for which this policy may be obligated to pay Loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Goodman and Reeve separately retained counsel who
    represented them through the conclusion of the lawsuit against them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The AIG policy had limits of $10,000,000 and the
    Lloyd’s policy had limits of $5,000,000. The suit against the two lawyers and
    other directors claimed damages of $40,000,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.</span><span>      </span><span class=GramE>The</span> Lloyd<span
lang=EN-US>’s Policy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two distinct insuring agreements in the
    Lloyd’s policy: the first – IA. <span class=GramE>–  where</span> there is no underlying insurance
    and the second – IB. –  where there
    is.  It is only the latter provision
    which is relevant to this appeal and it provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>B.        If
    there is Underlying Insurance arranged for the benefit of the Directors and
    Officers of the Corporation, the Insurer shall pay on behalf of the Named
    Insured who serves in Outside Directorships all Loss resulting from any Claim
    first made during the Policy Period for a Wrongful Act for which the Named
    Insured is not indemnified by the Corporation excess of the greater of such Underlying
    Insurance or the amount set forth in Item 10 of the Declarations and excess of
    the Deductible as set forth in Item 6 of the Declarations and subject to the
    Limit of Liability as set forth in Item 5 of the Declarations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is accepted by the parties that the definition of
    “Loss” under the Lloyd’s policy includes defence costs.  Clause IB. goes on to state:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>With
    respect to Insuring Agreement B, </i>this policy is subject to and shall follow
    all terms, conditions, exclusions, agreements, limitations and endorsements of
    the Underlying Insurance in all respects except for the Limits of Liability.  However, the terms, conditions, exclusions,
    agreements, limitations and endorsements of this policy shall apply if they are
    more restrictive than those of the Underlying Insurance.  Coverage hereunder will attach only after all
    of the Underlying Insurance has been exhausted by payments for Losses.  In no event shall coverage under this policy
    be broader than coverage under any Underlying Insurance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>This is the follow form clause
    which is in issue in the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “Defence” section of the Lloyd’s policy provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to Wrongful Acts insured by this
    policy:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>If defence of the
    Named Insured is not provided by the Corporation or any Underlying Insurance,
    the Insurer shall defend any Claim against the Named Insured </i>even if such Claim
    is groundless, false or fraudulent, but the Insurer may make such
    investigation, negotiation and settlement of any Claim as they deem
    expedient.  The Insurer shall not be
    obligated to pay any Claim or judgment or to defend any Claim after the
    aggregate limit of the Insurer’s liability has been exhausted by payment of
    loss.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE>and</span> under
    OTHER INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the Corporation maintains Underlying Insurance
    and a Claim otherwise covered by this policy is first made against any Named
    Insured, then with respect to such Claim this policy shall be specifically
    excess of the amount of payment from such Underlying Insurance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Under
    Insuring Agreement I.B, a minimum Underlying Insurance limit of CAN $5,000,000
    shall apply to Corporations Publicly Traded in Canada and CAN $10,000,000 shall
    apply to Corporations Publicly Traded in the United States as set forth in Item
    10 of the Declarations and such limit or limits shall be maintained in full
    force and effect during the currency of this policy, except for any reduction
    in the aggregate limit or limits contained therein solely by payment of Claims
    in respect of Claims made during the period of this policy.  Failure of the Named Insured to comply with
    the foregoing shall not invalidate this policy, but in the event of such
    failure, the obligations of the Insurer under this policy shall be interpreted
    as if the minimum Underlying Insurance limit was in place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If any Loss arising from any Claim made against any
    Named Insured is insured under any other valid policy(ies), prior or current,
    then this policy shall cover such Loss, subject to its limitations, conditions,
    provisions and other terms, only to the extent that the amount of such Loss is
    in excess of the amount of payment from such other insurance, whether such
    other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or
    otherwise, unless such other insurance is written only as specific excess
    insurance over the Limits of Liability provided by this policy.</p>
  <p><b>V.      Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The duty to defend is separate from the duty to
    indemnify: see <i>Nicholls v. American Home</i>,
    [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801.  While a duty to
    defend will arise where a claim is made that may possibly fall within cover,
    indemnity is only required when a claim is proved to fall within cover.  They are separate and distinct aspects of
    coverage and are dealt with separately in the Lloyd’s policy.  It is undisputed that the AIG policy does not
    provide a duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The insuring agreements of the Lloyd’s policy deal with
    indemnity.  There are two insuring
    agreements: A. and B.  A. deals with the
    situation where there is no underlying insurance and is not relevant for
    present purposes.  Insuring agreement B.,
    which applies where there is underlying insurance, is the relevant clause for
    present purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The follow form clause contained in the Lloyd’s policy,
    set out above, is part and parcel of insuring agreement B.  Its opening words make it clear that it only
    applies to insuring agreement B.:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to Insuring Agreement B, this policy
    is subject to and shall follow all terms etc. of the Underlying Insurance in
    all respects except for the Limits of Liability …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the effect of this clause is
    to convert the duty to defend contained in its policy to a duty to pay defence
    costs only, which is a term of the AIG policy.  The application judge disagreed and in my view she was correct to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the language of the Lloyd’s policy clearly
    references only insuring agreement B. – where the Lloyd’s policy is to follow
    the terms of the underlying AIG policy.   Insuring agreement B. deals only with
    indemnity and not the duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no similar follow form language in the Defence
    section of the Lloyd’s policy, where the duty to defend is set <span
class=GramE>out, nor</span> in the declarations or general provisions of the
    policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, if the appellant’s position is correct, it
    would render the duty to defend clause meaningless in situations where there is
    underlying insurance.  The duty to
    defend, by the policy terms under clause <span class=GramE>II.A.,</span> arises
    where there is no duty to defend in the underlying insurance.  If the follow form clause applied to convert
    the duty to defend to a duty to pay defence costs only when there is no duty to
    defend in the underlying policy, there would rarely be an occasion where the
    duty to defend would arise. This, in turn, would render section II.A. <span
class=GramE>of</span> the policy virtually meaningless in this respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is clear on the plain language of this
    policy that the follow form provision relates to indemnity coverage and has
    nothing whatever to do with the duty to defend.  The limiting words “with respect to insuring agreement B …” make that
    abundantly clear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no issue here as to which layers of coverage
    the policies in issue are intended to provide.  By their language, the AIG policy is clearly primary while the Lloyd’s
    policy is equally clearly excess insurance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The duty to defend coverage in the Lloyd’s policy is
    what is referred to as “drop down” coverage.  Where there is no cover in the underlying insurance, the excess policy
    may provide cover to fill that gap.  This
    only makes sense: where there is no underlying insurance or no duty to defend
    in the underlying policy, an excess insurer may well want to control or at
    least be represented in any litigation.  That does not convert the excess policy to a primary policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore agree with the application judge’s
    conclusion that the follow form clause does <i>not</i> convert the duty to defend in the Lloyd’s policy to a clause requiring only the
    reimbursement of defence costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that the appellant, supported by the lawyers,
    argued that this result is not in accordance with their mutual subjective expectations;
    however, those expectations are not dispositive. It remains for the court to
    interpret the policy in a reasonably commercial way and in a manner that gives
    meaning to all its terms and provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further in my view, this interpretive conclusion is
    reinforced if one considers clauses II.B. <span class=GramE>and</span> II.D. <span
class=GramE>of</span> the Lloyd’s policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause II.B. provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If defence of the Named Insured is provided by the
    Corporation or any Underlying Insurance, the insurer shall not be called upon
    to investigate, settle or defend any Claims made, or suits brought, or
    proceedings instituted against the Named Insured, but shall have the right and
    be given the opportunity to be associated in the defence and trial of any such Claims,
    suits or proceedings relative to any occurrence which, in the opinion of the
    Insurer, may create a potential liability on the part of the Insurer under the
    terms of this policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If, as the appellant argues, its policy “follows form”
    of the underlying insurance in all respects, one must query the meaning of this
    clause which seems to suggest that where an underlying policy contains a duty
    to defend clause, the appellant has no duty to defend under its policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the appellant’s argument, under this scenario –
    where the underlying policy has a duty to defend – the “follow form” provision
    would cause the Lloyd’s policy to also have a duty to defend.  That is <i>not</i>,
    however, what clause II.B. <span class=GramE>says</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, if one examines clause II.D. <span
class=GramE>of</span> the Lloyd’s policy, a similar argument can be made.  Clause II.D. states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the <b>Named
    Insured </b>refuses to consent to any settlement or compromise recommended by
    the Insurer or by any other insurer who provides <b>Underlying Insurance </b>and which settlement or compromise is
    acceptable to the claimant and the <b>Named
    Insured </b>elects to contest the <b>Claim</b>,
    the Insurer’s liability for <b>Loss</b>,
    including <b>Defence Costs</b>, shall not
    exceed the lesser of either:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         the amount for which the <b>Claim </b>could have been settled, less the
    remaining deductible, plus the <b>Defence
    Costs</b> incurred up to the time of such refusal; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         <span
class=GramE>the</span> applicable Limit of Liability.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Insurer shall have the right to withdraw from
    the further defence thereof by tendering control of said defence to the <b>Named Insured</b>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the Lloyd’s policy were simply to follow the form of
    the underlying insurance in its entirety there would be no need for these
    provisions, which contradict the follow form argument.  There would be no purpose for these terms and
    conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although not strictly relevant to the narrow issue on
    appeal, I do not wish to be taken as endorsing the application judge’s finding
    at paragraph 51 of her reasons, where she noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While the point was not argued before me, it
    appears that under the Lloyd’s policy costs incurred by the insurer pursuant to
    its duty to defend do not erode coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this observation is incorrect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>NOTICE: This is a claims-made policy. … <span
class=GramE>the</span> Limit of Liability available to pay damages shall be
    reduced and may be completely exhausted by payment of Defence Costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And “defence costs” are defined in the policy as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>‘Defence Costs’ means reasonable and necessary costs,
    charges, fees and expenses (other than regular or overtime wages, salaries or
    fees of the Directors, Officers or employees of the Corporation) incurred in
    defending, investigating or monitoring Claims and the premium for appeal,
    attachment or similar bonds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Lloyd’s and AIG policies both provide
    that the limits of liability under the policies will be eroded by defence
    costs.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>VI.      Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs to the respondents AIG and American Home fixed in
    the sum of $6000.00 and to the respondents Goodman and Reeve also fixed in the
    sum of $6000.00.  These amounts are
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
