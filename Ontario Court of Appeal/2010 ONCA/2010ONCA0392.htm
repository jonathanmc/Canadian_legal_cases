  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tribute Resources Inc. (“Tribute”) appeals from the
    dismissal of its application to declare valid two leases: an Oil and Gas Lease
    and a Gas Storage Lease.  The same
    judgment granted the respondent, McKinley Farms Ltd. (“McKinley”), declarations
    that these leases were terminated.  At
    issue in this appeal is the validity of the two leases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal
    in part.  I would find the Oil and Gas
    Lease is valid and subsisting, but that the Gas Storage Lease terminated.</p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;text-transform:uppercase'>Facts</span></b></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tribute, through its predecessor, executed an Oil and
    Gas Lease with the predecessor of McKinley Farms Inc. (“McKinley”) on October
    12, 1977, by which McKinley leased certain oil and gas rights to Tribute for
    annual rental payments.  The term of the
    Oil and Gas Lease was “ten years and so long thereafter as oil or <span
class=GramE>gas are</span> produced in paying quantities, or storage operations
    are being conducted”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Oil and Gas Lease was amended by a Unit Operating
    Agreement dated October 30, 1984.  Paragraph three of the Unit Operating Agreement dealt with payments to
    be made by Tribute to McKinley “in lieu of all payments under the said lease”.  One of the payments required to be made or
    tendered was an annual rental payment of $2.50 for every acre of the lands
    retained by Tribute.  Section 3(b) of the
    Unit Operating Agreement provided, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And as long as the payments in this clause provided are made or
    tendered, operations for the production of the leased substances from the unit
    area shall be deemed to be conducted by the lessee on the said lands under the
    said lease, and the said lease as hereby amended shall remain in full force and
    effect as to all of the said lands retained by the lessee under the said lease
    and/or this agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of July 31st, 2001, gas was no longer produced in
    paying quantities.  Tribute continued to
    pay McKinley the annual rental payments pursuant to the Unit Operating
    Agreement, some of which were tendered and accepted late.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties entered into a Gas Storage Lease Agreement
    dated September 24, 1998.  Under this
    lease, which is subject to the (amended) Oil and Gas Lease, Tribute leased
    certain of McKinley’s land for the purpose of constructing and operating a gas
    storage facility.  The term of the Gas
    Storage Lease was 10 years.  Schedule B
    of this lease provided that “all provisions of the schedule shall be additional
    and shall be paramount with any of the terms in the original agreement”.  One term in Schedule B stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This Gas Storage Lease Agreement shall terminate on the tenth
    anniversary date, if and only if, the lessee or some other person has not
    applied to the Ontario Energy Board to have the said lands or any part thereof
    designated as a gas storage area on or before the tenth anniversary date
    hereof.<a name=Document1zzSDUNumber2></a></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No application was made to the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”)
    before the tenth anniversary of the lease on September 24, 2008.  However, in August 2008 Tribute had delivered
    to McKinley a cheque for the gas storage rental for the period of September 24,
    2008 to September 23, 2009.  Though the
    cheque was dated September 19, McKinley was able to deposit it to its account
    on August 25, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2008, Tribute asked McKinley to enter into a
    Gas Storage Lease Amendment which would allow Tribute an additional year, until
    September 24, 2009, to make an application to the OEB to designate the lands as
    a gas storage area.  McKinley sought
    legal advice.  Eventually, McKinley, by a
    letter from its lawyer dated December 9, 2008, declined to execute the Gas
    Storage Lease Amendment, took the position that the Gas Storage Lease had
    terminated on September 24, 2008, returned the rental payment for the ensuing
    year, and invited an offer “for a fair market value lump-sum payment to reflect
    the value of acquiring control of the reservoir”.  It also took the position that the Oil and
    Gas Lease had terminated in 2001 when oil or gas were no longer produced in
    paying quantities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tribute applied to the court pursuant to rule 14.05 of
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, seeking declarations that the two leases each remained valid
    and McKinley applied for declarations that each of the leases had
    terminated.  </p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;text-transform:
uppercase'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;text-transform:uppercase'>The applications judge’s
    decision</span></b></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge first considered the Oil and Gas
    Lease by itself.  The Oil and Gas Lease’s
    term of 10 years would be extended so long as oil and gas were being produced
    in paying quantities.  He found that when
    production in paying quantities ceased in 2001 and the “well ran dry”, the Oil
    and Gas Lease terminated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge then considered whether this
    result was affected by s. 3(b) of the Unit Operating Agreement, which I have
    quoted above.  He observed first that s.
    3 dealt with “payments” under the original lease, and did not purport to amend
    the term of the lease.  He described it
    as “camouflaged under a section one would expect dealt solely with compensation”.  Second, he observed, that s. 3 (b) refers
    only to “deemed production” and not “deemed production ‘in paying quantities’”.   As both the Oil and Gas Lease and the Unit
    Operating Agreement had been drafted by Tribute or its predecessor, the <i>contra <span class=SpellE>proferentum</span></i> principle applied.  Therefore, the
    applications judge concluded that “the failure to incorporate the necessary
    wording ‘in paying quantities’ is fatal” and that “[e]<span class=SpellE>xact</span> wording would have to be used in order to make that deemed production clause
    effective.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge added that there was no reason
    to expect that a party signing such an amending agreement “would anticipate
    finding, buried in a sub-clause dealing with payment, the potential change of
    the duration and term of the lease.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge declared that therefore the Oil
    and Gas Lease had terminated in 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge’s analysis of the Gas Storage
    Lease was straightforward.  The clause in
    Schedule B was clear -- it provided that the lease would terminate
    automatically on the tenth anniversary date if no application was made to the OEB.  That clause was paramount to the renewal
    clauses in the Gas Storage Lease itself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge reasoned that it did not matter
    whether either party knew about the term in the lease or what actions they took
    subsequent to the lease.  The automatic
    termination clause did not require Tribute to make an application to the OEB.  Therefore its failure to do so could not be
    regarded as a default from which relief against forfeiture could be
    claimed.  The reason that no application
    was made within the 10 year time limit did not matter.  No application was made and the lease came to
    an end.  The applications judge concluded
    that no contractual or equitable remedy was available to revive the Gas Storage
    Lease.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore the applications judge granted a declaration
    that the Gas Storage Lease terminated on September 24, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found in McKinley’s favour that both leases were
    terminated, the applications judge ordered Tribute to pay McKinley costs in the
    amount of $81,125.37 all inclusive.</p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;text-transform:

style='font-size:13.0pt;text-transform:uppercase'>Analysis</span></b></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties are agreed that the recent decision of this
    court in <span class=SpellE><i>Snopko</i></span><i> et al. v. Union Gas Ltd</i>., 2010 ONCA
    248, does not apply to this case.  In <span
class=SpellE><i>Snopko</i></span>, this
    court examined the scope of the privative clause set out in s. 38(3) of the <i>Ontario Energy Board Act</i>, 1998, S.O.
    1998, c. 15, <span class=SpellE>Sched</span>. B (the “Act”), which states as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>No action or other proceeding lies in respect of compensation payable
    under this section and, failing agreement, the amount shall be determined by
    the Board.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 38(1) provides that the OEB may make a
    designation order authorizing a person to “inject gas into, store gas in and
    remove gas from a designated gas storage area, and to enter into and upon the
    land in the area and use the land for that purpose” and such an authorized
    person is required under s. 38(2) to make “just and equitable compensation” for
    the right to store gas or for any damage resulting from the authority to do so.  The substances of the claims in this case do
    not fall within the language of s. 38(2) as no designation order has been made
    by the OEB in relation to these lands.   The
    court’s jurisdiction to determine the questions on appeal is not at issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to those questions, I begin with the Gas
    Storage Lease.  I agree with the analysis
    of the applications judge that the automatic termination clause of Schedule B
    is a true condition precedent.  It
    provides that the Gas Storage Lease will terminate on the tenth anniversary
    date “if and only if” Tribute or “some other person” has not made an
    application to the OEB.  The words of the
    clause and the contract read as a whole do not indicate that the automatic
    termination provision was for the benefit of one party or the other.  Rather, the parties chose a particular event,
    the non-occurrence of which would terminate the contract.  The clause does not place any obligation of
    performance on Tribute that McKinley could waive.  The applications judge was correct to find
    that the initial acceptance of the rental payment for the ensuing year could
    not constitute a waiver or <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span> by conduct on the
    part of McKinley.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge was correct to grant the
    declaration that the Gas Storage Lease terminated on September 24, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not, however, agree with the result reached by the
    applications judge in regard to the Oil and Gas Lease.  The Oil and Gas Lease and the Unit Operating
    Agreement are composed entirely of fine print.  While Tribute is an oil and gas company and McKinley operates a farm,
    these are commercial documents that create a sophisticated and long-term
    commercial arrangement.  I see no issue
    of a “camouflaged” clause or of language being “buried in a sub-clause”.  McKinley must be taken to have assented to
    the contents of the documents that it, or its predecessor, executed.  All that is necessary is to construe the
    language of the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The language of the contract does not support the
    distinction the applications judge made between “deemed production” and “deemed
    production in paying quantities”.  I
    repeat the language of para. 3 of the Unit Operating Agreement for convenience:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And as long as the payments in this clause provided are made or
    tendered, operations for the production of the leased substances from the unit
    area shall be deemed to be conducted by the lessee on the said lands under the
    said lease, and the said lease as hereby amended shall remain in full force and
    effect as to all of the said lands retained by the lessee under the said lease
    and/or this agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is deemed are “operations for the production of the
    leased substances from the unit area”<span class=GramE>.</span>  These operations are deemed “to be conducted
    by the lessee on the said lands under the said lease”.  The words “under the said lease” imply
    production in paying quantities because that is what the lease is about.  The more important point is that the clause
    provides that “deemed production” keeps the lease in full force and effect.  Moreover, I cannot agree that the location of
    the clause in the Unit Operating Agreement can be taken to mean it applies to compensation
    only and not to the term of the lease.  The
    words that the lease as amended shall “remain in full force and effect” could
    not be a clearer reference to the duration and term of the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude that the “deemed production clause”
    extended the lease as long as the annual rental payments continued to be made.  The rental payments were made, though some
    were late.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge did not find it necessary to
    deal with McKinley’s alternative submission that the Oil and Gas Lease
    terminated automatically when Tribute failed to make the annual rental payments
    by January 20 of every year.  As noted
    above, McKinley accepted the payments in the years in which they were made
    late.  I would not give effect to McKinley’s
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Oil and Gas Lease, as I read it, does not stipulate
    that failure to make the rental payments on time should operate to
    automatically terminate the contract.  Such a construction is inconsistent with the provision of the Oil and
    Gas Lease that provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In the event of default on the part of the Operator in making any
    payments hereunder or in complying with any of the conditions herein contained,
    the Land Owner shall notify the Operator by registered mail of his intention to
    cancel this lease.  The Operator shall
    have 30 days from the receipt of such notice in which to remedy such default
    failing which the Land Owner may proceed to cancel this lease according to law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McKinley never gave Tribute notice of default and intention
    to cancel the lease but accepted the late payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude that the applications judge erred by
    declaring that the Oil and Gas Lease terminated when the production of gas in
    paying quantities ceased in 2001. Operations for such production were deemed to
    continue by Tribute making annual rental payments, and the lease remained in
    full force and effect.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal in part by setting aside the applications
    judge’s declaration that the Oil and Gas Lease terminated.  I would grant a declaration that it is a
    valid and subsisting lease.  I would
    dismiss the appeal in regard to the applications judge’s declaration that the
    Gas Storage Lease terminated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would fix the appellant’s costs of the appeal in the
    amount of $15,000 including disbursements and GST.  As success before the applications judge
    should have been divided, I would set aside the applications judge’s
    disposition of costs and replace it with an order of no costs.  </p>
