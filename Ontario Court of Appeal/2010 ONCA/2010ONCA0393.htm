  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 16, 2009, Justice Morawetz approved a
    receivership sale involving 101 non-profit co-operative social housing units
    which comprise the assets of Thornhill Green Co-operative Homes Inc.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thornhill Green is a co-operative corporation established
    to provide affordable housing.  As such,
    it is regulated and governed by provincial legislation pertaining both to
    co-operative housing and social assistance housing.  The Regional Municipality of York is
    responsible under that legislation for supervising individual co-operatives and
    other social housing organizations in the region.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of various financial difficulties it had
    encountered, Thornhill Green was placed in receivership in 2006 at the instance
    of the Region<span lang=EN-US>.  Mintz &amp; Partners Ltd. was appointed
    receiver and manager and ultimately recommended the sale here in question – to </span>Housing
    York Inc., a body controlled by the Region.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants object to the approval of the sale.  They submit that non-profit housing
    co-operatives pose special challenges in a receivership context and that the
    factors to be considered in the exercise of the court’s discretion when
    approving such a sale are different from those normally applicable in an
    ordinary commercial receivership.  They
    contend that the motion judge did not properly consider the necessary
    co-operative-related factors in approving the sale and ask that it be set
    aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that the motion judge erred in this
    respect, and for the reasons that follow would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a co-operative corporation, Thornhill Green
    (sometimes referred to also as the “Co-op”) is governed by the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.35 and the <i>Social Housing
    Reform Act, 2000, </i>S.O. 2000, c. 27.  The Co-op was created as part of a provincial government program focused
    on providing affordable housing, with a mixture of subsidized and market rate
    units as part of its housing complex.  It
    consists of 101 townhouses located near Yonge Street in Thornhill.  Thornhill Green owned the land and buildings,
    which it purchased with provincial funding and long term mortgages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are more than 550 such non-profit housing
    co-operatives in Ontario, all governed by the special rules of the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> and
    subject to the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i>.  Most of these co-operatives (including
    Thornhill Green) are members of the appellant Co-operative Housing Federation
    of Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Social
    Housing Reform Act</i> designates municipalities as regional “Service Managers”,
    charged with supervising individual co-operatives and social housing
    organizations in their municipalities or regions.  The Region is therefore the Service Manager
    for Thornhill Green.  As such, it is
    responsible for administering and funding the housing programs.  This responsibility includes providing
    ongoing annual subsidies to housing providers such as Thornhill Green.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005 Thornhill Green’s financial difficulties began
    to mount.  It approached the Region, as
    its Service Manager, for possible additional mortgage financing in the amount
    of $2.1 million to fund a number of required capital repairs.  The Region agreed to provide the funding, but
    not before exercising its powers under the <i>Social
    Housing Reform Act </i>in July 2006 to appoint Mintz &amp; Partners (the “Receiver”)
    as a private receiver and manager of the Co-op to supervise the work to be done
    and to improve certain operational financial difficulties that the Region
    believed to exist at the Co-op as a result of mismanagement by its board of
    directors (the “Board”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Receiver reported that the Board’s shortcomings
    included the lack of adequate costs controls, its failure to maintain rents at
    appropriate rates, and the accumulation of an operating deficit exceeding
    $200,000 that depleted Thornhill Green’s capital reserve fund to almost
    nil.  In June 2007 Justice Pepall granted
    an Order appointing the Receiver as a court-appointed receiver and manager
    pursuant to s. 116(1)6 of the <i>Social
    Housing Reform Act</i> and s. 101 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i> (the “Appointment Order”).  This application was not opposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of carrying out the required capital
    repair work, the Receiver discovered asbestos in the Units.  This resulted in an additional $600,000 cost
    to complete the repairs.  The Region
    refused to advance these additional funds, taking the position as Service
    Manager that it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;
'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>would not advance any further funds to the Receiver for
    construction purposes, because it wished to end the receivership and put in
    place a more permanent arrangement;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;
'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>would not approve the taking of any additional debt by
    Thornhill Green, because the Co-op did not have the capacity to repay its
    existing debt, let alone take on additional obligations;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;
'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>would not support the return of Thornhill Green and its
    property to the Board or to a new Thornhill Green Board; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;'>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>would</span> only advance the
    necessary funds for the completion of the necessary capital repairs if the
    Thornhill Green assets were sold to Housing York and Housing York became the
    housing provider under the legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As set out in its First and Second Reports to the
    Court, the Receiver considered the various options open to it, including the
    possibility of returning governance to the then-existing or a newly-appointed
    Board of <span class=SpellE>Thornhill</span> Green, the sale of the assets to
    another entity capable of maintaining the complex as social housing, continuation
    of the receivership indefinitely, and the sale of the assets to Housing
    York.  The Receiver did not consider
    offering the assets for sale on the open market because that would potentially have
    removed Thornhill Green from the social housing stock.  It ultimately concluded that the sale to
    Housing York was the only viable option.  In arriving at that conclusion, the Receiver recognized that although Housing
    York was a not-for-profit corporation with the objective of promoting social
    housing, it was not a co-operative corporation regulated by the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> and
    therefore the proposed transaction would inevitably result in changes to the
    status of the Thornhill Green residents and to the governing structure of
    Thornhill Green: the residents would no longer be members of a co-operative,
    but would become tenants of Housing York.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Receiver concluded, however, that on balance the
    change in governance structure was desirable and, overall, would benefit the
    stakeholders of Thornhill Green, including the residents.  In part this conclusion was rooted in the
    reality of the Region’s position, outlined above, that it would not advance
    further funding to Thornhill Green itself (with or without a newly constituted
    Board) and would not fund the capital repairs unless the assets were sold to
    Housing York.  In part it was driven by
    the Receiver’s view that much of the required work was the result of the Board’s
    failure to deal with the problems over the years and by its perception that the
    members were not particularly interested in assuming the responsibilities of managing
    of the complex.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this basis, the Receiver applied to the Court for an
    order approving the sale to Housing York, vesting the Thornhill Green assets in
    the purchaser and granting other related relief.  Thornhill Green brought a cross-motion
    seeking to vary the Appointment Order by removing the Receiver’s power to sell
    the assets except in the ordinary course of business and, as well, to discharge
    Mintz &amp; Partners as receiver and manager.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morawetz J. granted the Receiver’s motion and dismissed
    Thornhill Green’s cross-motion to vary the Appointment Order.  The cross-motion seeking to discharge the
    Receiver was withdrawn at the opening of argument.  Only the Order approving the sale is the
    subject of this appeal.  The cross-motion
    order is not appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the issues and the motion judge’s
    determination, I observe that the receivership proceedings have been hotly and
    bitterly contested throughout.  Various
    members opposed the receivership once they became aware of it (although the
    Appointment Order was not contested and no attempt has ever been made to set it
    aside), resisted the Receiver’s attempts to carry out certain work in the
    units, threatened to sue the Receiver, and used the meetings with the Receiver
    to voice their individual concerns.  The
    appellants were upset when the Region first appointed the Receiver in 2006
    without prior notice or consultation with the Board, and were doubly so when
    the Region and the Receiver decided to sell the assets without consulting with
    or informing the Board in advance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were particularly incensed when – they
    say – as part of its plan to obtain the assets, the Region provided its
    necessary consent to the proposed sale under s.&nbsp;95 of the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i> in February
    2008 without any prior notice to or consultation with the Board or the members
    of Thornhill Green.  This decision became
    the subject of an application for judicial review to the Divisional Court.  The Divisional Court refused to quash the Region’s
    decision to consent to the sale, given the urgency of the situation and the
    fact that the approval motion was then pending before Morawetz J., but it found,
    nonetheless, that the Region had not met its obligations of procedural fairness
    to the Co-op in the process. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise the following issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do the principles that govern the approval of a
    receiver’s sale in the context of a co-operative non-profit social housing
    project differ from the standard principles that govern such a sale in an
    ordinary commercial transaction?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this context, did the motion judge err,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;
'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    characterizing Thornhill Green’s real estate and buildings as having no more
    that a “phantom equity”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;
'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    failing to recognize and to give effect to the special rights of the members
    respecting participation in management of the Co-op and security of members’
    tenure, flowing from the <i>Co-operative
    Corporations Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;
'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    failing to consider the availability of remedial education opportunities to
    assist the Board in improving its managerial skills and developing better
    management practices; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%;'>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>in</span> failing to give proper
    effect to the Divisional Court’s findings of lack of procedural fairness?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these complaints leads me to conclude that the
    motion judge’s discretionary approval of the sale should be set aside.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Standard of Review</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An order approving a sale sought by a Receiver is
    discretionary and attracts a great deal of deference from appellate courts,
    which will only interfere after exercising considerable caution and only in
    special circumstances.  The trial judge
    must have erred in law, seriously misapprehended the evidence, exercised his or
    her discretion based upon irrelevant or erroneous considerations, or failed to
    give any or sufficient weight to relevant considerations.  Appellate courts rely on the expertise of
    their appointed receivers and are reluctant to second guess their considered
    business decisions and recommendations.  Finally,
    courts will assume that receivers are acting properly unless the contrary is
    shown.  See <i>Regal Constellation Hotel Ltd. (Re)</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 355, at
    paras. 22-23 (C.A.).  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Applicable Principles</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard criteria that are to be applied when
    considering the approval of a sale recommended by a receiver are well
    established.  Commonly referred to as “the
    Soundair principles”, they were set out in this Court’s decision in <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Soundair Corp.</i> (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.) and re-affirmed in <i>Regal Constellation</i>.  In the
    latter decision, the Court summarized the applicable principles as follows, at
    paras. 24-26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In Soundair, at p. 6,
    Galligan J.A. outlined the duties of a court when deciding whether a receiver
    who has sold a property has acted properly. Those duties, in no order of
    priority, are to consider and determine:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) whether the receiver has made a
    sufficient effort to get the best price and has not acted improvidently;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) the interests of the parties;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) the efficacy and integrity of the
    process by which offers are obtained; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) <span class=GramE>whether</span> there
    has been unfairness in the working out of the process.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In Soundair as well, McKinlay J.A. emphasized [at
    p. 19 O.R.] the importance of protecting the integrity of the procedures
    followed by a court-appointed receiver “in the interests of both commercial
    morality and the future confidence of business persons in their dealings with
    receivers”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court-appointed
    receiver is an officer of the court. It has a fiduciary duty to act honestly
    and fairly on behalf of all claimants with an interest in the debtor’s
    property, including the debtor (and, where the debtor is a corporation, its
    shareholders). It must make candid and full disclosure to the court of all
    material facts respecting pending applications, whether favourable or
    unfavourable. <span class=GramE>See Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Usarco Ltd. <span

    196 D.L.R. (4th) 448</span></span> (Ont.
    C.A.), per Austin J.A. at paras.</span> 28-31, and the authorities referred to
    by him, for a more elaborate outline of these principles. It has been said with
    respect to a court-appointed receiver’s standard of care that the receiver “must
    act with meticulous correctness, but not to a standard of perfection”: Bennett
    on Receiverships, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1999) at p. 181, cited in
    Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Usarco, supra, at p. 459.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bennett submits on behalf of the appellants that different
    considerations apply when the receivership sale sought to be approved involves
    a non-profit housing co-operative subject to the provisions of the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> and the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i>.  He contends that such receiverships are
    different – frequently, as is the case here, they are often not about debt
    recovery – and they involve important statutory co-operative roles and rights
    under the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> that may be affected if the property is sold.  As a result, he argues that there is a particularly heavy onus on the
    receiver in such situations to satisfy the court that the sale of assets is
    necessary and that the process was fair to the co-operative and its
    members.  Indeed, he submits that a
    receiver should only rarely be able to sell the assets of a co-operative
    corporation, and then only for purposes of debt recovery.  Problems that primarily involve financial
    mismanagement by the board can be dealt with through proper education and
    training of the members who sit on co-operative boards, he says.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think that different <i>general</i> considerations apply when the receivership sale sought to
    be approved involves a non-profit housing co-operative subject to the
    provisions of the <i>Co-operative
    Corporations Act</i> and the <i>Social
    Housing Reform Act</i>.  That is not to
    say, however, that the special considerations arising in such circumstances are
    not to be taken into account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of assessing the receiver’s request for
    approval, the court will weigh the special factors pertaining to non-profit
    co-operative social housing, just as it would consider any unique circumstances
    in any receivership situation.  Without
    seeking to be exhaustive or to provide any particular order, those factors
    would include such things as (i) the continued viability of the project in its
    existing form; (ii) the statutory rights of co-operative members under the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> to
    participate in management and to have greater security of tenure; (iii) the
    particular impact of legislative or other strictures on the value of the
    property in question, and (iv) the need to preserve the availability of social
    public housing, whatever form that vehicle might take.  But these factors will fall to be considered
    under some or all of the four Soundair criteria – the best efforts requirement
    on the part of the receiver, the interests of the parties, the efficacy and
    integrity of the process and the existence of any unfairness in the working out
    of the process.  The need to be alive to these
    special factors does not change the general Soundair principles that normally
    govern the court’s approval of a receivership sale.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The notion that a receiver should only be entitled to
    sell the assets of a non-profit housing co-operative for debt recovery purposes
    is not consistent with the provisions of the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i> and the Regulation passed pursuant to
    that section.  The effect of those
    provisions is to empower a receiver or receiver and manager to “sell, lease,
    give as security or otherwise dispose of the housing project and the assets of
    the housing provider.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 116 of the Act provides that a service manager
    may obtain the appointment of a receiver or a receiver and manager “[i]f a
    triggering event occurs.”  Section 115
    defines “triggering events” for purposes of the Act.  There are fourteen such events, only two of
    which involve the housing provider becoming bankrupt or insolvent or being
    unable to meet its obligations as they become due.  Others include the housing provider contravening
    the Act or regulations, incurring material expenses that are excessive,
    incurring an accumulated deficit that is material and excessive, and failing to
    operate the housing project properly.  No
    limitation is imposed on the power of the receiver or receiver and manager to
    sell the property to correct such triggering events.  In short, there is nothing in the <i>Act</i> or regulation to restrict the power
    of sale to situations of debt recovery.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Motion Judge’s Decision</span></u><span lang=EN-US> </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge applied these very principles.  He was acutely alive to the special
    considerations that were in play because of the co-operative/social housing
    nature of the receivership.   While he
    did not accept the appellant’s submissions on the issues they raised before him
    – and raise here again – he considered those issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, in the context of dealing with the
    cross-motion to delete the power of sale from the Receiver’s powers, the motion
    judge “acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding a potential remedy of
    sale in the context of a social housing complex, is arguably quite different
    than a remedy of sale in respect of an operating business,” and later, when
    dealing with the approval of the sale, he re-affirmed that “certain of the
    issues involved in this receivership are unique to the fact that this matter
    involves a rental housing project that is part of the social housing network in
    the Region.”  His reasons make it clear
    that he understood he was dealing with social housing in the context of a
    co-operative corporation.  The motion
    judge reviewed the circumstances leading up to the receivership – outlined
    above – and to the decision to sell the assets, including the proceedings
    before the Divisional Court (to which he referred at length).</p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Financial Viability of Thornhill
    Green and the “Market Value” of its Assets</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thornhill Green and the Co-operative Housing Federation
    argued before the motion judge that Thornhill Green was financially and
    organizationally viable on a going-forward basis and that the assets had a “market
    value” of $14.5 million against liabilities of $8.9 million, leaving a net
    equity of $5.6 million.  They argue here
    that the trial judge erred in rejecting this submission, thereby permitting the
    purchaser – a wholly owned subsidiary of the Region – to obtain the property at
    a windfall price.  Because the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> provides
    that upon dissolution of a co-operative any net proceeds are to be transferred
    to a charity or to another housing co-operative, the appellants submit that the
    motion judge’s dismissal of this equity as a “phantom equity” not only tainted
    his assessment of the Receiver’s motion, but also wrongfully deprived other
    worthy projects of the benefit of this net equity on the sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge properly rejected the appellant’s
    submissions in this regard, in my opinion.  He correctly pointed out that the submissions were misconceived because
    of the reality of the legal context in which Thornhill Green holds the
    assets.  Particularly telling amongst the
    impediments were the fact that (i) the property cannot simply be sold on the
    open market because under s. 95 of the <i>Social
    Housing Reform Act</i>, Thornhill Green cannot offer or dispose of it without
    the consent of the Minister and (ii) Thornhill Green cannot encumber or dispose
    of the property without the Region’s consent in view of the various covenants
    given by Thornhill Green to the Region regarding its credit facilities.  Not only did these factors hinder the sale of
    the assets and undercut their “market value,” they undermined any ability of
    the Co-op to raise the financing necessary to fund the very considerable
    upgrades required and the long-term capital and maintenance needs Thornhill
    faced.  Contrary to the appellants’
    contention, it was unrealistic to expect that the Region would grant its
    consent to the required financing, and unlikely that the Minister would do so
    in the face of the Region’s position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, the motion judge’s conclusion
    that, because of the relevant statutory framework and the other factors
    involved, the suggested net equity of $5.6 million was a “phantom equity” and
    not comparable to equity held by an ordinary business corporation, was quite
    accurate.</p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Special Co-operative Residency and
    Participation Rights</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants next contend that the motion judge
    seriously misconstrued the nature of co-operative members’ rights “to
    participate fully and equally in [the Co-op’s] operation and management,” and
    to enjoy “security of tenure comparable to private ownership”: <i>McBride v. Comfort Living Housing
    Co-operative Inc.</i> (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 394, at p. 401 (C.A.).  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the motion judge acknowledged the fact that the
    proposed sale would involve a change in status of the residents from members of
    a co-operative corporation (with the attendant rights of participation and
    security of tenure flowing from the operation of the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i>) to tenants whose rights will be
    governed by the <i>Residential Tenancies Act</i>.  He noted that the proposed sale would result
    in leases that would preserve the ability of the former co-operative members to
    live in their same units, with the same or similar rental obligations, and that
    Housing York has not-for-profit objectives similar to those of Thornhill Green
    – to provide social housing in an effective manner.  The motion judge said, for example:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is recognized that currently each member of
    Thornhill Green is the beneficiary of protected housing rights, including
    occupancy rights and the right to participate in management, confirmed in the
    CCA and that a sale to HYI will eliminate occupancy rights of members and
    replace them with tenancy rights.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, the provisions
    of the SHRA, including those provisions dealing with the Receiver’s powers to
    sell the assets of a housing provider, apply despite any act or regulation to
    the contrary.  Further, pursuant to s.
    156 of the SHRA, where there is a conflict between any act or regulation and
    the SHRA, it is the SHRA that prevails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the motion judge recognized the conflict
    between the rights enjoyed by co-operative members under the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i> and the
    consequences flowing from the proposed sale of the assets explicitly permitted
    under the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i> that would effectively eliminate some of those rights.  However, as he correctly identified, s. 156
    of the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i> specifically provides that the provisions of that <i>Act</i> – including those provisions dealing with the Receiver’s power
    to sell the assets of a housing provider like Thornhill Green – apply despite
    any act or regulation to the contrary.  Moreover, the same section makes it clear that in the event of a
    conflict between the <i>Social Housing
    Reform Act</i> and any other act or regulation, the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i> prevails.  It follows from this statutory framework that the rights accruing to
    co-operative members under the <i>Co-operative
    Corporations Act</i> with respect to participation in management of the Co-op
    and to security of tenure need not outweigh the Receiver’s power to sell, even
    to a non-co-operative corporation purchaser, in appropriate circumstances.  It will depend on the circumstances.  Co-operative members’ rights are factors to
    be considered – as the motion judge did here – but in the end, like many other “rights”
    in a receivership, they may end up being compromised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was satisfied that in these
    circumstances, the underlying financial problems demanded a sale because the <i>status quo</i> was not an acceptable
    alternative.  As he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The inescapable conclusion
    is that the co-operative governance model of Thornhill Green has not worked as
    envisioned.  In my view, an operational
    change is necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He concluded that the only viable alternative to the <i>status quo</i> was the proposed sale to
    Housing York.  I see no basis for
    interfering with his balancing of the differing interests in this regard.</p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Training and Education for Board Members</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Klippenstein and Mr. Bennett placed considerable
    emphasis in oral argument on the motion judges’ alleged failure to consider the
    possibility of assistance and training for the Co-op members and directors as a
    means of overcoming the problems of financial mismanagement, thereby providing
    an alternative to sale and permitting the project to continue under the
    existing co-operative framework.  I am
    not persuaded, however, that this is a basis for interfering with his
    discretion to approve the sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It does not follow from the fact that the motion judge
    may not have referred to this issue that he did not consider it: <i>R v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at
    paras. 23 and 26.  There is no
    requirement to “demonstrate that all aspects of the evidence have been
    considered, nor is it necessary that reasons be given for every point raised in
    the case”: <i>Canadian Broadcasting
    Corporation Pension Plan v. BF Realty Holdings Ltd.</i> (2002), 214 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    121 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 64.  In the
    end, an appellate court is only justified in intervening on such a ground if
    the omission in the reasons leads to a reasonable belief that the motion judge “must
    have forgotten, ignored or misconceived the evidence <i>in a way that affected his conclusion</i>”: <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 39 (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept the appellants’ submission that attempts to
    educate co-operative housing providers in order to assist them to overcome
    managerial difficulties may be important and are consistent with the purpose of
    the <i>Social Housing Reform Act</i>, which
    is “to provide for the efficient and effective administration of housing
    programs by service managers” (s. 1).  Assisting and educating housing providers is preferable to limiting or
    punishing them: see <i>Labourview
    Co-operatives Homes Inc. v. Chatham Kent (Municipality)</i> (2007) O.A.C. 65
    (Div. Ct.), at para 28.  In that same
    case, at para. 23, the Divisional Court noted that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Housing programs are
    social programs, intended to generally assist society in the province, by
    providing financial and material assistance to the housing needs of the
    disadvantaged.  The enforcement
    provisions of the <i>SHRA</i> must be
    interpreted so as to best ensure the objects of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, there is some evidence that educational programs
    might be available through the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada.  However, there is simply no evidence that any
    of the directors or members of Thornhill Green expressed any interest in or
    willingness to participate in any such programs.  If the Receiver was to focus on the
    rehabilitation of the Co-op to health rather than on its sale and abolition, as
    the appellants submit, one would have expected some evidence on the part of
    those involved of their willingness to participate in the rehabilitative
    exercise.  There was none.  At no time did the appellants ever provide to
    the Receiver, or to the Court, any serious or substantive plan to put improved
    management in place or to educate and assist the members and Board to put
    better financial and other management practices in place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there was no basis upon which the motion
    judge could credibly find that simply educating and providing assistance to
    members of the Co-op’s Board would resolve the underlying significant financial
    and management problems confronting Thornhill Green.  The “education and training” argument was not
    viable.  The motion judge can hardly be
    criticized for not mentioning it in his reasons, in my view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Procedural Fairness</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept the argument that the motion judge
    failed to give proper effect to the finding of the Divisional Court that the
    Region had not met its obligations of procedural fairness to Thornhill
    Green.  The appellants say this finding
    represented a serious infringement of the Co-op’s legitimate procedural
    expectations, and therefore contaminated the sale proceedings beyond
    redemption.  In addition, they contend
    that the Region was seeking to sell the assets to its own subsidiary, at a
    price below the Co-op’s net equity, and this, coupled with the Region’s own
    actions in cutting off further funding, created an unfair process that the
    motion judge failed to examine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proceedings before Morawetz J. were adjourned
    pending the outcome of the application for judicial review before the
    Divisional Court.  That Court did not
    suggest to the motion judge that he treat its procedural fairness finding as
    determinative.  In deciding not to quash
    the Region’s consent to the proposed sale, the Court simply observed that
    Thornhill Green would have “ample opportunity to address all issues fully and
    fairly in the proceedings pending before [the motion judge].”  Following the Divisional Court’s decision, the
    parties all had the opportunity to, and did, file further written submissions
    with the motion judge.  The motion judge
    considered those submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, he considered the submission that “due
    in part to the Region’s conduct, the Receiver was unable to exercise its duty
    to act ‘reasonably, prudently and fairly and not arbitrarily’ in selling the
    assets.”  He rejected the argument,
    noting that the Region was under no obligation to extend additional funding or
    credit to Thornhill Green and concluding that, although the Divisional Court
    had “found fault in the manner in which the Region initially proceeded,” the
    Court’s primary focus was “on the practical realities facing Thornhill Green,
    namely, that the unresolved underlying financial problems of [the Co-op]
    required attention.”  I add, as well,
    that there is no suggestion in this case that the Region, as Service Manager,
    abused its power or acted contrary to the intent of the legislation in refusing
    to authorize further borrowing by Thornhill Green.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the Receiver’s overall conduct, and the
    allegation that it had breached its fiduciary obligations to all interested
    parties, the motion judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not give effect to this submission.  The Receiver has been in place for a
    considerable period of time.  I have
    dismissed the cross-motion to vary the powers of the Receiver and the motion to
    discharge the Receiver has been withdrawn.  I am satisfied that the Receiver has acted within its mandate and has
    reported to court and has proposed a Transaction which, in the circumstances, I
    find to be fair and reasonable.  In my
    view, the Receiver has carefully considered the available options.  In arriving at its recommendation that the
    Transaction be approved, I find that the Receiver has taken into account the
    interests of the members of Thornhill Green and has proposed a resolution that
    substantially protects the interests of the residents.  The Receiver has also proposed a transaction
    which reflects the commercial realities of the situation and addresses in a
    comprehensive manner the financial problems currently facing Thornhill Green.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that the
    Receiver has acted fairly and diligently in carrying out its activities during
    its appointment and, in particular, the sales process.  In my view, the Receiver has acted in
    accordance with the <i>Soundair</i> principles set out above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings and conclusions are amply supported on
    the record.  They were made on an
    application of the appropriate <i>Soundair</i> principles, including a full consideration of the particularly distinctive
    factors arising from the co-operative social housing dynamics of the case.  This is what was required of the motion
    judge.  I see no basis for interfering
    with the exercise of his discretion in the circumstances.  In fact, I agree with it.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
