  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Meloche Monnex appeals the judgment
    declaring that the appellant had a duty to defend Brent Meadows in an action
    brought in the Ontario Superior Court by David Skidmore for civil intentional
    assault and battery.  The application
    judge concluded the claim came within the terms of coverage of the respondents’
    homeowner’s insurance policy issued by the appellant.  For the reasons that follow I would allow the
    appeal and set aside the application judge’s decision replacing it with a
    dismissal of the application.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent Brent Meadows is a defendant in an action brought by David
    Skidmore.  Skidmore’s claim relates to
    injuries he allegedly suffered in a physical altercation with Brent Meadows in
    a Carlton University residence while they were both students there in September
    2003.  In the action, Skidmore claims
    damages of approximately $750,000 against Brent Meadows, his friend Benjamin
    Crawford and Carlton University.  Skidmore’s claim describes an unprovoked attack.  Brent Meadows, in his statement of defence,
    argues that he acted in self-defence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Brent
    Meadows’ lawyer notified the appellant of the claim.  The respondents took the position that the
    claim against Brent Meadows came within the terms of coverage of their
    homeowner’s policy purchased from the appellant.  As a result, the respondents claimed that the
    appellant had the duty to defend Brent Meadows in the action.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    examining the claim, the appellant took the position that the policy did not
    cover intentional acts such as those alleged by Skidmore.  They therefore advised the respondents that
    they would not be providing a defence to the action.  The respondents then brought the within
    application under rules 14.05(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) and (h) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    194, for a determination of their rights under the insurance contract.  Specifically, they sought declarations that
    the appellant owed a duty to defend Brent Meadows in Skidmore’s action and that
    Brent Meadows was entitled to retain and instruct his own solicitor in the
    action.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    support of the application, the respondents filed affidavit evidence and their
    statement of defence, arguing that these were required to set out their
    position that Brent Meadows was acting in self-defence when he hit Skidmore.  In the respondents’ submission, acting in
    self-defence is not an intentional act within the meaning of the policy and, as
    a result, would fall within coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant argued that the court should not consider the extrinsic evidence in
    determining whether the insurer has a duty to defend.  Rather, the court is confined to the
    statement of claim, the document that makes the allegations against the insured,
    to determine the nature of the allegations.  In the appellant’s submission, the allegations in the statement of claim
    are of intentional acts, which are not covered by the policy of insurance and
    do not give rise to a duty to defend.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    application judge accepted that it had seemed to be settled law that only the
    document making allegations against the insured should be considered in
    determining the existence of a duty to defend, but held that a recent line of
    authority has allowed an exception to this principle where an insured claims
    self-defence against an alleged intentional tort.  In these cases, the courts have considered
    extrinsic documents and concluded that insurers are required to defend the
    allegations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The
    application judge also held that “self-defence is not an ‘intended act’ within
    the meaning of the insurance policy.”  He
    considered Brent Meadows’ statement of defence and affidavit evidence filed by
    the respondents and came to the conclusion that the appellant had a duty to
    defend Brent Meadows in the Skidmore action.  He awarded the respondents substantial indemnity costs.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the application judge erred
    in:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'>1.   <span class=GramE>considering</span> extrinsic evidence beyond the
    statement of claim; </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'>2.   <span class=GramE>concluding</span> that there was an obligation
    to defend; and</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'>3.   <span class=GramE>awarding</span> substantial indemnity costs.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the duty to defend is to be decided
    entirely by reference to the statement of claim and the terms of the
    policy.  In the appellant’s submission,
    it is clear from the statement of claim that an intentional act is alleged and
    it is equally clear from the policy of insurance that intentional acts are
    excluded from coverage.  It is the
    position of the appellant that the application judge erred in law by
    considering evidence beyond the statement of claim in the Skidmore action in
    determining whether the appellant owed a duty to defend the respondent and in
    concluding that the claim might trigger an obligation on the appellant to
    indemnify.  The appellant also appeals
    the costs order made in favour of the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents submit that the application judge was
    entitled to consider the statement of defence and the affidavit evidence filed
    by the respondents on the motion.  It is
    apparent from a review of that material that the respondents’ position is that
    Brent Meadows was acting in self defence.  This, in the respondents’ view, does not constitute an intentional act
    within the meaning of the insurance policy and the application judge, applying <i>Thorne v. Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance
    Co. of Canada</i> (2003), 230 D.L.R. (4th) 587 (N.B.C.A.), <i>Hawkes v. TD Home &amp; Auto Insurance Co.</i> (2007), 88 O.R. (3d) 796
    (S.C.), and <i>Glassford </i>v. <i>TD Home &amp; Auto Insurance Co.</i> (2009),
    94 O.R. (3d) 630 (S.C.), properly found that it came within the terms of
    coverage of the policy.  In support of
    their position the respondents rely on <i>Thorne </i>and <i>Glassford</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow it is my view that whether
    or not reference is made to the additional materials the result is the
    same.  There is no duty on the appellant
    to defend and the appeal ought to be allowed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that “[i]t is not necessary to prove
    that the obligation to indemnify will in fact arise in order to trigger the
    duty to defend.  The mere possibility
    that a claim within the policy may succeed suffices”: <i>Nichols v. American Home Assurance Co.</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801, at p.
    810.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To trigger the duty to defend, the insured must
    therefore show the basis on which the policy may be called upon to
    indemnify.  In order to determine whether
    there is a “possibility” that the claim will come within the terms of the
    policy, we look first to the statement of claim.  As set out in <i>Monenco Ltd. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 699, at
    para. 28: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The starting premise for assessing whether an
    insurer’s duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional “pleadings
    rule”.  Whether an insurer is bound to
    defend a particular claim has been conventionally addressed by relying on the
    allegations made in the pleadings filed against the insured, usually in the
    form of a statement of claim.  If the
    pleadings allege facts which, if true, would require the insurer to indemnify
    the insured for the claim, then the insurer is obliged to provide a
    defence.  This remains so even though the
    actual facts may differ from the allegations pleaded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court in <i>Monenco</i> at para. 31 went on to explain that where the pleadings are not framed with
    sufficient precision to determine whether the claims are covered by a policy,
    the insurers’ obligation to defend will be triggered where, on a reasonable
    reading of the pleadings, a claim within coverage can be inferred.  Any doubt as to whether the pleadings bring
    the incident within the coverage of the policy ought to be resolved in favour
    of the insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court of Canada has, however, cautioned
    that the terms used and assertions made in a statement of claim are not
    necessarily determinative of whether coverage under a policy is triggered.  In <i>Non-Marine
    Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London v. Scalera</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 551, at para.
    79, Iacobucci J. said that “[w]hat really matters is not the labels used by the
    plaintiff, but the true nature of the claim”.  In other words, courts should look behind the literal terms contained in
    the pleadings to assess whether the legal claims put forward are supported by
    the factual allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Scalera</i>, at
    para. 89, Iacobucci J. explained that in the context of an insurance contract’s
    intentional injury exclusion clause the goal is to determine the gravamen of the
    complaint, and whether one can infer <span class=GramE>an intent</span> to
    injure from that complaint.  Where both a
    negligence and an intentional tort claim arise from the same actions and cause
    the same harm, the negligence claim is “derivative, and it will be subsumed
    into the intentional tort for purposes of the exclusion clause analysis”:  <i>Scalera</i>,
    at para. 85.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, although the claim refers to
    negligence, it is clear from a reading of the statement of claim as a whole
    that the gravamen of the claim is assault and battery, intentional torts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is apparent from a reading of para. 8 of the
    statement of claim, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The particulars of the negligence of the Defendants
    Meadows and Crawford are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)    they violently and viciously assaulted the Plaintiff;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)    they knowingly and intentionally caused harm to the
    Plaintiff;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)    they inflicted severe harm to the Plaintiff despite knowing
    that he did not intend to cause them any harm;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)    they initiated an unprovoked attack against the Plaintiff
    when he attempted to come to the aid of another student they were harassing;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e)    they continued to viciously assault the Plaintiff even after
    he was rendered unconscious; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(f)     they continued to violently assault the Plaintiff even whe[n]
    they knew or ought to have known that he could not defend himself against said
    attack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The insurance policy at issue in the present case does
    not provide coverage for intentional torts.  The coverage portion of the policy states, “[w]e will pay all sums which
    you become legally liable to pay as compensatory damages because of
    unintentional bodily injury or property damage” (emphasis removed).  This is confirmed by an exclusion clause in
    the policy that states, “[w]e <span class=GramE>do</span> not insure claims
    arising from … bodily injury or property damage caused by any intentional or
    criminal act” (emphasis removed).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The practical result therefore is that if the plaintiff
    in the action succeeds, he will have shown it to be an assault.  This is an intentional act and is excluded
    from coverage.  If the plaintiff does not
    succeed in the action, there is nothing to indemnify and, therefore, no insured
    claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue that a third option exists:  David Skidmore’s action may succeed in
    negligence even if the court finds that there has been no assault.  This, the respondents argue, would be on the
    basis that Brent Meadows was acting in self-defence but negligently used
    excessive force in his self-defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there is no reasonable interpretation of
    the claim that would result in such a finding.  As I have noted above, either Brent Meadows
    will be found liable for assault and battery or he will, as he alleges in his
    statement of defence, be found not to be liable on the basis that he was acting
    in self-defence.  In the present appeal
    there is no suggestion that Brent Meadows’ act – hitting the appellant – is
    anything other than intentional.  If a
    tort is intended, it does not matter that the result is more harmful than the
    actor should or even could have foreseen:  see <i>Scalera</i>,<i> </i>at para. 99.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching his conclusion that there may be a duty to
    indemnify, the application judge relied on extrinsic evidence.  In <i>Monenco,</i> the Supreme Court of Canada expressed that caution should be used when looking
    beyond the statement of claim in order to determine the “substance” and “true
    nature” of the claim.  While not
    prohibiting consideration of extrinsic evidence, Justice Iacobucci writing for
    the court stated at para. 36 that “[w]ithout wishing to decide the extent to
    which extrinsic evidence can be considered, I am of the view that extrinsic
    evidence that has been explicitly referred to within the pleadings may be
    considered to determine the substance and true nature of the allegations, and
    thus, to appreciate the nature and scope of an insurer’s duty to defend.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming without deciding that we can refer to the
    extrinsic evidence filed by the respondent, this evidence does no more than set
    out the respondents’ position that Brent Meadows was acting in self-defence and
    provide context for this allegation.  It
    does not raise the possibility that the claim might somehow succeed in
    negligence, thereby triggering the duty to indemnify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the respondents’ and the application judge’s reliance
    on the cases of <i>Thorne</i>, <i>Hawkes </i>and <i>Glassford</i>, in my view the <i>Thorne</i> decision has no application to the issues raised in the present action.  That case involved a commercial general
    liability policy and not a home owner’s policy.  The coverage provisions in that policy were different than the appellant’s
    policy.  More importantly, the exclusion
    from coverage for intentional bodily injury in the policy at issue in <i>Thorne </i>contained an exception whereby
    the exclusion did not apply to bodily injury resulting from the use of
    reasonable force to protect persons or property.  It is because the intentional tort exclusion
    contained an exception for self-defence that the New Brunswick Court of Appeal
    concluded that, reading the policy as a whole, the coverage envisaged by the
    policy encompassed the duty to defend where self-defence was raised.  Otherwise, the exception to the exclusion
    would be meaningless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The homeowner’s policy at issue in our proceeding does
    not contain the exception found in the policy in <i>Thorne</i>.  In clear terms it
    indicates that it does not cover claims for injury caused by any intentional
    act.  There is, therefore, no basis for
    concluding that the parties to the agreement intended that the coverage
    provisions of the policy be interpreted as including a duty to defend where
    self-defence is at issue.  As to the<i> Hawkes </i>and <i>Glassford </i>decisions, to the extent that they are inconsistent with
    these reasons, I disagree with them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, therefore, I am of the view that on a
    reasonable reading of the claim it is apparent that it is strictly one for the
    intentional torts of assault and battery.  When the terms of the policy are considered, it is clear that there is
    no possibility that the obligation to indemnify will be triggered by such a
    claim and therefore there is no duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
    application judge’s decision replacing it with a dismissal of the
    application.  I would award the appellant
    costs of the appeal fixed at $6,000 and costs of the application fixed at
    $6,000 both inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
