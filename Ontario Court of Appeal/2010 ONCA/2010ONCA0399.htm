  <h2>By the Court:</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>The appellant, Great Lakes Power Limited, <span
style='line-height:200%'>is an electricity
    distributor.  The rate it is entitled to
    charge its customers for electricity is set by the respondent, the Ontario
    Energy Board, under s. 78(3) of the <i>Ontario
    Energy Board Act, 1998</i> S.O. 1998, <span class=GramE>c</span>. 15, Sched.
    B.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In 2002, the utility applied to the Board for approval of its
    proposed rates for that year.  This
    application was premised on a revenue requirement of $12.7 million per
    year.  However, in order to avoid “rate
    shock” to its customers, the utility reduced its request to $9.8 million per
    year.  The remaining $2.9 million per
    year would be recorded on its books as a “rate deferral plan”, to be recovered
    from its customers later.  The utility
    proposed to record these amounts in a specific account referred to as “Account
    1574”.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On May 13, 2002, the Board issued an interim order approving
    the utility’s rates in amounts corresponding to a $9.8 million revenue
    requirement pending a full public hearing.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Before the Board could hold a public hearing, the Ontario
    government enacted legislation in December, 2002 that temporarily froze
    electricity rates.   The legislation,
    known as “Bill 210”, also deemed any existing interim orders of the Board to be
    final.  The rate freeze was in effect for
    two years.  On December 9, 2004, Bill 210
    was repealed. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In August, 2007, the utility applied to the Board for
    approval of its rates for 2007.  Included
    in the application was a claim for disbursement of $14.9 million - the
    utility’s remaining deferral account balance as recorded in account 1574 – over
    several years. The utility argued not only that the Board had approved its revenue
    requirement of $12.7 million and the rate deferral plan in its interim decision
    of 2002, but also that the decision had become final by virtue of Bill 210. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Board rejected the utility’s claim for recovery of the
    $14.9 million.  The Board held that in
    its interim order of 2002, it had not approved the utility’s revenue
    requirement of $12.7 million, or its rate deferral plan.  Indeed, the interim order made no mention of
    either.  The Board made it clear that it
    would not have provided the utility with the approvals it sought without
    holding a public hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The utility appealed the decision to the Divisional Court, arguing
    that the Board misinterpreted the scope of the 2002 interim order and erred by
    failing to take into account the effect of Bill 210.  As a result, the Board’s decision denied the
    utility the opportunity to realize a fair and reasonable return on its investment.

style='line-height:200%'>For the following reasons,

  <h2>Analysis </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Before examining the utility’s arguments, we will deal with
    the standard of review and briefly explain the concept of a prudence review.</span></p>
  <h2>(i)        Standard
    of Review </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In terms of the standard of review, we do not agree with
    counsel for the utility that the Divisional Court erred in reviewing the
    decision of the Board on the basis of reasonableness.  The issue before the Board involved an
    interpretation of its own order, an issue calling upon the Board’s expertise
    and policy considerations.  Accordingly,
    the recent decisions of this court in <i>Graywood
    Investments Ltd. v. Toronto Hydro Electric System Ltd.,</i> 2006 CanLII 16823
    at para. 24 (ON C.A.) <i>Natural Resource
    Gas Ltd. v. Ontario Energy Board</i>, 2006 CanLII 24440 at paras. 23 and 24 (ON
    C.A.) and </span><i>Toronto Hydro-Electric
    System Limited&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Ontario Energy Board</i>,&nbsp;2010 ONCA 284<span
style='line-height:200%'>, apply.  These decisions establish that, in these
    circumstances, the standard of review from orders of the <span class=GramE>Board,</span> is reasonableness. </span></p>
  <h2>(ii)       Prudency
    Review</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Through a process called a prudency review, the Board
    responds to its obligations under the Act to protect the interest of ratepayers
    by reviewing a distributor’s revenue requirement and ensuring that it is
    reasonable before passing the costs off to its customers.  It is undisputed that the utility’s full
    revenue requirement of $12.7 million did not undergo the usual prudency review
    process which, in the normal course, would have required, among other things,
    notice to interested parties and an opportunity for them to present submissions
    at a hearing.</span></p>
  <h2>(iii)     The
    Utility’s Arguments   </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, the utility submits that the Board and the Divisional
    Court erred in failing to recognize that the 2002 interim order constituted an
    approval of its revenue requirement and its rate deferral plan.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We disagree.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Board rejected the utility’s submissions that, in the
    2002 interim decision, it approved the proposed $12.7 million revenue
    requirement and the rate deferral plan.  It gave reasons for this rejection that can be summarized, as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The submission was not supported by the evidence
    and therefore was entirely speculative.  The Board’s silence on the issue could not reasonably be interpreted as supporting
    the inference that the Board was endorsing a material proposition affecting
    present and future rates.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The 2002 interim order was the first order the
    Board made in its regulation of the utility’s distribution business.  It is inconceivable that the Board would
    approve something of this magnitude without hearing from interested indiv-iduals.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The utility was attaching more importance to the
    2002 interim order than is warranted as interim orders are generally based on
    an incomplete evidentiary record that is generally not tested.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'> Based on these
    findings, the Board had no difficulty concluding that the proposed revenue
    requirement and the rate deferral plan had never explicitly or implicitly been
    approved.  Accordingly, allowing the
    utility to dispose of Account 1574 as <span class=GramE>requested,</span> would
    be contrary to regulatory practice.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the light of the considerable deference to which the Board
    is entitled in determining what it means and does not mean in one of its
    orders, we agree with the Divisional Court’s conclusion that the Board’s
    holding that the interim order was not meant to cover the $12.7 million revenue
    requirement and the rate deferral plan, is reasonable</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Having upheld the Board’s conclusion that the interim order
    did not deal with the $12.7 million revenue requirement and the rate deferral
    plan, it is not necessary to consider the appellant’s argument based on Bill
    210’s having rendered the interim order, final. The Bill cannot render final an
    issue that was not dealt with in the interim order.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, counsel for the utility raises the issue of
    fairness.  He forcefully argues that Bill
    210 should not be interpreted in such a way as to interfere with his client’s
    right to a fair return on its investment.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The objective of fairness, no matter how compelling, cannot
    justify a redefinition of the terms of the interim order.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Furthermore, the argument that the Board’s interpretation of Bill
    210 would have the effect of foreclosing the utility’s right to prove its
    entitlement to the amounts accrued under the rate deferral plan, ignores those
    parts of the legislation that allow the utility to approach the Board for that
    very purpose.  Having made a conscious
    decision to forego a prudency review under Bill 210 and related regulatory
    framework, the utility’s argument that it has been unfairly treated must
    fail.  </span></p>
  <h2>Conclusion </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A public utility must undergo a prudency review before
    passing along its costs to consumers. To this point, the utility has not done
    so and therefore is not entitled to the benefit of an approved rate of return.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Our conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed should not
    be taken to preclude the utility from going before the Board, with proper
    evidence, for a prudency review. We note that before this court, counsel for
    the Board did not suggest that the provisions in Bill 210 relating to Account 1574,
    were not available to the utility.  He
    also did not argue that the utility could not now apply for approval of the proposed
    $12.7 million revenue requirement and the rate deferral plan under s. 78 of the
    Act.  Moreover, despite some arguable
    ambiguity in the language used in the Board’s 2007 decision, counsel for the
    Board submitted that the Board had not in any way denied the utility’s
    entitlement to go before the Board and seek approval for its revenue
    requirement or its rate deferral plan.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Having regard to the “regulatory compact” (as coined by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Atco Gas &amp;
    Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta Utilities Board</i>, 2006 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 193
    at para. 63) that requires a balancing of rights and interests of utilities
    against those of ratepayers, the ideal situation would be for the Board to
    decide upon the utility’s entitlement to approval of its proposed revenue
