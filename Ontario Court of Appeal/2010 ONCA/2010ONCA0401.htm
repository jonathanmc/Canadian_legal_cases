  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The narrow issue on this appeal is whether the offer to
    lease commercial premises entered into by the parties constitutes a valid and
    enforceable lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in
    accepting parol evidence when there was no ambiguity in the terms of the signed
    offer to lease.  They submit that having
    found that the parties had agreed upon the rent, the commencement date, the
    term of the tenancy and identified the premises, the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that the offer to lease represented agreement on all material
    terms necessary to constitute a valid and binding lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made clear findings of fact that the
    offer to lease did not constitute a binding lease agreement, but was merely
    preparatory to a formal commercial lease which was never signed.  The trial judge accepted the respondent’s
    evidence that he had no intention to enter into a binding agreement by signing
    the offer.  He also accepted the evidence
    of the respondent and his witnesses that: the appellants had assured the
    respondent that the offer was not a binding contract, but was a preparatory
    document for negotiation of the formal lease that would be the binding agreement;
    possession would not be granted until the formal lease was signed; and the
    respondent never gained possession of the premises.  The trial judge also noted that there was no
    schedule listing the chattels despite the fact that this was to be a turnkey lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings were open to the trial judge on this
    record. Indeed, before this court, the appellants accept the trial judge’s key
    finding that the appellants assured the respondent that the offer to lease was
    not binding and that a formal lease would be required.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the parties’ discussions concerning the
    import of the offer to lease was admissible with respect to the issue whether
    the parties intended to enter into a binding agreement upon signing the offer
    or whether the offer was considered part of the negotiations for the formal
    binding lease to be signed in the future. Without endorsing the trial judge’s
    comments regarding the basis for the admission of the parol evidence, we
    conclude that he was entitled to rely upon this evidence in reaching his
    findings of fact about the factual matrix underlying the negotiation of the
    offer to lease: see <i>Dunn v. Chubb
    Insurance Co. of Canada </i>(2009), 97 O.R. (3d) 701 (C.A.), at paras. 33, 34
    (footnote 4).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants next argue that the trial judge erred by
    making a finding of fraud without stating the basis for that finding and in the
    absence of a pleading of fraud.  In our
    view, the impugned comments in paragraph [54] of the trial judge’s reasons must
    be read together with paragraph [52].  In
    combination, those paragraphs can only reasonably be interpreted as indicating a
    finding that the appellants had misled the respondent by telling him the offer
    to lease he signed was not binding and then taking the position that, in fact, it
    was.  The findings of fact that are set
    out and specifically delineated after paragraph [54] of the trial judge’s
    reasons make this clear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ real argument is that even if there was
    a requirement for a formal lease agreement, the trial judge erred in failing to
    find that this requirement was obviated by the many acts of part performance on
    the part of the respondent giving rise to the creation of a binding tenancy
    agreement.  The appellants rely upon the
    findings of the trial judge that the respondent provided cheques for the first
    and last <span class=SpellE>months</span> rent, provided a letter of credit as
    security, renovated and decorated the premises, held a party for the opening of
    the club, restocked the bar and applied for a business licence and to transfer
    the liquor licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject this argument. The doctrine of part
    performance is not dispositive in this case.  On the trial judge’s factual findings, the respondent was never provided
    with the keys to the main front door of the building and to the leased
    premises.  Moreover, again on the trial
    judge’s findings, on each occasion when the respondent attended at the leased
    premises after the offer was signed, his entrance and exit from the premises
    was controlled by representatives of the corporate appellant. Finally, the
    trial judge accepted that in a memorandum written by the individual appellant
    after the date of the offer, the respondent was informed he would only be given
    the keys to the premises after execution of a formal lease by a set date.  On these facts, there was ample support for
    the trial judge’s credibility-based finding that possession of the premises was
    never provided to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that we were informed that pursuant to the
    Order of Epstein J.A., dated March 11, 2010, the letter of credit was
    surrendered to the bank for cancellation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to his costs of
    the appeal in the amount of $4,500, inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
