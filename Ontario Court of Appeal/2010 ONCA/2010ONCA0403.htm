  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Nav Canada appeals the order of Lax J. of
    the Superior Court of Justice dated 24 December 2009, which approved partial
    settlement in a class action relating to serious aviation accident at Lester B.
    Pearson International Airport on 2 August 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the terms of the settlement between the
    class plaintiffs and the Air France defendants, Air France has agreed to pay
    $10 million plus accrued interest (about $1.1 million) to the class plaintiffs
    in settlement of the claims against them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the terms of the settlement between the
    class plaintiffs and the defendants Airbus S.A.S. and Goodrich Corp., Airbus
    and Goodrich have agreed to pay $1.65 million to the class plaintiffs in
    settlement of the claims against them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further settlement with the defendant Greater Toronto
    Airports Authority for an additional two million dollars has been reached
    pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nav Canada, the only remaining defendant, has not
    reached a settlement with the class plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The settlements include so-called bar orders which
    prohibited further discovery of the settling defendants in the class action so
    as to permit the settling defendants to completely extract themselves as
    parties from the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Broadly speaking, Nav Canada raises two issues on this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Nav Canada contends that the motion judge's
    approval of the bar order component of the settlement agreements will
    improperly prevent the trial court from allocating fault to Air France for its
    &quot;share&quot; of Extra Convention Damages (i.e. damages outside the Warsaw
    and Montreal Conventions) in the course of determining the basic issue at
    trial, namely, Nav Canada’s several liability for Extra Convention Damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The answer to this contention is that there is nothing
    in the motion judge's order that prevents Nav Canada from raising this issue
    before the trial judge. On this point, we agree with the motion judge's
    reasoning at paras. 41 and 42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, neither the settlement agreements nor the
    bar order purport to determine whether class members’ claims represent
    Convention Damages or Extra-Convention Damages for the purposes of NavCan’s
    liability. While the settling parties have agreed to a standard for
    ascertaining the limits of carrier liability for the purposes of settlement,
    they are not attempting to impose the standard on NavCan. The plaintiffs
    undertake to amend the statement of claim to limit the damages sought to those
    that are not available from a carrier under Article 17 of the <i>Warsaw </i>or<i> Montreal Convention</i>. Consequently, NavCan cannot be held liable
    for any damages that are judicially determined to fall within Article 17,
    regardless of whether the settling parties considered those damages to
    constitute Convention Damages for the purposes of the settlement agreements.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The language of the bar order in both settlement
    agreements leaves unresolved as matters for trial these questions: (a) is
    NavCan liable to pay compensation for damages for Extra -Convention damages?
    (b) if so, what is NavCan’s several share of liability for these damages? (c)
    what is the extent of damages for &quot;bodily injury&quot; under the <i>Conventions</i>? Stated in this way, I am
    satisfied that the bar order does not seek to deprive NavCan of any substantive
    defence it has to the allegations of liability for damages or to the manner in
    which &quot;bodily injury&quot; is to be defined. It is also entirely
    consistent with the March 2, 2007 direction of Winkler J. that whether the
    plaintiffs’ claims for damages for psychological injury are recoverable would
    be heard as common issues in the liability portion of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the motion judge stated at para. 47 of her
    reasons that the court would never be asked to apportion of liability for Extra
    Convention Damages between the Air France defendants and the other defendants,
    nothing in the formal order prohibits such an apportionment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, if Nav Canada loses on this argument, the
    loss will come in the trial court. Moreover, the loss will flow from some
    combination of international law (the two Conventions) and domestic law (for
    example, the application of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in<i> Giffels Associates Ltd. v. Eastern Construction
    Co.,</i> [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1346). The loss will not be caused by the bar order in
    the settlement agreements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nav Canada’s second submission is that the bar order’s
    prohibition of further discovery of the settling defendants will greatly
    prejudice its defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. There have already been 24 days of
    discovery in this class action. Crucially, Nav Canada has examined various Air
    France defendants for eight days. Moreover, in four years of litigation Nav
    Canada has not conducted any discovery of the Airbus, Goodrich and GTAA
    defendants. There is also a very comprehensive record relating to the accident,
    in particular the report of the Transportation Safety Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is important to balance the rights of Nav
    Canada, the non-settling defendants, with the rights and interests of the
    settling defendants in class plaintiffs: see <i>Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. v. Propak Systems Ltd.,</i> [2001] A. J. No.
    600 (C.A.), at paras. 24-27, leave to appeal dismissed, [2001] S.C.C.A. no.
    383.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge engaged in this balancing exercise and
    concluded at para. 52:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In considering the interests that must be balanced,
    it is my view that the benefits of the settlement to class members favour its
    approval as it is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the class as
    a whole. Without approval of the bar order, the settlement will fail. This will
    seriously prejudice class members who will be exposed to the costs and risks of
    continuing with the litigation. This prejudice is substantial when measured
    against the prejudice to the procedural rights of NavCan which I regard as
    remote and negligible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis for interfering with this reasoning or
    with the motion judge's exercise of discretion in approving the ‘no further
    discovery’ component of the bar order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed. The respondents are entitled
    to their costs of the appeal fixed as follows: the class plaintiffs-$23,000;
    Air France-$4500; Airbus-$3500; Goodrich-$3500, all inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
