  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Larizza was convicted of 2 thefts over $5,000.  The evidence
    establishing his identity as a party to the two thefts was circumstantial.  It
    consisted largely of expert evidence on the location of his cell phone and that
    of his friend, Robert Chiovitti, during the evenings on which the two thefts
    took place.  That evidence established that the 2 cell phones were in frequent
    contact with each other at the relevant times, were in close proximity and that
    their locations were consistent with the locations of the thefts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in applying evidence on
    each count as similar fact evidence on the issue of identification on the other
    count.  We do not agree.  The Crown did not lead or rely on similar fact
    evidence and the trial judge did not use similar fact reasoning to convict. 
    The trial judge considered the totality of the evidence to reach his
    conclusions that the appellant was a party to both thefts.  There is nothing in
    the reasons to indicate that he relied on the evidence of one count to satisfy
    guilt on another count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do we accept that the verdict was unreasonable. In that regard, we
    rely on para. 43 of the Crown’s factum that:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chiovitti stole Hamby’s motorcycle on Aug. 18 and Joubran’s on Aug.
      20;</p>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chiovitti used an accomplice during both thefts;</p>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was a friend of Chiovitti’s;</p>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chiovitti called the appellant’s phone in the evenings before
      both thefts;</p>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s phone travelled from near his residence to very
      near the locations of the thefts and back to near his residence on the evenings
      of both thefts, generally tracking Chiovitti’s movements;</p>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chiovitti called the appellant’s phone multiple times very near
      the time of the first theft; and</p>
    <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Chiovitti’s phones were located very close to
      the locations of both thefts proximate to both thefts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, it was fully open to the trial judge to find that
    the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the appellant was
    Chiovitti’s accomplice.  We see no basis on which to interfere with the trial
    judge’s findings.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
