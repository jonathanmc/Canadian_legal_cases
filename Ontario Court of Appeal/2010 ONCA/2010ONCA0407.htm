  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I.         OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marjory Cartner suffered a severely broken leg when she
    slipped and fell on a municipal sidewalk while walking to work in Burlington on
    November 8, 2002. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Cartner was walking south on the west side of the
    Guelph Line when she fell. She slipped just as she reached a property on which
    a Speedy Muffler outlet was operating and which was immediately south of<b> </b>the Crystal Shoes Store property owned
    by the defendants Feng Feng Wang and his wife, Ying Jia Huang. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a multi-day trial, Quigley J. concluded that
    Mrs. Cartner’s fall “was caused when her leg twisted and slid out from under
    her as she slipped on a muddy concrete slurry substance that had pooled on the
    sidewalk.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Mr. Wang created the concrete
    slurry the day before Mrs. Cartner fell by washing concrete residue off of his
    property and onto the City’s sidewalk with a water hose. The concrete slurry
    pooled in an area of the sidewalk immediately south of the Crystal Shoes Store
    driveway where three concrete slab sections of the sidewalk sloped westerly
    towards the buildings instead of easterly towards the street like the adjoining
    sections of the sidewalk.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on the respondent’s expert, the trial judge
    found that, absent topographical features to the landscape requiring an
    alternative profile, sidewalks typically slope toward the roadway where
    drainage sewers are located.  The trial
    judge determined that the three reversed concrete slabs were newer than the
    adjoining sections of the sidewalk and that they sloped westerly, towards the
    property, because they had subsided as a result of improper design or construction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to causing the reverse slope of these three
    concrete slabs, the subsidence created differences in the height of the
    sidewalk where the three reversed concrete slabs joined the existing sidewalk. At
    the northern joint, there was a drop in height of 2.5 inches from the existing
    sidewalk to the three reversed concrete slabs (creating a “trip ledge”); at the
    southern joint, the existing sidewalk was about 5/8ths of an inch higher than
    the three reversed concrete slabs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that three factors had the
    combined effect of creating a trap where liquids could pool:  (1) the reverse slope of the three reversed concrete
    slabs; (2) the approximate 5/8ths of an inch height differential at the south
    joint of the three reversed concrete slabs with the existing sidewalk, and (3) the
    presence of grass immediately to the west of the three reversed concrete slabs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge found that the City
    contravened its own sidewalk maintenance policy in 1999, by grinding the 2.5
    inch trip ledge at the north joint of the three reversed concrete slabs with
    the existing sidewalk instead of replacing one or more of the concrete slabs.  In doing so, the City changed the direction
    of the flow of drainage on the concrete slab at the foot of the Crystal Shoes Store
    driveway, causing liquids from that slab to drain towards the trap at the south
    end of the three reversed concrete slabs instead of towards the street.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on all these findings, the trial judge concluded
    that the neighbouring property owners and the City both caused Mrs. Cartner’s
    fall. He held the Crystal Shoes Store owners liable to the respondents both in nuisance
    and in negligence; he held the City liable for failing to comply with its
    statutory duty to keep the sidewalk in a reasonable state of repair. He
    apportioned 80% of the responsibility for the accident to the store owners and
    20% to the City.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City raises two main issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in finding that the sidewalk
    was in a condition of non-repair?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in his causation analysis by
    deciding causation on the basis of “a partial application of the material
    contribution test” and by failing to properly apply the “but for” test?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>

    support the trial judge’s finding that the sidewalk was in a state of
    non-repair and <span class=GramE>that,</span> in any event, the trial judge’s
    finding of non-repair in relation to design and construction is inconsistent
    with his finding concerning drainage.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the trial judge noted, municipalities are not
    liable at common law for non-repair of sidewalks and highways, and the
    respondents’ claim against the City is a statutory cause of action under s.
    284(1) of the<i> Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. M.45.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> However, common law principles of causation apply to the statutory cause of
    action. Accordingly, in order to succeed against the municipality, the
    respondents were required to show that the sidewalk was in a state of
    non-repair under the statute and also that the non-repair was a cause of the
    plaintiff’s injuries, applying the common law test for causation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Subsections 284(1) and (1.1) of the <i>Municipal Act</i> establish the statutory cause of action. At the time
    of the accident, they read as follows:</span></p>
  <p align=left class="Doubleindent-quote" style='

text-autospace:none'>284 (1)  The council of the corporation that has

    of the non-repair and reasonable steps to prevent non-repair). At the time of
    the accident, these subsections read as follows:</span></p>

    drainage and permitted concrete slurry to pool on the three newer concrete

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concerning the design and construction issue, the trial judge
    accepted the evidence of the respondents’ expert, Mr. Pedersen, that the three
    reversed concrete slabs were newer than the adjoining sections of the sidewalk.
    Further, he found that they were sloped in the wrong direction as the result of
    a design or construction flaw. He said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept and find, based on the un-refuted evidence
    of Mr.&nbsp;Pedersen, that the three slab section of sidewalk in front of
    Speedy Muffler and Crystal Shoes was of newer construction than the rest of the
    sidewalk... [B]oth the Ontario [Provincial] Standard for [new] construction and
    common sense make clear that the sidewalk should slope towards the roadway.... It
    was Mr. Pedersen’s opinion that there was inadequate slope both by degree and
    direction. It sloped in the opposite direction, and as my reasons below
    address, regardless of its drainage attributes, its state relative to the older
    abutting sidewalk slabs left at least one trip ledge present that violated the
    City’s own inspection and maintenance standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that the conclusion is inescapable that the
    three slab section was improperly designed or constructed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In finding that the three reversed slabs should slope towards
    the roadway, the trial judge observed that “[t]he roadway was where the
    existing drainage sewers were located.” In addition he said, “<span
class=GramE>the</span> more prudent course of construction so as not to create
    trip hazards ... would likely have been to conform the slope of the new three slab
    section to the same approximate degree in the same direction of slope as the
    older sections of sidewalk that abutted the newly constructed section.”  As there were no unusual topographical
    features that required the sidewalk to slope away from the roadway, the trial
    judge found that it was unlikely that a contractor would intentionally design
    and construct the newer section to slope in this manner.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, in the absence of any evidence of heaving, the trial
    judge concluded that the reversed slope was caused by subsidence. Based on
    evidence adduced at trial, he found that the subsidence occurred due to an
    improperly laid foundation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As for the improper and inadequate grinding repairs issue,
    the trial judge determined that the trip ledge present at the northern joint of
    the three reversed concrete slabs with the existing sidewalk “was at or above
    the 2 ½ inch limit where the City’s policy required that the slabs be replaced”
    and that, “[i]n grinding the edge of that northerly slab of sidewalk, the City
    failed to comply with its own trip hazard policy.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Further, the trial judge concluded that when the City failed
    to comply with its trip hazard policy, it created a new problem: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t changed the direction of the flow of drainage
    at that edge of that sidewalk slab away from the roadway and towards the three
    reverse sloped slabs of sidewalk that lay to the immediate south of it ... That
    changed flow of drainage, combined with the trapping characteristics of the
    three reversed sloped slabs, permitted the pooling of water or other liquids to
    occur on those three slabs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concerning the drainage issue, the trial judge noted that the
    expert witnesses for both parties agreed that there are no statutory
    requirements imposed on a municipality to provide drainage on a sidewalk.
    However, he also noted that the expert witnesses and the City staff witness,
    Mr. Powell, all agreed that pooling, ponding or puddling of water on a sidewalk
    is problematic. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although he acknowledged that he had determined that, as
    against the City, it was the pooling of the concrete slurry on the three
    reversed concrete slabs that was a cause of the accident, the trial judge said,
    “[t]his, however, does not necessarily ... lead to a conclusion that the
    drainage condition of... the three reverse sloped slabs, in and of itself
    constituted a condition of non-repair”.  Instead,
    he concluded, “[i]t is the drainage of water that is the litmus test.”</span></p>

    respondents’ expert, Mr. Pedersen, acknowledged that the Ontario Provincial
    Standard that he relied on was only a guideline and that it was provided only
    to contractors building new sidewalks, read as a whole, his evidence supports
    the trial judge’s conclusion that the slope of the three reversed concrete

    the sidewalk in the vicinity where Mrs. Cartner fell when he visited the site
    on December 21, 2002. None of the City’s witnesses took issue with Mr. Pedersen’s
    measurements. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Pedersen determined that the majority of the older
    sections of the sidewalk sloped towards the roadway at an incline of 1.3% and
    that the property to the west was higher than the sidewalk. The three reversed
    concrete slabs sloped in the opposite direction, towards the property, at an
    incline ranging from 0.5% (the middle slab) to 1.3% (the two outer slabs).</span></p>

    on which he relied was a drawing entitled “typical section” and that it conveys
    a typical representation of the way sidewalks usually slope. Although he
    acknowledged that the drawing does not impose a requirement that sidewalks
    slope toward the roadway, he explained that the Ontario Building Code requires
    that properties be designed so that water flows away from the basement of a
    house. Generally, that results in properties (and sidewalks) being sloped
    toward the roadway. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In addition, Mr. Pedersen confirmed that the drawing he relied
    on reflects a minimum recommended incline of 2% and a maximum recommended
    incline of 4%. The three reverse sloped concrete slabs in issue did not conform
    to these recommendations.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Pedersen gave evidence concerning the relative age of the
    three reversed concrete slabs based on their appearance as compared to the
    appearance of the adjoining slabs. He said that whereas there were obvious
    signs of damage to the adjoining slabs, the three reversed concrete slabs had a
    nicely brushed surface, the edges were neatly trowelled and there was no
    evidence of mechanical damage. He expressed the opinion that three reversed
    concrete slabs were newer than the adjoining sections of the sidewalk. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Pedersen also testified that it “takes some extenuating
    circumstances for sidewalks to either heave or settle.” He said that if a
    sidewalk has settled, it usually means that the bed of the sidewalk has not
    been adequately prepared.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Pedersen confirmed that he took a measurement at the northern
    joint of the three reversed concrete slabs with the pre-existing sidewalk on
    December 21, 2002. He placed a level on the slab of the pre-existing sidewalk adjoining
    the northern reversed concrete slab and measured down from the level to the
    reversed concrete slab and determined the distance was 2.5 inches. Mr. Pedersen
    described scarfing or grinding along the edge of the adjoining slab of the
    pre-existing sidewalk. However, he confirmed that if it were not for the
    scarfing, the difference in height between the two concrete slabs would have been
    2.5 inches. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although he did not measure the height difference at the
    southern joint of the three concrete slabs and the pre-existing sidewalk, Mr.
    Pedersen identified a slight height difference and estimated that it would be
    less than 5/8ths of an inch.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Pedersen testified that any water running down the older
    concrete slab that adjoins the north end of the three reversed concrete slabs
    would tend to run down along the area where the grinding repairs were done and
    onto the reversed concrete slab beside it. The water would then continue along
    the three reversed concrete slabs but, because they were sloped against the
    property, it would tend to collect against the property, against the vegetation
    and dirt. In addition, because the most southerly of the three reversed
    concrete slabs was lower than the older slab beside it, any water flowing onto
    the three reversed concrete slabs would stop at that point until it reached the
    height of the higher slab on the pre-existing sidewalk. </span></p>

    inconsistent with his findings in relation to faulty design or construction of
    the slabs, thus rendering his findings on this latter issue erroneous.  I would not accept this submission.  The trial judge’s findings concerning the faulty

    not repaired, that a trip ledge of 2.5 inches is well over 40 millimetres, and
    that if a trip ledge of 2.5 inches existed City policy required that the

    ledge was repaired. The City was unable to provide an exculpatory explanation
    for the grinding.  In these
    circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to draw an inference based on Mr.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2. Did the trial judge err in his

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>(a)
    The City’s Position on Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City acknowledges that the trial judge accurately
    described the legal test for causation at paras. 14 through 17 of his reasons.
    However, the City submits that the trial judge made two significant errors in
    relation to the issue of causation. First, he concluded incorrectly, at para.
    18 of his <span class=GramE>reasons, that</span> the material contribution test
    for causation applies, at least to some extent, in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, he erred in applying the “but for” test for
    causation by failing to recognize that in order to find the City liable, it was
    necessary that he conclude that “but for” the disrepair of the sidewalk, no
    slurry would have been present on the sidewalk. The City contends that in the
    absence of such a finding, there was no evidence at trial capable of supporting
    a finding that the “but for” test was satisfied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>(b)
    Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the trial judge’s reference to the material
    contribution test, as I read the impugned paragraph, it does nothing more than
    reinforce the trial judge’s earlier correct statement that in order to satisfy
    the “but for” test, a particular cause need only be “a cause” of the injury; it
    need not be the sole cause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impugned paragraph reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is not to say that there is no scope in this
    case for a partial application of “material contribution” concepts within the
    strictures of the principled approach to causation mandated by <i>Resurfice</i> in determining whether either
    or both of these defendants are liable to the plaintiffs. This follows since <i>nothing</i> in <i>Resurfice</i>, or the strong authorities that preceded it, <i>prevents liability from being found against
    a defendant where the defendant’s negligence is found to be “a cause” of injury
    on a balance of probabilities, even if not the ultimate cause.</i> While the
    Supreme Court reaffirmed that “the basic test for determining causation remains
    the ‘but for’ test” and that it applies to multi-cause injuries, in doing so it
    also specifically reaffirmed its decisions in <i>Athey v. Leonati</i> and <i>Snell v.
    Farrell</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I agree that the trial judge’s reference to
    the material contribution test is misplaced, his central point, namely, that a
    particular cause need only be “a cause” of an injury in order to satisfy the
    “but for” test, is correct: see <i>Athey v.
    Leonati</i>, [1996] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 458, at paras. 17-20.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the trial judge’s application of the “but for”
    test, as I read his reasons, he concluded that Mrs. Cartner fell because slurry
    had pooled at the place on the sidewalk where she fell. As discussed above, he
    found that disrepair of the sidewalk contributed to the slurry pooling in two
    ways. First, the reverse slope of the sidewalk, caused by improper design or
    construction, created a trap for liquids at the location where the slurry
    pooled. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the improper grinding repairs caused more slurry
    to run onto the three reversed concrete slabs than would otherwise have been
    the case. The slurry was washed onto the City’s sidewalk from the driveway of
    the Crystal Shoes Store property. Because the City performed improper grinding
    repairs to the concrete slab of sidewalk at the base of the Crystal Shoes Store
    driveway, at least some of the slurry that would otherwise have flowed towards
    the street, flowed instead onto the three reversed concrete slabs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s core findings concerning causation
    read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case the evidence made clear, and I find
    that concrete slurry flowing off of the Crystal Shoes property sometime in the
    24 hour period preceding the accident reached the City of Burlington sidewalk
    and rather than continuing to drain across that northerly sidewalk slab towards
    the roadway, changed its direction of flow. It slowed down the grade created by
    the City’s inadequate trip ledge repairs onto the three reverse sloped slabs
    that abutted that northern slab. And there, apart from a minimal amount of
    drainage that occurred in a south-easterly direction towards the roadway, the
    slurry pooled and remained until the next morning, apparently largely in liquid
    form, retained or trapped by the edge of the north slab and the grassy hill on
    the Speedy Muffler property to the east [<i>sic</i>?].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not need to determine whether the slurry would
    have been present if the sidewalk had not been in a state of non-repair. I do
    not need to determine whether the slurry would have been present if the
    trapping characteristics of the three slab reverse sloped section of sidewalk
    had been properly designed and constructed. I do not need to determine whether
    the slurry would have been present if the City had repaired the trip ledge in
    compliance with its own policies. <i>The
    simple observable fact is that these conditions of non-repair, conditions that
    the City knew existed, created a sidewalk condition that permitted the concrete
    slurry to become trapped when it pooled on the sidewalk. It was the accumulation
    of that slurry in that location that was caused by the condition of non-repair
    of the sidewalk that caused Mrs. Cartner to slip and fall.</i> While I accept
    the proposition that the state of repair of the sidewalk was not “the” cause of
    her fall, it was clearly a cause, and as such, the City is <i>prima facie</i> liable to Mrs. Cartner for her injuries, along with
    Feng Feng Wang and Ying Jai Huang, unless the statutory defences accorded to it
    under the <i>Municipal Act</i> relieve it of
    liability. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On these findings, it was not necessary that the trial
    judge conclude that no slurry would have been present on the sidewalk to hold
    the City liable. The trial judge found that Mrs. Cartner fell because slurry
    had pooled on the sidewalk and that the non-repair of the sidewalk was a
    contributing cause of the pooling. These findings were sufficient to satisfy
    the “but for” test of causation. But for the non-repair, the pooling would not
    have occurred. But for the pooling of slurry, Mrs. Cartner would not have
    fallen in the location and in the manner that she did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it may be interesting to note that Mrs.
    Cartner did not fall on the portion of the City’s sidewalk at the base of the
    Crystal Shoes Store property, it was not necessary for the respondents to rely
    on that fact or to lead complex accident reconstruction evidence to try and
    demonstrate that Mrs. Cartner would not have fallen had the state of non-repair
    not existed. The findings made by the trial judge were sufficient to meet the
    “but for” test of causation.</p>
