  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 22, 2010, the Court released its decision
    dismissing MFN’s appeal from the judgment of Gans J. dated September 15,
    2008.  In his judgment, Gans J. dismissed
    MFN’s claim to be entitled to 35% of the net profits of Casino Rama, in
    perpetuity, as well as to a portion of the gross revenues representing its
    share of operating compensation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties have now filed their written submissions
    respecting the costs of the appeal.  We
    have reviewed those submissions and this is our decision in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the successful respondents, the Chiefs of
    Ontario and Ontario First Nations Limited Partnership, counsel seek costs on a
    heightened scale in light of what they refer to as the unusual features of the
    case and its exceptional complexity and the volume of the trial record.  They ask for full indemnity costs in the
    amount of $534,115.13 ($490,189.35 for fees and $43,925.78 for disbursements)
    or alternatively substantial indemnity costs in the amount of $390,343.57
    including the foregoing disbursements.  In the further alternative, their claim is for $274,973.56 including
    disbursements on a partial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The successful respondent, Ontario, claims costs of
    $118,828.93 (fees of $116,778.50 and disbursements of $2,050.42) on a partial
    indemnity basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFN and OFNLP base their arguments for costs on a
    heightened scale on what they assert were (a) MFN’s inappropriate conduct
    respecting the appeal, (b) its failure to accept an equitable offer to settle
    at trial that would have benefitted all First Nations, and (c) its reasonable
    expectation to pay higher costs if it lost on appeal.  The “inappropriate conduct” submissions are
    founded on (i) the conclusion of both Gans J. and this Court that MFN did not
    have a subjective belief that it had the contract alleged (i.e., it advanced a
    case it didn’t believe in itself, say the respondents), (ii) MFN’s “scorched
    earth tactics” in unsuccessfully attacking more than 100 of the trial judge’s
    findings of fact, and (iii) MFN’s shifting theory of the case that the
    respondents had to meet.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded this is a case for costs of the
    appeal to be awarded on a higher scale than partial indemnity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, we do not think that MFN’s failure to accept an
    offer to settle that expired during trial is particularly relevant to the
    appeal.  No offer to settle prior to the
    appeal has been brought to our attention.  Secondly, MFN’s counsel accept that MFN is obliged to pay significant
    costs on the appeal, but they submit that those costs should be on a partial
    indemnity basis and fixed in an amount considerably less than that claimed by
    the respondents (they have in mind an award of $80,000.00 inclusive of
    disbursements).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core of the argument for a heightened scale of
    costs revolves around the very significant amounts at stake, the length and
    complexity of the matter (and the aggravation of that factor by MFN’s detailed
    and ultimately unfounded attack on the whole of the trial judge’s decision),
    and MFN’s shifting theories of liability throughout.  While we accept that counsel for the
    respondents were compelled to respond in great detail to MFN’s approach to the
    appeal – with the attendant expenditure of time and legal expertise that
    response entailed – we do not think that MFN’s approach constituted the type of
    “reprehensible, scandalous or
    outrageous conduct on the part of one of the parties” called for to
    warrant a full or substantial indemnity award of costs: <i>Young v. Young</i> (1993), 108 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 193 (S.C.C.), at
    p. 283.  See also, <i>Foulis v. Robinson</i> (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> we do accept that
    the factors referred to above justify a robust award based on a partial
    indemnity basis.  The appellants point
    out that some of the hourly rates claimed with respect to counsel for the Chiefs
    and OFNLP with less than 10 years experience exceed those suggested by the
    Notice to the Profession issued on behalf of the Rules Committee.  They also submit that a disbursement in
    excess of $30,000 for consulting fees and other disbursements associated with
    maintaining the electronic record for the appeal is excessive.  We are prepared to make some allowances based
    upon those submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to all the circumstances, we fix the
    costs of the appeal in favour of the Chiefs of Ontario and OFNLP in the amount
    of $250,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and GST.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Ontario was a defendant in the case, it made
    no claim to any of the proceeds of the casino and the <i>lis</i> was primarily between MFN and all of the other Ontario First
    Nations.  Ontario’s role on appeal was
    therefore limited and its submissions more or less mirrored those of the Chiefs
    and OFNLP.  We do not accept MFN’s
    submission that the Crown should not be entitled to any costs of the appeal,
    however.  Ontario was required to prepare
    for and to defend its position, nonetheless.  As with the Chiefs and OFNLP, we have no doubt that preparation was
    extensive.  We therefore fix costs in
    favour of Ontario in the amount of $75,000.00 all inclusive.</p>
