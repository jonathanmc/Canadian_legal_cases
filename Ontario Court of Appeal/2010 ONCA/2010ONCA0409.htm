  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the order of Marrocco J. dated
    September 28, 2009 dismissing the appellant’s application for a declaration
    that the trustees of the <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span> Real Estate
    Investment Trust (“<span class=SpellE>InterRent</span>”) had been removed from
    office by the delivery of the written consents of <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> holding a majority of the units.  For the
    reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> Value partners Inc. (“<span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span>”), claims to be the
    largest holder of units in <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span>, a publicly
    traded real estate investment trust.  <span
class=SpellE>InterRent</span> was formed by a Declaration of Trust dated
    October 10, 2006 and amended and restated on June 29, 2007 (the
    “Declaration”).  It is in the business of
    investing in income-producing multifamily residential properties and owns some
    4000 apartment suites.  Its units, of
    which there are over 19 million, are traded on the Toronto Stock exchange.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2008, <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span> was experiencing cash flow problems.  It
    retained Scotia Capital Inc. as a financial advisor and struck a special
    committee to explore options.  <span
class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> made a proposal to the trustees that would have
    raised $6 million and would have required changes in the Declaration to permit
    higher debt levels.  However, Scotia
    Capital Inc. recommended that the trustees accept a proposal from CLV Group
    Inc. (“CVL”) that would result in a private placement <span class=GramE>raising</span> between $8 and $14 million through the sale of units, a reconstituted board of
    trustees and a new property management agreement.  The trustees accepted the CLV proposal on
    July 23, 2009, and on July 27, 2009 ratified the execution of the CLV Term
    Sheet which reflected CLV‘s proposal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary to set out all the various efforts
    of <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> to forestall the implementation of the
    private placement.  I summarize only the
    efforts that are important to this proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to prevent the trustees from closing the
    private placement, on August 13, 2009 <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> delivered written consents of <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> removing
    all of them from office.  It relied on s.
    9.6 of the Declaration, which provides that trustees may be removed from office
    “by the written consent of the <span class=SpellE>Unitholders</span> holding in
    the aggregate not less than a majority of the outstanding Units entitled to
    vote thereon.”  The respondents disputed
    the validity of <span class=SpellE>NorthWest’s</span> delivery of written
    consents.  In order to meet those
    objections, <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> delivered written consents
    again on August 18, 2009 and on September 1, 2009. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To support its efforts to obtain written consents
    representing a majority of outstanding units, <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> requested an updated list of <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> from <span
class=SpellE>InterRent</span>.  It
    alleges that <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span> and its trustees improperly
    refused to provide the list. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> applied for an
    injunction on August 26, 2009 to restrain the closing of the private placement.  Strathy J. dismissed that application on
    September 3, 2009, and the private placement closed later that day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This application proceeded before Marrocco J. on
    September 24, 2009.  The appellant
    requested the following  relief:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)        <span class=GramE>a</span> declaration
    that the trustees of <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span> were removed as of
    August 13, 2009 or August 18, 2009 or September 1, 2009;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       <span class=GramE>a</span> declaration that the trustees did
    not have the authority to close the private placement which was the subject of
    the three earlier proceedings;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     <span class=GramE>a</span> declaration that the private <span
class=SpellE>placees</span> cannot vote at a meeting of the <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> scheduled for September 30, 2009;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(iv)      <span class=GramE>an</span> order convening an annual and
    special meeting of the <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> on September 30
    excluding the respondents and the private <span class=SpellE>placees</span>;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(v)       a declaration that the trustees and the current management not
    take any steps out of the ordinary course of business except to facilitate an
    annual and special meeting of the <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span>;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(vi)      <span class=GramE>a</span> declaration that the trustees
    breached their fiduciary duty by interfering with the applicant’s efforts to
    obtain updated <span class=SpellE>unitholder</span> lists;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(vii)    <span class=GramE>a</span> declaration that the trustees are not
    entitled to any indemnity for their costs;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(viii)   <span class=GramE>an</span> order approving the appointment of an
    interim trustee;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(ix)      <span class=GramE>an</span> order setting aside double up
    compensation units; and finally,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(x)       <span class=GramE>an</span> order that
    the trustees pay $10 million in compensation to the applicant.</span></p>
  <h3>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>APPLICATION JUDGE’S REASONS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the trustees’ decision
    to accept the CLV proposal instead of the <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> proposal was made in good faith and reflected their business judgment as to
    which proposal was better.  He also found
    that by accepting the CLV proposal and ratifying the execution of the CLV Term
    Sheet, the trustees had explicitly agreed that the private <span class=SpellE>placees</span> would be entitled to vote at the next annual meeting.  Both of these decisions were made prior to <span
class=SpellE>NorthWest’s</span> first delivery of written consents to remove
    trustees.  When these decisions were
    made, on July 27, 2009 at the latest, there was no question about the power of
    the trustees to make them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found it unnecessary to resolve
    the quarrel as to which written consents were valid and effective.  He concluded that, even if the consents were
    valid, they did not immediately remove the trustees from office.  He reasoned that if there were no trustees
    then no one would legally own the trust property and no one could conduct any
    activities on behalf of the trust.  This
    would create particular problems because <span class=SpellE>InterRent’s</span> units were publicly traded.  He observed
    that “[c]<span class=SpellE>ourts</span> should interpret <span class=SpellE>constating</span> documents such as Declarations of Trust in a way that avoids illogical results.”  The application judge read the Declaration to
    contemplate only one situation where there could be no trustees, and that was
    where all the trustees have resigned.  Therefore, assuming that the written consents were valid, the
    application judge found that the effect was that the trustees were not
    immediately removed but continued in office until new trustees were elected by
    the <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge added, however, that if <span
class=SpellE>unitholders</span> holding a majority of the outstanding units had
    indeed consented to remove all the trustees, “those Trustees should, until they
    are replaced, confine themselves to making decisions arising in the ordinary
    course of business and should do whatever is necessary to facilitate the
    holding of a meeting of the <span class=SpellE>Unitholders</span> intended to
    clarify those persons who are Trustees of <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span>.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Continuing his analysis on the assumption that the
    consents were valid, the application judge concluded that the trustees had only
    made decisions in the ordinary course of business since their status was first
    called into question.  Their decision
    fixing a Record Date was a decision made in the ordinary course of the business
    of the trust.  More importantly, the
    application judge concluded that the closing of the private placement on
    September 3, 2009 was also an action in the ordinary course of business.  When the trustees closed the private
    placement they were merely carrying out their July 27 decision to ratify the
    CLV Term Sheet. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though not necessary for his analysis, the application
    judge then commented on the parties’ dispute as to whether the written consents
    delivered by <span class=SpellE>NorthWest</span> were valid.  He was inclined to the view that the August
    13 consents were not valid.  He then
    remarked that the trustees had provided no satisfactory explanation for the
    failure to provide an updated list of <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> to <span
class=SpellE>NorthWest</span>.  Noting
    that the failure to provide the list had prejudiced <span class=SpellE>NorthWest’s</span> efforts to deliver an effective consent to the removal of the trustees, the
    application judge stated that he would have concluded that <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span> and its trustees were <span class=SpellE>estopped</span> from asserting that
    the number of units outstanding on August 18, 2009 differed from the figure
    outstanding on August 13, 2009.  He
    stressed, though, that he was not making a finding that the trustees had
    breached a fiduciary duty by not producing the list.  Whether the trustees had breached a fiduciary
    duty by not producing the list was an issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge next decided that he would not
    appoint an interim trustee.  On the
    assumption he had the necessary jurisdiction, he saw no reason to do so because
    of his conclusion that the trustees had acted within the ordinary course of <span
class=SpellE>InterRent’s</span> business throughout the period that their
    status was in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge directed a trial of all remaining
    issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the application judge refused the
    applications for declarations that the trustees were removed by the written
    consents, did not have the authority to close the private placement on
    September 3, 2009, or may not take any steps outside the ordinary course of
    business.  He also refused the application
    for a declaration that the private <span class=SpellE>placees</span> could not
    vote at the <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> meeting on September 30,
    2009, refused to appoint an interim trustee, and refused to order the convening
    of an annual and special meeting of the <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> on September 30, 2009 excluding the respondents and the private <span
class=SpellE>placees</span>.  He directed
    a trial of the following issues: whether the trustees breached their fiduciary
    duties by interfering with <span class=SpellE>NorthWest’s</span> efforts to
    obtain an updated <span class=SpellE>unitholder</span> list, whether the trustees
    were entitled to be indemnified for their costs, and <span class=GramE>regarding  the</span> double up compensation units and
    Northwest's claim of $10 million in compensation.</p>
  <h3>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ISSUE </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant suggests that the only issue that needs
    to be determined on appeal is whether the written consents, if valid, had the
    effect of immediately removing the trustees from office.  The question of the validity of the consents,
    it suggests, can be left for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the primary issue to be considered is whether
    it is suitable or necessary for this court to determine this question.  For the reasons below, I conclude that it is
    not. </p>
  <h3>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ANALYSIS </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The position of the appellant is that the written
    consents had the effect of immediately removing the trustees from office.  The appellant points out that s.  9.6 of the Declaration provides that the
    trustees may be removed from office “by the written consent of the <span
class=SpellE>Unitholders</span> holding in the aggregate not less than a
    majority of the outstanding Units entitled to vote thereon”, and that s. 9.5(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>ii) provides that a trustee ceases to hold office when “he
    or she is removed in accordance with Section 9.6”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not find the Declaration quite so
    straightforward.  Section 9.6, which
    bears the heading “Removal of Trustees”, sets out the three ways in which
    trustees may be removed: first, <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> may
    remove trustees by resolution at a meeting of <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span> by a majority of votes cast at a meeting; second, trustees may be removed by
    the written consent of a majority of <span class=SpellE>unitholders</span>; and
    third, trustees may be removed for cause by resolution passed by not less than
    two-thirds of the remaining trustees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After setting out the three ways in which trustees can
    be removed from office, s. 9.6 then goes on to provide that “[a]<span
class=SpellE>ny</span> removal of a Trustee shall take effect immediately
    following the aforesaid vote or resolution”.  The only “vote” aforesaid in the section is the vote of a majority of <span
class=SpellE>unitholders</span> cast at a meeting.  The only “resolution” aforesaid in the
    section is the resolution of two-thirds of remaining trustees removing a
    trustee for cause.  While the removal of
    trustees by written consents is mentioned earlier in the section, this sentence
    does not state that such removal has immediate effect.  The ordinary literal construction of s. 9.6
    is that it provides that the removal of trustees by vote or resolution takes
    effect immediately, but s. 9.6 does not deal explicitly with the question when
    removal by written consents takes effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 9.5(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) does indeed
    provide that a trustee ceases to hold office when removed under s. 9.6.  However, one could also observe that s. 9.5(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span><span class=SpellE>i</span>) provides that a trustee
    ceases to hold office when he or she resigns.  Yet s. 9.5(b) makes perfectly clear that resignation of a trustee is not
    effective immediately.  A trustee must
    give a minimum of 30 days notice of resignation.  And a resignation that would destroy a quorum
    does not become effective until the resigning trustee is replaced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that the provisions on which the
    appellant places the greatest reliance do not, by themselves, dictate the
    conclusion that written consents removing trustees from office take effect
    immediately.  A careful consideration of
    the Declaration as a whole would be necessary to determine that question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such a consideration is neither necessary nor suitable
    in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not suitable because the question whether written
    consents under s. 9.6 of the Declaration have the legal effect of immediately
    removing trustees from office is hypothetical.  There is as yet no factual finding that written consents of <span
class=SpellE>unitholders</span> holding a majority of units purporting to
    remove all trustees were indeed filed.  The appellant does not suggest that the application judge erred by
    leaving that issue to be determined at the trial of issues that he
    directed.  It is not the role of this
    court to determine questions that may or may not arise at an impending trial,
    depending on the findings of fact that will be made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> <span
style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> It is not necessary because the real point of
    contention in this appeal is whether the trustees acted within the ordinary
    course of business when they closed the private placement on September 3,
    2009.  That is the real point of
    contention because the appellant argued in this court that the trustees, after
    being immediately removed from office by the written consents, would continue
    to hold legal title to the trust assets with the limited power to act only in
    the ordinary course of business.  In
    advancing this argument, the appellant recognized the central aspect of the
    application judge’s reasoning – that it is necessary that someone hold title to
    the trust property.  That necessity
    prompted the application judge to interpret the Declaration so that any
    trustees removed by written consents would continue to occupy office until they
    were replaced.  He went on to state that
    the removed trustees, until they were replaced, should confine their decisions
    and acts to the ordinary course of business.  The common ground between the appellant’s contention and the findings of
    the application judge is that, after the delivery of valid written consents,
    the trustees should confine their decisions and acts to the ordinary course of
    business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that when the trustees
    decided on September 3, 2009 to close the private placement, they were simply
    implementing a decision that had been made earlier.  He also found that the implementation of a
    decision already made constituted acting within the ordinary course of <span
class=SpellE>InterRent’s</span> business.  This conclusion of the application judge is amply supported by the
    record.  The CLV Term Sheet which the
    trustees ratified on July 27, 2009 provided that the “closing is not subject to
    further approval of the board of trustees of [<span class=SpellE>InterRent</span>]”.  None of the other provisions in the private
    placement documentation relied on by the appellant persuade me that the
    application judge erred in determining that the trustees were contractually
    bound to close the private placement.  In
    good faith they had contractually bound themselves to close the transaction
    before their authority was attacked by the written consents.  Their good faith decision is deemed to be
    “final and conclusive and…binding upon the Trust and all <span class=SpellE>Unitholders</span>”
    by section 10.9 of the Declaration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It is worth
    adding that, at the very <span class=GramE>least,</span> failing to close the
    private placement would have exposed <span class=SpellE>InterRent</span>,
    already in a precarious financial position, to a potentially devastating law
    suit.   Preserving the trust assets from
    the risks inherent in such litigation would fall within the scope of the ordinary
    course of business. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the written consents, assuming they
    were valid, did not prevent the trustees from closing the private placement on
    September 3, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same reasoning applies to the trustees’ decision to
    permit the new private <span class=SpellE>placees</span> to vote at the <span
class=SpellE>unitholder</span> meeting scheduled for September 30, 2009.  The decision of the trustees to permit them
    to vote was taken prior to the delivery of the first batch of written consents
    to remove trustees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons I would decline to embark on an
    unnecessary construction of the Declaration to determine when written consents
    to remove trustees under s. 9.6 of the Declaration become effective in removing
    the trustees from office.</p>
  <h3>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal and award the respondents
    costs fixed in the amount of $25,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
