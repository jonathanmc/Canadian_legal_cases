  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a constitutional case.  However, the tensions between two important,
    and sometimes competing, values in Canadian society underlie the issues to be
    determined.  Those values are the protection
    of children from sexual abuse and exploitation through child pornography (a s.
    7 <i>Charter</i> protected value), and the
    right to freedom of thought and expression (a s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> protected value).  The tensions between them arise from the need to determine the meaning
    and scope of the child pornography defences found in s. 163.1(6) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> – as those defences
    existed in their different forms before and after the amendments on November 1,
    2005.  That is what this appeal is about.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Katigbak was charged with one count of possession
    of child pornography, collected over a 7-year period between 1999 and
    2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, he admitted that the 628 images and 30 video
    clips found on his computer hard drive constituted child pornography, as
    defined in s. 163.1(1) of the <i>Code</i>.  The only issue was whether he was entitled to
    rely upon the defences contained in s. 163.1(6) as they existed at the relevant
    times.  Prior to November, 2005 the
    relevant portions of the defences would have arisen where the possession of
    child pornography had “artistic merit” or an “educational purpose”; there was
    also a “public good” defence imported from the obscenity provisions of s.
    163.  Following the decision in <i>R. v. Sharpe</i> [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, which
    had interpreted the then s. 163.1(6), Parliament amended the <i>Code.  </i>The defences were recast in the form of a two-part, legitimate
    purpose/harm-based test requiring that the act of possession have a “legitimate
    purpose relating to art or education” and that it “not pose an undue risk of
    harm to persons under the age of eighteen years.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge resolved those issues in favour of the
    respondent and acquitted.  The Crown
    appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the acquittal and register a conviction on the offence charged.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts as found by the trial judge are not seriously
    in dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, who was 31 years old at the time of
    trial, is a photographer and has artistic interests.  He has a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, earned
    in 2001.  He worked for several years at
    Japan Camera and later at Pentax Canada until he was eventually laid off.  In 2007 he started his own photography
    business.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Child Pornography Seized </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 19, 2006, the police attended at the
    respondent’s residence and, with his permission, seized his computer and an
    external hard drive.  It is agreed that
    628 images stored on the hard drive were images of child pornography, as
    defined in the <i>Criminal Code.  </i>Sixty-one of these images were duplicates;
    567 were unique images.  All are images
    of real children and real abuse.  In
    addition to these images, there were 30 video clips portraying pre-pubescent
    children that were also agreed to be child pornography.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The images comprised a wide variety of child
    pornography.  There are images of
    children engaging in sexual activity with other children.  There are images of adults (both male and
    female) engaging in such activities with children.  There are images of penetration of children
    (including babies) both anally and vaginally and of children posing in various
    forms of genital exposure.  These images
    are graphically described in the Crown’s factum.  I do not find it necessary to describe them
    more fully here.  Suffice it to say, they
    are repulsive in the extreme to anyone who cares about children and the
    protection of children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the evidence disclosed that there were more
    than 46,000 images of adult pornography stored on the respondent’s computer.  He admitted that 11,200 of these images were
    accessible by any computer user with a minimum of effort.  The adult pornography images were accessed,
    at least partially, for his “personal entertainment.”  He conceded that the child pornography images
    were intermingled – “clumped together” – with the images of adult pornography
    in the way that they were stored on the computer.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Explanation and Defence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent gave an explanation for his possession
    of the child pornography, however.  He
    testified that he started working on a child abuse project because he was not
    completely satisfied with the commercial type of photography he was doing.  He wanted to do something of deeper meaning
    and with a greater artistic challenge.  He was from a large family and had strong feelings for family and the
    protection of loved ones.  His ultimate
    goal was to create a gallery exhibition that would present the issue of child
    exploitation and pornography from the perspective of the exploited child.  Collecting child pornography, he said, would
    allow him to determine what kind of child pornography “was out there” and to
    explore his own emotional response to viewing the material.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Harris has succinctly summarized the respondent’s
    explanation of his project – and his defence – at para. 9 of his factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary, the images were collected
    not to use directly themselves, as the Respondent realized he could not show
    anything graphic in a public exhibition.  The images were gathered to research what child pornography looked like
    and then explore his emotional response to it.  The ultimate goal was a gallery exhibition which would look at child
    exploitation and pornography from the standpoint of the child.  He wanted the viewer to put themselves into
    the shoes of the child to understand the stress and fear and anger they would
    feel.  The viewer would walk away with a
    better understanding of what was happening to the child.  The environment in the gallery would be very
    dark, with children’s choirs and children singing a cappella and nursery rhymes
    in the background.  He was going to
    acquire children’s dolls and child mannequins to display as part of the
    exhibit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted this explanation.  Her findings are not directly challenged on
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Other Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent relied upon the evidence of a friend and
    one-time co-worker, Stacey Tyler, together with certain entries in three
    notebooks he produced, in support of his explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Tyler testified that in the course of their
    friendship, she and the respondent talked about different artistic projects
    they wanted to work on.  One was a
    project that had to do with “society and sort of [the] evil aspects of society”.  In particular, she testified that she
    recalled a discussion with the respondent on an occasion when they were passing
    by a store window containing a collection of undressed children’s
    mannequins.  They talked about wanting to
    photograph them and about their disturbing nature.  However, although child abuse was a “theme”
    they discussed, the respondent never explicitly talked to her about a project
    relating to sexual abuse of children, nor did he ever mention that he was
    collecting child pornography as part of such a project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent produced three notebooks from the years
    2000, 2001 and 2003, containing various doodles, sketches and notes from his
    university classes, shopping lists, schedules and other items.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2000 notebook includes several notations suggesting
    possible projects, including projects featuring child abuse and child
    pornography.  For example, one notation
    stated: “how do you do a show on child porn? (you can’t show it) maybe do a
    documentary … models should show a broken spirit, fear, helplessness, show a
    child w/ an adult in the background (looming) or doing up his pants after the
    abuse has occurred.”  In another place,
    the respondent wrote: “How do you show the mental state of the victim.  Maybe instead of showing actual abuse taking
    place, show an implication of what is going to happen.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the 2001 notebook, under a question about how to
    protect children, the respondent drew a child holding a sign with the word,
    “target.”  The words beside this image
    are “Kids holding signs: e.g. target, use me, victim, nobody, freebee …”  There is also a sketch indicating that a
    child could be depicted as a “small” subject against a large dark background.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the 2003 notebook there are four pages of notes
    containing ideas for depicting images of child sexual abuse.  The notations refer to using mannequins, and
    to children being treated as material objects.  For example, “show fear and oppression”.  There are notes about using sepia tones, a montage and out-of-focus and
    enlarged eyes of the victim to show fear.  And statements like: “Viewers should be too saddened to cry; too shocked
    to be angered … Analogies: meat, materials, anything that is owned, image of a
    meat market … Nothing should be very (blatantly) visible, images should
    encourage the viewers’ imagination to run wild w/ fear and compassion. … Images
    should express the emotions that the victim goes through … involving the
    viewer, it should be psychologically traumatizing, force the viewers to think
    (&amp; take a stand).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent has never taken any further positive
    steps to create or to present any such exhibition.  He was financially unable to rent the space
    to do so, he said.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Child Pornography Crimes and the Defences
    Existing Before and After November 1, 2005</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 163.1(4) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> makes it a crime to possess any child
    pornography.  The crime has not changed,
    although the sanctions for it and the defence available have.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 163.1 has consistently featured an exemption
    for certain conduct that would otherwise be an offence under the section.  As it relates to the arts and education, at
    least, the defence is designed to balance the competing societal values referred
    to above, namely, the protection of children from exploitation and abuse, and
    freedom of thought and expression.  The
    importance of the latter value cannot be gainsaid and is eloquently summarized
    by Chief Justice McLachlin in <i>Sharpe</i>,
    at para. 25:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The right conferred by
    s. 2(b) of the Charter embraces a continuum of intellectual and expressive freedom
    – “freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression”.  The right to possess expressive material is
    integrally related to the development of thought, belief, opinion and
    expression.  The possession of such
    material allows us to understand the thought of others or consolidate our own
    thought.  Without the right to possess
    expressive material, freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression would
    be compromised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time, however, the Supreme Court recognized
    the importance of protecting children in society.  At para. 22, the Chief Justice said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nevertheless, freedom
    of expression is not absolute.  Our
    Constitution recognizes that Parliament or a provincial legislature can
    sometimes limit some forms of expression.  Overarching considerations, like the prevention of hate that divides
    society as in Keegstra … or the prevention of harm that threatens vulnerable
    members of our society as in in Butler … may justify prohibitions on some kinds
    of expression in some circumstances.  Because of the importance of the guarantee of free expression, however,
    any attempt to restrict the right must be subjected to the most careful
    scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature and scope of the s. 163.1(6) defences
    changed with the amendments that came into effect on November 1, 2005.  These amendments are the primary focus of this
    appeal.  However, since the time frame of
    the indictment spans a period both before and after November 2005, the
    provisions of the defences, as they existed both before and after the
    amendment, are relevant.  I set them out
    here:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Pre- November 2005</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>163.1(6)         Where the accused is charged with an
    offence under subsection (2) [making or publishing] (3) [distribution] (4)
    [possession] or 4.1 [accessing], <i>the
    court shall find the accused not guilty if the representation or written
    material that is alleged to constitute child pornography has artistic merit or
    an educational</i>, scientific or medical <i>purpose</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>163.1(7)         Subsections 163(3) to (5) apply, with
    such modifications as the circumstances require, with respect to an offence
    under subsection (2), (3), (4) or (4.1).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>163. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       No person shall be convicted of an
    offence under this section <i>if the public
    good was served</i> by the acts that are alleged to constitute the offence and
    if the acts alleged did not extend beyond what served the public good.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       N/A</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)       For the purposes of this section, the
    motives of an accused are irrelevant. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Post-November 2005</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>163.1(6)         No
    person shall be convicted of an offence under this section if <i>the act</i> that is alleged to constitute
    the offence</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       has a <i>legitimate
    purpose related to</i> the administration of justice or to science, medicine, <i>education or art</i>; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       does not pose an <i>undue risk of harm</i> to persons under the age of eighteen years.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, Parliament replaced an artistic
    merit/educational purpose test focusing on the nature of the materials

lang=EN-US>The Pre- November 2005 Defences</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, the trial judge erred in her
    interpretation and application of the pre-amendment s. 163.1(6) defences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent admits to having had possession of child
    pornography during the period 1999-November 2005.  He relies, however, on the “artistic merit”
    and “educational purpose” defences as they existed at that time.  But there are two reasons why he may not do
    so: (1) the materials he possessed had, themselves, neither artistic merit nor
    an educational purpose; (2) the public good defence now raised on appeal was
    not seriously put in play at trial and does not assist him in any event.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Artistic
    Merit/Educational Purpose</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in her interpretation of the
    “artistic merit” and “educational purpose” defences existing prior to November
    2005.  She rejected the Crown’s argument
    that the defences were restricted to the possession of material which itself
    had artistic merit or an educational purpose, concluding instead that the
    defences extended to a consideration of the broader purpose underlying its
    possession.  This interpretation failed
    to give effect to the clear language of s. 163.1(6)(a), as it then
    existed.  Moreover, it was contrary to
    the interpretation given to that provision by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Sharpe</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acknowledged that the Crown`s
    interpretation was supported by the language in the section and by the
    reasoning of the majority decision in <i>Sharpe</i>.  “However”, she was resolute that “any
    consideration of the scope of the statutory defence of artistic merit has to be
    made in the context of the values it exists to protect” – in this case, the
    value of freedom of thought and expression.  After citing the <i>Sharpe</i> defence
    of the need to protect and nurture society’s freedom of thought and expression,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> she concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The statutory defence
    contained in s. 163.1 provides a moral exemption or justification for otherwise
    criminal behaviour.  The need to preserve
    societal values such as the free exchange of ideas and the nurturing of
    artistic or creative thought requires that the defence be construed
    liberally.  The application of the
    statutory defence was not restricted by the court to situations where the
    material in question had been created for one of the enumerated purposes.  The moral exemption was also said to apply to
    scenarios where objectively pornographic material is possessed for a legitimate
    purpose, such as criminal investigations or psychological research.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are a number of difficulties with this
    conclusion, in my opinion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, while it is true that the defences provided in
    s. 163.1 are to be liberally construed,<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> the defences cannot be considered in isolation and out of context.  Yes, their purpose is to protect the highly
    valued notion of freedom of thought and expression in our society.  And, yes, that protection is extremely
    important as the Chief Justice’s statement in <i>Sharpe</i> underscores.  But s.
    163.1 provides defences to a number of criminal offences relating to child
    pornography – in this case, possession of child pornography.  The defences must be viewed in this context,
    in my view, and not in isolation, focusing solely on the importance of freedom of
    thought and expression, as, respectfully, the trial judge appears to have done
    here.  As the Chief Justice said,
    “freedom of expression is not absolute.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge underlined “[t]he need to
    preserve societal values such as the free exchange of ideas and the nurturing
    of artistic or creative thought” (a pressing s. 2(b) value under the <i>Charter</i>), she paid scant attention to
    society’s interest in ensuring the protection of children from sexual
    exploitation and abuse (an equally pressing s. 7 value guaranteeing life,
    liberty and security of the person), as I see it.  The competition between these values is not
    only pertinent to the “public good” exercise under the pre-November 2005
    provision and the “undue risk of harm” provision in the current legislation; it
    must inform the interpretation of the statutory defences as well.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the pursuit
    of a liberal construction of the defences will become an invitation to
    eviscerate the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, while the defences provided in s. 163.1 are
    to be liberally construed, they must still be construed in light of what they
    say and the interpretation given to them in the jurisprudence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the November 2005 amendment, s. 163.1(6)
    provided that “the court shall find the accused not guilty if the
    representation or written material … <i>has</i> artistic merit <i>or</i> an educational …
    purpose” (Emphasis added).  There is no
    reference to the purpose for which the material is possessed.  <i>Sharpe</i> makes it clear that the artistic merit defence is supported where the material
    has “any objectively established artistic value, however small” (at para.
    63).  Yet with respect to the defence of
    “educational, scientific or medical purpose” the majority stated that the
    defence relates to “the purpose the material, viewed objectively, may serve, <i>not the purpose for which the possessor
    actually holds it</i>” and went on to observe that “arguably few medical,
    educational and scientific works would fall within” the defence (at para. 68;
    emphasis added).  Here, the images
    possessed did not themselves have an educational purpose.  I agree with Ms. Bartlett-Hughes that <i>Sharpe</i> does not interpret the defences
    of artistic merit and educational purpose to exempt child pornography that may
    be useful to a person who may be contemplating a future artistic/educational
    endeavour, however ill-defined that contemplated endeavour may be.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Public Good</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge’s reference to the moral
    exemption “[applying] to scenarios where objectively pornographic material is
    possessed for a legitimate purpose, such as criminal investigations or
    psychological research” is a reference to the passage in <i>Sharpe</i> dealing with the public good defence, not with the artistic
    merit or educational purpose defences.  It was this reference that led Mr. Harris to submit on behalf of the respondent
    that the trial judge’s considerations with respect to the pre-November 2005
    defences were more appropriate to the “public good” defence, as it then
    existed, than to the artistic merit or educational purpose defences.  Indeed, he acknowledged that the artistic
    merit defence pertained only to the representation or writing itself and that
    the trial judge “perhaps somewhat inconsistently” found that the pre-2005
    artistic merit defence was available.  He
    also conceded that “in this case, no defence was available arising from the
    material in and of itself, only from the nature of the act of possession.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge mentioned the public good defence in
    her reasons, but only in a passing sense by implication, through a footnote
    reference to <i>Sharpe</i> in relation to
    her “moral exemption” comment cited above.  In fairness to the trial judge, the respondent made no specific submissions
    based upon the public good defence.  I
    would not give effect to this argument – raised now, for the first time, on
    appeal – in any event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Harris submits that, while the artistic merit and
    educational purpose defences related only to the impugned materials, in and of
    themselves, the public good defence could relieve against culpability depending
    on the act of possession.  Section 163(3)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, as it read
    prior to the November 2005 amendments, provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No person shall be
    convicted of an offence under this section if the public good was served by the
    acts that are alleged to constitute the offence and if the acts alleged did not
    extend beyond what served the public good.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This defence was incorporated into s. 163.1 by the
    former s. 163.1(7).  It has received
    little jurisprudential consideration, but was discussed briefly in <i>Sharpe</i>.  There, McLachlin C.J. gave examples of possession of child pornography
    that could serve the public good.  These
    included “possession of child pornography … by researchers studying the effects
    of exposure to child pornography, and by those in possession of works
    addressing the political or philosophical aspects of child pornography” (at para.
    70).  Mr. Harris submits the respondent’s
    ultimate purpose in possessing the images here – i.e., the creation of an art
    exhibit educating the public on the evils of child abuse – was akin to those
    purposes.  The respondent was a
    “researcher” studying the effects of exposure to child pornography and
    addressing the political and philosophical aspects of child pornography, he
    argues.   Or, at least, there was a
    reasonable doubt that he was.  Given the embedded
    societal value of freedom of thought and expression and the imperative to
    construe the s. 163.1 defences liberally, Mr. Harris contends that the public
    good defence supported the respondent’s acquittal with respect to the
    pre-November 2005 possession and, as well, with respect to the post-November
    2005 possession if the “public good” defence is more favourable to the
    respondent.  I shall deal with this
    latter point later in these reasons when addressing the “defective Information”
    argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the respondent was not engaged in “research,” and
    the trial judge wisely made no such finding, in spite of the respondent’s
    attempts to cast himself in that light. “Research” is defined in <i>Webster’s
    Encyclopedic Dictionary<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></b></span></span></a></i> as “a <i>systematic search</i> for facts;
    scientific investigation,” (emphasis added), and in <i>The Oxford English Dictionary<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[6]</span></b></span></span></a></i> as “the act of <i>searching </i>(<i>closely or carefully</i>) for or after a
    specified thing” and as “a search or investigation directed to the discovery of
    some fact <i>by careful consideration or
    study of a subject</i>; a course of <i>critical</i> …<i> inquiry</i>” (emphasis added).  To interpret what the respondent was doing as
    “research” would be to dilute the term of its meaning.  Moreover, the images possessed by the
    respondent were not “works addressing the political or philosophical aspects of
    child pornography” as contemplated in <i>Sharpe</i>.
     They had no value in themselves, and the
    defence did not seek to ascribe any to them.  As I understand Mr. Harris’ submission, it was the art exhibit that was
    going to address the political or philosophical aspects of child pornography.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary details discussed in the section of
    these reasons dealing with “legitimate purpose”, and outlined in paragraph 67 below,
    also bear upon the public good question, and tend to neutralize any argument
    that the respondent would be entitled to succeed on that basis.  Of particular significance is the
    respondent’s admission that where his downloading of the scores of images became
    repetitive, he persisted only in order to “feel like [he] was doing something
    to keep the project going.”  That
    admission underscores the conclusion that the respondent’s act of possession
    here extended well beyond what could reasonably be said to serve the public
    good.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I am satisfied that the respondent was not
    entitled to rely upon the defences provided by s. 163.1 of the <i>Code</i> as it existed prior to the
    amendments in November 2005.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>The Post-November 2005 Defence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am equally satisfied that the respondent was not
    entitled to rely upon the defence provided by s. 163.1(6) of the <i>Code</i> as it presently exists.  The trial judge was mistaken in her
    interpretation and application of the “legitimate purpose” part of that test,
    in my view, but, for reasons that I will explain, I would not allow the appeal
    on that ground.  That is not the end of
    the analysis, however.  The trial judge
    erred in her application of the “no undue risk of harm” part, and, since the
    two components of the s. 163.(6) defence are conjunctive, the acquittal must be
    set aside on that basis.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>The Genesis of the November 2005 Amendments</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to an analysis of the trial judge’s
    treatment of the post-November 2005 defence, however, it may be helpful to
    consider the history and purpose of the amendments made at that time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The November 2005 amendments to the child pornography
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> were
    Parliament’s response to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Sharpe</i>.  In that decision the Court upheld the constitutional validity of the
    then provisions respecting child pornography, subject to the carve-out of two
    exceptional circumstances that in the Court’s view could not be
    constitutionally captured by the provisions.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  In doing so, however, the majority ruled, at
    para. 63, that “artistic merit” encompassed materials displaying “[<i>a</i>]<i>ny</i> objectively established artistic value, <i>however
    small</i>” (emphasis added), and that a community tolerance standard was not to
    be used to assess that threshold.  These
    conclusions sparked considerable public controversy, and many felt that the
    Court had unjustifiably weakened the protection provided by the child
    pornography sanctions in the <i>Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament reacted.  After several abortive attempts, it enacted the November 2005
    amendments.  Instead of resting the defences
    on the “artistic merit” or “educational (scientific or medical) purpose” of the
    materials themselves (as in the previous provisions) as well as the “public
    good,” Parliament settled on a two-part legitimate purpose/harm-based defence,
    i.e., the act alleged to constitute the offence must (a) have a legitimate
    purpose related to the administration of justice or to science, medicine,
    education or art; <u>and</u> (b) must not pose an undue risk of harm to persons
    under the age of eighteen years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some measure of the purpose behind the amendments may
    be gleaned from external materials such as the Parliamentary debates at the
    time of their passage through the House and the Senate, and by considering the
    problem that Parliament sought to overcome: see <i>Reference re Firearms Act</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, at paras. 17 and
    21; <i>Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta</i>,
    [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 27.  For
    example, on second reading in the House the Hon. Paul Harold Macklin
    (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
    Canada) stated:<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Bill C-2 addresses an issue that is foremost on the
    minds of many Canadians, namely <i>the
    protection of children against abuse, neglect and exploitation</i>… Bill C-2
    proposes much welcomed criminal law reforms and addresses five main issues …
    [the Parliamentary Secretary went on to outline those issues, including that
    the Bill “<i>strengthens current provisions
    banning child pornography</i>” and “<i>further
    protects</i> children from sexual exploitation by people who take advantage of
    their vulnerability.  He then continued:]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Canada’s criminal laws against child pornography
    are already among the toughest in the world.  Bill C-2 proposes further reforms that <i>will make these laws even tougher</i>.  Bill C-2 proposes the following child pornography reforms …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It will make the commission of any child
    pornography offence with intent to profit an aggravating factor for sentencing
    purposes, <i>and it replaces the existing
    defences of artistic merit, education, scientific or medical purpose and public
    good with a two-part harm-based legitimate purposes defence.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under this proposed
    reform, <i>a defence would only be available </i>for an act that has a legitimate purpose related to the administration of
    justice, science, medicine, education or art and does not pose an undue risk of
    harm to children.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister of Justice, the Hon. Irwin Cotler,
    addressed the Standing Committee on Justice, Human Rights, Public Safety and
    Emergency Preparation on the amendments.  In his remarks, he stressed on a number of occasions that, in his view,
    the outcome of the <i>Sharpe</i> case would
    have been different had the proposed amendments been in place at the time.  He said:<a

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally Mr. Chairman, Bill C-2 proposes this
    [two]-pronged, harms-based, legitimate-purpose defence in a manner that will
    only be available for an act that has a legitimate purpose related to the
    administration of justice, medicine, education, or art, and as I said does not
    pose an undue risk of harm to children.  Under this test it will not be enough to show some artistic value, as
    was the situation in the Sharpe case.  </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The harm-based

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the Government of the day, therefore, it appears

    child pornography in several respects, and in particular, for purposes of this
    appeal, (c) to narrow the defence available.  While these statements are not determinative, they are helpful in
    assessing Parliament’s intention.  As the

    rather than narrowed, the defence available under s. 163.1(6) because now, even
    if (as is the case here) an accused is found to be in possession of child
    pornography without any pretext of artistic merit or educational purposes in
    itself, an accused person is nonetheless entitled to rely on the purpose of his
    or her possession to escape culpability.  I reject that proposition, however. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The suggestion is clearly contrary to the intention of
    Parliament and, as well, in my view, to the language of the new provision.  By qualifying the word “purpose” with the
    word “legitimate”, Parliament signalled that it was putting limits on the
    defence.  The goal of strengthening the
    child pornography laws and narrowing the defence available was to be
    accomplished by ensuring that <i>any</i> artistic value or educational purpose, however slight, would no longer suffice
    as a defence but, instead, a “legitimate” purpose relating to one of the
    enumerated spheres of valued activity had to be raised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Parliament responded to the Supreme
    Court’s rejection of the community tolerance standard relating to art by adding
    the “no undue risk of harm” criterion.  This was in keeping with Chief Justice McLachlin’s suggestion that
    legislation which did not seek to catch all material that might harm children
    but “only material that poses a reasoned risk of harm to children” was
    constitutionally permissible: <i>Sharpe</i>,
    para. 34.  The art of judging is not
    generally suited to the exercise of attributing community “value” to
    artistic/educational works or endeavours.  But judges are adept at assessing “harm.”</p>
  <p><u>The Contours of the Present s.
    163.1(6) Defence</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The object of s. 163.1(6) is to provide a defence to
    conduct that would otherwise be culpable in the context of child pornography.  The defence is available in circumstances where
    countervailing considerations relating to one of the spheres of valued activity
    – in this case, art and education and the core value of freedom of thought and
    expression underpinning them – warrant such protection..  For convenience, I repeat what s. 163.1(6)
    says :</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndent><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>163.1(6) No person shall be convicted of an offence
    under this section if <i>the act</i> that is

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'> does not pose
    an <i>undue risk of harm</i> to persons
    under the age of eighteen years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read this provision, the defence <i>may</i> be triggered where the otherwise
    culpable act serves an acceptable or justifiable – i.e., a “legitimate” –
    purpose relating to one of the enumerated spheres of valued activity, but then
    only if the act does not pose an undue risk of harm to children.  What makes the act acceptable or justifiable,
    and therefore worthy of protection in law, in the “legitimate purpose” component
    of the analysis, is its objectively verifiable connection with the purpose and
    the ultimate worthy goal.  If the act
    truly contributes to that goal and serves a legitimate purpose in this sense,
    the analysis then turns to “undue risk of harm.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am led to this interpretation for a number of
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point in attributing meaning to the
    language of legislation is the oft-cited principle of statutory interpretation,
    first articulated by Driedger, in <i>Construction
    of Statutes</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> ed. 1983), that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one
    principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their
    entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with
    the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See <i>Sharpe</i>, para 33; <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <i>R. v. McIntosh</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686,
    at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To this I add the important principle of statutory
    interpretation that the provisions of a statute are not to be interpreted in a
    fashion that renders them mere surplusage: <i>R.
    v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 28; <i>R. v. Kelly</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 170, at para. 43.  Parliament’s use of the words “legitimate”
    and “undue risk” must therefore be given meaning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ascribing the foregoing structure and sense to s.
    163.1(6) is in my view consistent with the wording of the amendment, the scheme
    and object of the<i> Criminal Code</i>, and
    the intention of Parliament in enacting it.  </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:
normal'>The Wording of the Amendment</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its ordinary sense, “legitimate” is said to be
    something that is lawful, justifiable, proper or conformable to a recognized
    standard sanctioned by the laws of reasoning.<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[10]</span></span></span></a>  Hence the foregoing characterization of
    legitimate as something that is “justifiable” and, I would say, “acceptable”
    (conformable to a recognized standard …).  At the next level of the analysis, “undue” has been defined as meaning
    “inappropriate,” “unjustifiable,” “excessive,” or “going beyond what is …
    warranted or natural.”<a href="#_ftn11"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[11]</span></span></span></a>  This is consistent with Justice Wilson’s
    observation in <i>Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd
    v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, at p. 524, that harmful and dehumanizing
    material (here, it is conduct) which contributes to “a process of moral
    desensitization”, while in some circumstances acceptable, “must … be controlled <i>when it gets out of hand</i>, when it becomes
    ‘undue’” (emphasis added).</p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Scheme and Object of the Act</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The overriding object of the<i> Code</i> is to govern and sanction the conduct that society sees fit
    to criminalize in a manner that complies with the Canadian constitution.  Reflecting society’s abhorrence of crimes
    that abuse and exploit children, one of the most vulnerable groups in society,
    this criminalization includes conduct relating to child pornography (making,
    distributing, possessing and accessing child pornography are all crimes).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognizing the clash that may arise between these
    offences and other core values in Canadian society (in this case, freedom of
    thought and expression), however, Parliament has developed a scheme that provides
    a statutory defence to such charges in some circumstances.  While the shape of that defence has changed
    with the November 2005 amendments, it remains still an important statutory
    bulwark against the unconstitutional infringement of the s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> value.  At the same time, though, Parliament has determined
    that not all acts relating to education or the arts (or the other enumerated
    spheres of valued activity) in this context will be immune from prosecution in
    the interests of buttressing freedom of thought and expression – only those
    that serve a <i>legitimate</i> purpose will
    be, and then, only those that do not pose an <i>undue </i>risk of harm to minors.  </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Intention of Parliament</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>F</span>inally, through this scheme as described, Parliament has
    demonstrated its intention to control the evils of child pornography as
    effectively as possible while concurrently respecting the value of freedom of
    thought and expression.  This is in
    keeping with the statements made during the Parliamentary debates, referred to
    earlier.  It is also in keeping with the
    view, expressed above, that the s. 163.1(6) defence, while it is to be
    liberally construed, must not be construed in a manner that renders the child
    pornography offences essentially inoperative.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Application
    of the Principles to This Case</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, there is no mystery about the otherwise culpable
    act or about the respondent’s stated purpose or intention.  The act is the possession of images of child
    pornography collected indiscriminately in significant numbers over a period of
    7 years, and stored in the haphazard and insecure fashion described above.  The respondent’s stated purpose or intention
    was to create an artistic/educational exhibit that would raise awareness of the
    effects of child pornography and sexual abuse on children; in this regard, he
    said he was collecting the images to educate himself about “what was out
    there”, and to inspire his creativity in connection with the project.  The trial judge concluded this was a
    “legitimate purpose” and went on to determine, as well, that the respondent’s
    acts of possession posed no undue risk of harm to children. </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Trial Judge’s Narrow Approach to
    “Legitimate Purpose”</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown opted not to attack the trial judge’s finding
    that the respondent had the purpose or intention he said he had, but argued on
    legal grounds that the purpose was not a “legitimate” one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I confess to having serious reservations about the
    trial judge’s finding that the respondent had the purpose or intention he
    espoused, and all the more so with respect to her conclusion that that purpose
    or intention constituted a legitimate purpose.  On the totality of the evidence here, viewed in light of the s. 163.1(6)
    rubric outlined above, it seems to me that a reasonable observer would have
    little difficulty rejecting the respondent’s expressed purpose or intention as
    unreasonable.  Had the trial judge
    assessed the evidence relating to the possession of the pornographic images in
    light of the s. 163.1(6) framework described above, as she should have, I
    believe she would have concluded differently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this respect, I refer in particular to the following

    clips portraying pre-pubescent children and teenagers</p>

    purposes)</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that many of the images and depictions of sexual
    activity between children and adults were generic in nature, in the sense that
    they involved similar images of similar sexual acts, and were therefore
    unnecessary to provide additional insight with respect to the respondent’s
    emotional and creative responses</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:

    stored in a fashion that “clumped [them] together” with the additional 11,200
    accessible pictures of adult pornography also found on the respondent’s
    computer and which, he acknowledged, were viewed for his own “personal
    entertainment”</p>

    download and store the images at all, given his concession that it would only
    take him “a couple of hours” to access sources on the Internet –  which, presumably, could evoke the emotional
    response he sought -- when ready to begin the creation of the exhibit </p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that no steps were taken to bring his
    ill-defined idea to fruition, other than the doodling in his notebooks, between
    2000 and 2003; the respondent said he couldn’t afford to rent space for the
    exhibit, but where were his sketches, drawings and outlines that would have to
    be precursors to the space rental phase?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of all this evidence, which the trial judge did
    not address in any meaningful way, I question whether any reasonable observer
    could conclude the respondent either had the purpose or intention he professed
    to have or that he had possession of the images for a “legitimate” purpose
    related to art or education.  Perhaps
    there was <i>some</i> minimal connection in
    his mind – to create some ill-defined art exhibition at some unknown point in
    time – but on any objective view of the evidence he did not have possession of
    these images in this fashion for that purpose.  In short, his acts of possession belie the legitimacy of his purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were it not for the Crown’s concession with respect to
    the purpose finding – reiterated in the face of specific questions from the
    Court during argument – I would have seriously considered setting aside that
    finding.  However, and even though we are
    not bound by that concession, given that the respondent prepared for and argued
    the appeal on the basis that it had been made, principles of fairness to him
    militate against doing so.  The trial
    judge’s “legitimate purpose” conclusion is rooted in that finding.  Accordingly, in these particular
    circumstances, I would be reluctant to set aside the acquittal on “legitimate
    purpose” grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further observation may be in order, nonetheless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial judges must take a hard look at the facts when
    the legitimate purpose defence is put forward.  Duelling and important societal interests are at stake.  Trial judges must be careful not to be drawn
    easily into accepting beguiling explanations – wrapped in the compelling
    trappings of freedom of thought and expression – that on their face may evoke
    some connection to an otherwise commendable goal.  On an objective review of the evidence, those
    explanations may prove to be merely a façade for some other underlying purpose
    with no actual connection to art or education (or science or medicine).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I repeat that there were<i> </i>many images here – a good number of them duplicates and/or merely
    generic – collected indiscriminately over a period of 7 years, and stored in an
    insecure and irresponsible manner, with nothing to indicate they<i> </i>were related to a project of any
    kind.  The images depicted actual abuse
    of real children.  At least some of these
    images were “clumped together” with an inordinate number of adult pornography <i>imag</i>es that were admittedly accessed by
    the respondent for his own “personal pleasure.”  No consequential steps were taken to pursue the respondent’s proposed
    child abuse exhibition.  The respondent
    admitted that his downloading may have become redundant and that he could have
    accessed the images he needed within “a couple of hours” whenever he was ready
    to create his exhibit.  To hold in these
    circumstances that these acts of possession served a legitimate purpose related
    to art or education would be to provide a licence to anyone to collect and
    store an indefinite number of child pornography images in a totally
    indiscriminate manner over an indefinite period of time on the slightest
    pretext of their connection to some ill-defined, and perhaps never to be
    attempted, artistic/educational project.  That is not what Parliament intended.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I do not propose to interfere with the trial
    judge’s decision on the legitimate purpose component of the s. 163.1(6) defence
    for the reasons set out above.  The
    two-part defence is conjunctive, however, and in my view the respondent fails
    on undue risk of harm grounds.  The trial
    judge erred in holding otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to that issue now.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Undue
    Risk of Harm</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the respondent’s acts of possession had a
    “legitimate purpose related to … art or education,” they will not be protected
    if they posed an “undue” risk of harm to children.  As I have already observed, the scheme of the
    s. 163.1(6) defence demonstrates Parliament’s acceptance that <i>some</i> risk of harm may be justified in
    light of the constitutional imperatives in favour of freedom of thought and expression
    (and other values sought to be preserved by the defence).  But that risk of harm must not be “undue.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the “undue risk of harm” part of s. 163.1(6),
    Parliament has sought to balance – and has directed the courts to weigh in
    individual cases – the value of protecting children from the destructive
    effects of sexual abuse and child pornography, on the one hand, against the
    value of freedom of thought and expression, on the other hand.  Given the ordinary meaning of “undue”
    referred to above, the purpose and object of the legislation and the intention
    of Parliament, I would say that the risk of harm is “undue” in this context
    when society would find that risk of harm inappropriate, unjustifiable,
    excessive or unwarranted in the circumstances of the case.  To adapt the observation of Wilson J. in <i>Towne Cinema</i>, the risk of harm must be
    controlled as undue “when it gets out of hand.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge recognized the need to strike the
    foregoing balance.  Early in her reasons
    she observed that “the scope of the defence itself has been narrowed since the
    court must balance the inherent risk posed by the possession of child
    pornography against the actions of the accused.”  She also recognized the inherent societal
    risks of harm flowing from the possession of child pornography, citing <i>Sharpe</i>, and stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the legislation as it existed at the time
    of the Sharpe decision did not incorporate the balancing test that now exists,
    the court was alive to the inherent societal risks flowing from the possession
    of child pornography.  The court
    concluded that possession of child pornography increases the risk of harm by
    sensitizing those who view the materials to the abuse of children and perhaps
    making them more likely to engage in child abuse.  Pedophiles may become aroused and more likely
    to offend.  The materials can be used to
    groom future victims and finally that there is a risk that the purchase of such
    materials fosters the continued production of them, leading to the ongoing
    abuse of children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See <i>Sharpe</i>, paras. 86-94.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge failed to give effect to those
    risks when it came to determining undue risk of harm in this case.  She rationalized this by relying on a
    distinction drawn by this Court in <i>R v.
    Hawkins</i> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 246, leave to appeal denied [1993] S.C.C.A.
    No. 538.  The distinction differentiates
    between the evidentiary requirements for finding that a limitation on a constitutional
    right may be justified by the potential harm caused by the exercise of that
    right (where the Crown must demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of harm) and the
    Crown’s requirement to prove at trial that the actions of a specific defendant
    pose an undue risk of harm so as to disentitle him to a statutory defence (a
    reasonable doubt exercise).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concluding, correctly, that the final determination has
    to be made in the context of the evidence at trial, the trial judge closed her
    reasoning on the undue risk of harm issue with this statement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[36] In assessing
    whether the actions of Mr. Katigbak posed an undue risk of harm to persons
    under the age of eighteen, I have considered the circumstances of the
    offence.  The works possessed by Mr.
    Katigbak were not purchased by him so the makers of the materials did not
    profit from his viewing of them and the market for such material was not
    encouraged by his actions.  There is no
    suggestion that his interest in the materials was motivated by any sexual
    interest.  The risk that he would become
    desensitized to the issue of child abuse or more likely to offend sexually has
    to be far less in this situation than where the material is collected for the
    purpose of arousal.  It was not his
    intention that the images themselves would ever be distributed or even
    replicated in his exhibit; rather he sought to demonstrate the feelings of
    helplessness and fear experienced by the victims.  This in my mind negatives the concern that
    the victims are being re-victimized by a viewing of the images.  Finally, there was no suggestion that the
    artistic project was to be sexual in nature which would reduce the concern that
    it would provide sexual gratification for others or desensitize others to the
    issue of child abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are several difficulties with these
    conclusions.  First, some of them are
    simply wrong and/or irrelevant.  Secondly, while I accept the <i>Hawkins </i>distinction referred to above, it does not follow that jurisprudential
    findings in constitutional cases are of no assistance, and the trial judge’s
    conclusions ignore the strong statements made by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Sharpe</i> about the various risks and
    dangers of child pornography, some of which she, herself, had earlier
    acknowledged.  Thirdly, the trial judge
    appears not to have given effect to the principle that the harm flowing from
    particular material may be inferred from the nature of the material itself or
    from the material and other evidence: see <i>R
    v. Butler</i> [1992] 2 S.C.R. 452, at para. 59; <i>R v. Hawkins</i>, at p. 263.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion that “[t]he works
    possessed by Mr. Katigbak were not purchased by him so the makers of the
    materials did not profit from his viewing of them and the market for such
    material was not encouraged by his actions” is partially irrelevant and clearly
    wrong.  So, too, is the notion that
    because the respondent did not intend to distribute the images or replicate
    them in his exhibit, the concerns about re-victimization of the children
    through his downloading and viewing of the images were “negatived.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that whether he paid for the downloaded
    images does not detract from the actual harm caused, and it is simply not
    correct to say that the makers of the materials do not profit from his
    downloading and possession of the images just because he did not pay for
    them.  The number of “hits” is important
    in the world of cyberspace.  Each act of
    downloading and possession fuels the demand for the creation of more child
    pornography, whether or not the images or materials are purchased or traded.  Similarly, while the respondent’s intention
    not to distribute or replicate the images may have avoided <i>redoubling</i> the victimization, it did not <i>diminish</i> the re-victimization of the actual children involved
    through the very process of downloading and possessing the images.  These unsupportable findings were central to
    the trial judge’s conclusion with respect to undue risk of harm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well established that possession fuels the market
    and re-victimizes the children in question.  As McLachlin C.J. noted in <i>Sharpe</i>,
    at para. 92:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fifth and final
    harm – the abuse of children in the production of pornography – <i>is equally conclusive</i>.  Children are used and abused in the making of
    much of the child pornography caught by the law.  <i>Production
    of child pornography is fuelled by the market for it, and the market in turn is
    fuelled by those who seek to possess it.</i> … <i>The link</i> between the
    production of child pornography and harm to children <i>is very strong</i>.  The abuse is
    broad in extent and devastating in impact.  The child is traumatized by being used as a sexual object in the course
    of making the pornography.  The child may
    be sexually abused and degraded.  The
    trauma and violation of dignity may stay with the child as long as he or she
    lives.  Not infrequently, it initiates a
    downward spiral into the sex trade.  Even
    when it does not, <i>the child must live in
    the years that follow with the knowledge that the degrading photo or film may
    still exist, and may at any moment be being watched and enjoyed by someone</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings were made by the Supreme Court of Canada
    based on the social science evidence presented in the <i>Sharpe </i>case.  In the absence
    of evidence that the social science has changed, I do not think they can be rejected
    outright, which is what the trial judge effectively did.  Indeed, this Court observed in <i>R. v. Koh</i> (1998 42 O.R. (3d) 668 at
    para. 37 that “judicial notice is permissible where previous courts have proven
    a certain fact”. The Crown is surely not required to lead social science
    evidence in every child pornography proceeding to establish what the Supreme
    Court of Canada has already accepted is the case.  The Crown retains its onus, and must disprove
    the defence and establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, as <i>Butler</i> and <i>Hawkins</i> show,
    it may rely on reasonable inferences that harm flows from certain conduct and on
    inferences that may be drawn from the very nature of the materials or images in
    question themselves or the materials and other evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge swept aside the jurisprudential
    findings asserted in <i>Sharpe</i>;<i> </i>made findings herself that were clearly
    wrong, as discussed above; and failed to consider other important factors such
    as the length of time over which the images were possessed, the indiscriminate
    and insecure fashion in which they were stored and kept, and the risks these
    factors posed for further harm to the children exploited and abused in the
    materials he possessed.  Had she not
    fallen into error in these ways, she might well have come to a different
    conclusion with respect to the “undue risk of harm” part of the s. 163.1(6)
    test.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination of the egregiously pornographic images
    of actual abuse and exploitation of actual children in this case, alone and in
    conjunction with the jurisprudence and other factors referred to above, leave
    little doubt in my mind that the images and the respondent’s acts relating to
    their possession pose an undue risk of harm to children.  To repeat, there were many images, collected
    and stored indiscriminately, insecurely and irresponsibly, over a period of 7
    years.  There was a very real risk that
    other members of the respondent’s family, and friends who came to visit, might
    access the images on his computer.  Those
    images depicted actual abuse of real children, something the law recognizes as
    inherently harmful.  At least some of the
    images were “clumped together” with an inordinate number of adult pornography
    images that were admittedly accessed by the respondent for his own “personal pleasure.”  The respondent acknowledged his downloading
    became redundant and that he could have accessed the images he needed to evoke
    the emotional response he sought within “a couple of hours” whenever he was
    ready to create his exhibit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When this level of harm is weighed against the
    respondent’s stated purpose of gathering ideas for an artistic/educational
    project that was not being pursued actively and, realistically, had little
    prospect of being started, much less completed, I have little difficulty in
    concluding that the risk posed by the respondent’s act of possession in these
    circumstances was inappropriate, unjustifiable and unwarranted – in a word,
    “undue.”  Reasonable members of society
    would not find his act of possession acceptable in all of the circumstances in
    the balancing exercise that the trial judge was required to conduct under s.
    163.1(6). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s analysis was not helped by the
    disproportionate weight she appears to have attributed to the value of freedom
    of thought and expression.  Freedom of thought
    and expression is undoubtedly a core societal value.  But it does not trump all other values: <i>Sharpe</i> at para. 22.  Nor is it sufficient, <i>on its own</i>, to justify elevating the purposes underlying the
    respondent’s act of possession in these circumstances to the level necessary to
    afford him a defence under s. 163.1(6) of the <i>Code</i>.  I am satisfied that
    Parliament intended by its amendment to strengthen the consideration to be
    given to the protection of children in the interpretive exercise of defining
    the scope of the defence provided by s. 163.1(6).  The constitutionality of that choice is not
    at issue here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was very deferential to the freedom of thought
    and expression considerations underlying the defence.  But, it would be a rare circumstance, in my
    opinion, where the possession of child pornography depicting the actual sexual
    abuse of real children – even where the purpose underlying that possession may
    in some “logical” way contribute to the advancement of art or artistic
    education – would not constitute an undue risk of harm to children and
    therefore be justified under s. 163.1(6).  I say this notwithstanding, and without seeking to derogate from, the
    very high importance of freedom of thought and expression in our society.  To permit the purposes articulated by the
    respondent – and accepted by the trial judge – to constitute a defence in the
    context of s. 163.1(6), in the circumstances here, would be to flout the
    recognized risks to society that Parliament has attempted to regulate by
    creating the child pornography offences, and make a mockery of the child
    pornography provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would set aside the trial judge’s findings with
    respect to undue risk of harm  and, with
    that, the acquittal as well .</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Information Was Not Defective</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the respondent raises the argument – for the
    first time, on appeal – that the Information should be quashed because it is
    defective.  It is defective, he submits,
    because the single count in it charges the offence of possession of child
    pornography over a lengthy 7-year period and the defences available to him
    changed substantially during that time.  He
    should have been charged with one count of possession during the period
    preceding the November 2005 amendments and with another count charging
    possession for the period following the amendments until the point of
    seizure.  An amendment of the Information
    on appeal will not rectify the problem, he concludes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 581 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> requires that each count in an indictment in general apply to a single
    transaction.  The count is to contain
    sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence in order to give the
    accused reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be proved
    and to identify the transaction to which it refers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the count in the Information did exactly
    that:  The respondent was charged with
    “[having] in his possession child pornography to wit, graphic computer images”
    over a 7-year period ending on May 12, 2006.  The essential elements of that offence did not change over the years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The available defence did change, and it is true that
    the Information did not differentiate between possession before and after the
    November 2005 amendments.  It is also
    true that the evidence at trial did not establish precisely when the respondent
    came into possession of which images, and therefore what images – and how many
    – were in his possession prior to the amendments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, there is no dispute that the respondent was in
    possession of child pornography during the <i>entire</i> 7-year period covered by the information or that he was in possession of all
    628 images and 30 video clips at the end of the period covered by the
    Information.  Nor is there any dispute
    that the images he possessed – or some but not all of them – constituted child
    pornography as defined in s. 163.1(1).  All
    of them fell into the child pornography category.  That, too, is admitted.  And there is nothing in the evidence to
    suggest that the respondent had any different purpose or objective in mind in
    the pre-November 2005 period than in the period thereafter.  In short, nothing about the defence differed
    in the two periods.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it may have been preferable for the Crown to have
    charged him with two counts of possession – one before November 1, 2005, and
    one for the possession thereafter – I am unable to appreciate how the
    respondent was prejudiced by the Information as it stands.  He and the Crown both proceeded at trial on
    the premise that he was entitled to the pre-amendment defences for the period
    ending October 31, 2005 and to the post-amendment defence for the subsequent
    period.  He was tried on that basis.  Because there is no dispute over the
    pornographic nature of any of the images – whenever possessed – and because
    there is no suggestion that Mr. Katigbak’s purposes or objective changed over
    the entire 7-year period, the only prejudice to him would be if the
    post-amendment defence were more favourable to him and he was deprived of the right
    to rely on that defence for the pre-amendment period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not the case, however.  For the reasons articulated earlier, I have
    concluded that the post-amendment legitimate purpose/harm-based defence is
    narrower and more restricted than the pre-amendment “artistic merit/educational
    purpose/public good” defences, and therefore less favourable to the respondent
    overall, and he received the benefit of the more favourable latter defences for
    the pre-amendment period.  Moreover, I
    can think of no basis upon which he would be entitled to seek the benefit of
    the pre-amendment defences for the post-amendment period of possession.  He was accordingly subject to the legitimate
    purpose/harm-based provisions of the <i>Code</i> with respect to the child pornography he admittedly possessed during the latter
    period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded, therefore, that the Information as
    charged was defective.  If it were, the
    defect could readily be remedied by an amendment as described above without any
    prejudice to the respondent.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, I would accordingly
    allow the Crown’s appeal, set aside the respondent’s acquittal, and register a
    conviction on the offence charged.  I
    would remit the matter to the trial judge for sentencing.</p>
