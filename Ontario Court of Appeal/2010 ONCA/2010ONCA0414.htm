  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal by the United States of America and the
    United States Federal Trade Commission (the “U.S.” or the “U.S. government”)
    arises from events that began in 2002 and that have resulted in several
    judicial proceedings in Toronto and Chicago.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal raises two central issues: (1) whether an
    Illinois court order granting $19 million in damages and a permanent injunction
    against the defendants<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> should be enforced in Canada; and (2) whether an Ontario court order requiring
    the U.S. to respond to damages undertakings it had made in order to obtain a <i>Mareva</i> injunction and an <i>Anton Piller</i> order should be affirmed.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>     <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    some 20 years, the defendants operated cross-border telemarketing businesses
    selling Canadian and foreign lottery tickets to consumers in the United States.
     Typically, the defendants sold packages
    of tickets costing between $100 and $500, which included a mark-up of between
    five and eight times cost.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the fall of 2002, the U.S. government brought proceedings in Illinois and
    Ontario to prevent the defendants from continuing to operate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In October 2002, District Court Judge Amy St. Eve granted
    an <i>ex parte </i>&quot;Temporary Restraining Order with Asset Freeze and
    Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should not Issue&quot; against
    the defendants, excluding Bungaro<span class=GramE>,  Bunting</span> and several of the corporate
    defendants. Within days, Nordheimer J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
    issued a <i>Mareva </i>injunction and an <i>Anton Piller </i>order against them. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The <i>Mareva </i>and <i>Anton Piller </i>orders were eventually set aside by Gans J., and his order
    was upheld by the Divisional Court. In the meantime, in 2002, the U.S. brought
    a $30 million action in Ontario on behalf of consumers allegedly harmed by the
    defendants.  It also brought proceedings
    against the defendants in Illinois, obtaining a permanent injunction and a $19
    million judgment against them. In 2005, the U.S. amended its Ontario claim,
    adding a claim to enforce the Illinois judgment in Ontario and tracing claims
    against Bungaro, Bunting and Jackpots &amp; Prizes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The decision under appeal arises from three motions
    before Belobaba J. In the first, the defendants asked that the damages
    undertakings, which were given to the Ontario superior court by the U.S. when
    the <i>Mareva </i>and <i>Anton Piller </i>orders were granted, be enforced
    immediately and any damages awarded be paid forthwith. The motion judge granted
    the motion, ordering an immediate damages inquiry and immediate payment of any
    damages awarded. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the second, the U.S. moved for partial summary
    judgment to enforce the 2005 portion of the Ontario claim (effectively
    enforcing the Illinois judgment).  The
    motion judge dismissed this motion on the basis that there was a genuine issue
    as to whether the defendants were denied a &quot;meaningful opportunity to be
    heard&quot; in the context of the U.S. proceedings.  The U.S. brought a motion before the
    Divisional Court for leave to appeal this interlocutory decision.  Molloy J. granted leave, and the appeal was
    transferred to this court: 2010 <span class=SpellE>CanLII</span> 1409 (ON
    S.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>In the third, </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>the defendants moved to stay the Ontario action or,
    in the alternative, to strike the damages portion of the pleadings.  The motion judge allowed the motion in part, staying
    the 2002 portion of the Ontario claim on the basis that it was plain and
    obvious that the U.S. government had no standing to bring an action in Ontario
    seeking to recover damages on behalf of a group of U.S. consumers allegedly
    harmed by the defendants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>The motion judge
    paints a picture of the defendants as upstanding business people who have
    suffered serious harm as a result of the <i>Mareva </i>injunction and <i>Anton
    Piller </i>order granted on bad affidavit evidence.  The harm was compounded, says the motion
    judge, when a parallel, cross-border proceeding was commenced by the U.S.
    government, and the defendants’ efforts to mount a proper defence to the U.S.
    proceedings were impeded by the wrongfully obtained Ontario orders.  In the motion judge’s view, it is time to
    remedy the great injustice done to the defendants.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>In contrast, the
    U.S. paints a very different picture of the defendants as persons who have
    flouted U.S. and Canadian law and unfairly taken advantage of consumers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>There are other
    facts, relating to both the defendants’ lottery ticket sales activities and to
    the various decisions made in the Illinois and Ontario courts, relevant to the
    disposition of the appeal.  However, in
    my view it is preferable to refer to these additional facts in the context of
    the legal issues to which they relate.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Did the motion judge err by ordering an

    the motion judge err by failing to find that there were “special circumstances”
    to refuse a damages inquiry, namely that the only damages the defendants can
    establish result from their inability to carry on an enterprise that is illegal
    in the United States and Canada? </span></p>

    the U.S. brought a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking enforcement of

    Illinois court’s 2004 judgment granting a permanent injunction and U.S. $19
    million in damages, and added tracing claims against <span class=SpellE>Bungaro</span>,
    Bunting and Jackpots &amp; Prizes.</span></p>

    were no genuine issues for trial concerning the defences of jurisdiction,
    natural justice or public policy, as outlined in <i>Beals v. Saldanha</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416 (“<i>Beals</i>”). However, he found that there was a genuine issue for trial
    concerning a fourth “new defence”, namely the denial of a “meaningful
    opportunity to be heard.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before the motion judge, the defendants argued that they
    were denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard in the U.S. context.  They said they could not present a full
    defence in the U.S. because they were invested in setting aside the <i>ex parte </i>orders in Canada.  They also pointed
    to evidence that they lacked access to business documents and computers, making
    finding documents and instructing counsel difficult.  They claimed they were afraid to enter the
    U.S. for fear they would be detained.  They pointed to the fact that within two weeks after having their bank
    accounts frozen, documents seized, and business premises shut down, they were
    expected to mount a defence in the U.S. proceeding. </span></p>

    said that they were forced to agree to the preliminary injunction in November
    2002 because they did not have the financial means and access to documents to
    prepare an oral evidentiary hearing to defend the case on the merits.  In addition, they argued they had no choice

    is indistinguishable from the natural justice defence.  On this point, I agree with what Molloy J.
    said at para. 10 of  her reasons granting
    leave to appeal: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    main difficulty I have with the reasoning of the motions judge is in
    determining how the “new defence” he articulated is different from the natural
    justice defence traditionally available as recognized in <i>Beals</i> and on which he held the defendants had failed to demonstrate
    a genuine issue for trial.  The right to
    be heard is one of the cornerstones of natural justice.  A right to be heard that is not meaningful
    would not comply with the traditional test for natural justice: <i>Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at para. <span class=GramE>30 and 32.</span> Therefore the addition of the word “meaningful” does nothing to change the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The

    St. Eve granted the defendants a requested adjournment to investigate the
    reliability and authenticity of certain documents, which they failed to
    utilize:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Defendants
    attack the reliability and authenticity of the FTC’s evidence contained in the
    declaration of the FTC’s investigator, Alan Krause.  (R. 38-1, Defs.’ <span class=GramE>Mem.</span> <span class=GramE>In Opp.</span> <span class=GramE>To the FTC’s Mot.</span> <span
class=GramE>For Partial Summ.</span> J. (“Defs.’ Opp. Mem.”) <span class=GramE>at</span> 10.) This attack has no merit.  Defendants filed a motion pursuant to <i>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f)</i> for an extension of time to
    allow for needed discovery concerning the quality and authenticity of the FTC’s
    investigation, which was conducted by Mr. Krause. (R. 33-1, Defs.’ <i>Rule 56(f)</i> Mot. <span class=GramE>For
    Extension of Time.)</span> The Court granted the motion and gave Defendants an
    additional three weeks to file their response brief, expressly to allow them to
    depose Mr. Krause.  (<i>See</i> Minute Order, Sept. 17, 2003.) Defendants, however, made no
    attempt to schedule Mr. Krause’s deposition.  (<i>See</i> R. 39-1, FTC’s Reply Mem.
    at 8.) Mr. Krause swore to the truth of his declaration and the authenticity of
    the exhibits attached to his declaration.  Defendants had the opportunity to depose Mr. Krause to support their
    speculation that Mr. Krause’s declaration and exhibits are “incorrect” and “unreliable”,
    but they chose not to do so: at p. 6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judge St. Eve also addressed the defendants’ complaint
    about lack of access to relevant documents:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Defendants complain that the FTC relies on evidence
    that Defendants “cannot review or dispute” and “cannot investigate.” (R. 38-1,
    Defs.’ Opp. Mem. <span class=GramE>at</span> 13.) Defendants refer to specific
    exhibits and tape recordings referenced in Mr. Krause’s declaration.  Defendants, however, have had more than one
    year to request and listen to the tape recordings cited by the FTC as evidence
    of certain material facts.  The FTC made
    more than six boxes of supporting documents available to Defendants when the
    FTC responded to Defendants’ document requests in July 2003. <span class=GramE>(R.
    39-1, FTC’s Reply Mem. at 9.)</span> Defendants cannot now complain that they
    chose not to review those documents: at p. 6. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary on this point, on the basis of the U.S. District
    Court record, including the comprehensive reasons for judgment of Judge St.
    Eve, there is nothing to suggest any unfairness to the defendants in the U.S.
    summary judgment proceeding.  The
    defendants had a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, and particularly crucial in my view, in their
    appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the
    defendants made no natural justice or denial of a meaningful opportunity to be
    heard argument.  The appeal related
    almost entirely to the defendants’ submission that Judge St. Eve erred by
    holding Yemec and Rapp liable for the various corporations’ allegedly deceptive
    practices: (2005), 415 F.3d 758.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I conclude that there is no “new”
    defence relating to “a meaningful opportunity to be heard”.  Such a defence is extremely circumscribed by
    a fair reading of <span class=SpellE><i>Beals</i></span><i> </i>and <i>King
    v. Drabinsky</i>. In any event, even if there were such a defence, the
    defendants have not established it in this case.  The U.S. court proceedings, trial and appeal,
    were fair throughout.  The defendants
    received, and exercised, a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to a different argument relating to the
    enforcement of the U.S. judgment.  On
    this appeal, the defendants challenge, for the first time, whether the Ontario
    courts should enforce the injunctive relief component of the U.S. court order,
    which includes the following ban on telemarketing as well as other injunctive
    relief: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>IT IS
    THEREFORE ORDERED THAT</b> Defendants George Yemec, Anita Rapp, and the
    Canadian Corporate Defendants, are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined
    from engaging in, participating in, or assisting in the Telemarketing, in any
    manner, of any product or service to any person in the U.S.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of this submission, the defendants rely on <i>Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc.</i>, [2006]
    2. S.C.R. 612, at para. 14, where <span class=SpellE>Deschamps</span> J. stated
    that “[t]he recognition and enforcement of equitable orders will require a
    balanced measure of restraint and involvement by the domestic court that is
    otherwise unnecessary when the court merely agrees to use its enforcement
    mechanisms to collect a debt.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept the defendants’ submission.  Not only was this issue not raised before the
    motion judge but the scope of the injunction was not challenged before the
    United States Court of Appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I see no basis on the merits for refusing
    to enforce the injunctive relief component of the U.S. court order.  In <i>Pro
    Swing</i>, <span class=SpellE>Deschamps</span> J. enumerated some of the
    factors to consider in determining whether a foreign equitable order should be
    enforced in Canada, at para. 30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Relevant considerations may thus include the
    criteria that guide Canadian courts in crafting domestic orders, such as: Are
    the terms of the order clear and specific enough to ensure that the defendant
    will know what is expected from him or her?  Is the order limited in its scope and did the originating court retain
    the power to issue further orders?  Is
    the enforcement the least burdensome remedy for the Canadian justice
    system?  Is the Canadian litigant exposed
    to unforeseen obligations?  Are any third
    parties affected by the order?  Will the
    use of judicial resources be consistent with what would be allowed for domestic
    litigants?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these factors line up almost entirely in
    favour of enforcement of the United States court order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The terms of the injunction are simple, clear and
    specific; it would be obvious to the defendants what they cannot do in the
    United States.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order could have been narrower, restraining only
    telemarketing activities relating to the sale of foreign lottery tickets.  However, given Judge St. Eve’s ultimate
    conclusion that the defendants’ activities constituted deceptive practices in
    violation of the <i>Federal Trade Commission
    Act, </i>15 U.S.C. §45(a) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 310,
    I cannot say that a complete prohibition of telemarketing aimed at people in the
    United States is unfair or unreasonable.  Moreover, Judge St. Eve’s order specifically directed that the District
    Court would retain jurisdiction to enable any party to seek modifications to
    the order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enforcement of the U.S. court order does not place an
    undue burden on the Canadian justice system.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can see no unforeseen obligations to which the
    defendants will be exposed. Compliance with U.S. law is not, of course, an
    unforeseen obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The U.S. court order does affect some third parties (it
    requires the defendants to provide information about their customers).  However, this information is needed in light
    of the $19 million damages award; it is unlikely that consumers will object on
    privacy grounds to the release of contact information that might assist the
    U.S. government to distribute that amount. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, enforcement of the U.S. court order is
    consistent with the types of orders that would be allowed for domestic
    litigants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I reject the defendants’ submission
    that the Ontario courts should not enforce the injunctive relief component of
    the U.S. court order.</p>

    October 3, 2002, the U.S. bought an <i>ex
    parte</i> motion before Nordheimer J. for a <i>Mareva </i>injunction and an <i>Anton Piller</i> order. The U.S. claimed that the defendants enticed senior citizens in the
    United States to purchase packages of tickets in foreign lotteries, and that
    the customers were subsequently told they had won prizes but must pay
    significant amounts of money in advance to claim them on the pretext that it
    was necessary to pay government duties or taxes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on the material before him, which included allegations of such “up-front fee
    fraud”, Nordheimer J. was satisfied that the U.S. had made out a “strong <i>prima</i> <i>facie </i>case of fraud” and granted a <i>Mareva</i> injunction. He was also satisfied that the test for granting
    an <i>Anton Piller</i> order had been
    met.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a
    condition of obtaining the orders, the U.S. government gave two undertakings to

    may make if it ultimately appears that the granting of the Order has caused

    computers and more than 250 boxes of documents, and froze their bank accounts.
    The effect was to shut-down the defendants’ business virtually overnight. </p>

    conduct was fraudulent, and had failed to show that there was a risk of

    up-front fees came from other telemarketers in other companies located in British
    Columbia and Quebec. Alan Krause, the FTC investigator who swore the affidavit
    that was submitted before Nordheimer J. and Gans J., had referred to statements
    contained in several victim declarations that were appended as exhibits but they
    did not implicate the Yemec defendants. At most, there was a triable issue with
    respect to the up-front fee issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants’ motion seeking enforcement of the
    damages undertakings came before the motion judge in April 2009. The U.S.
    vigorously resisted the motion, arguing that the undertakings should not be
    enforced or, in the alternative, that they should not be enforced immediately
    The government’s key submission was that there were “special circumstances” for
    the court not to order a damages inquiry: the defendants’ lottery-ticket
    telemarketing business was illegal in Canada and the United States, and the
    defendants could claim no damages arising from the termination of an illegal
    business. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the considerable evidence put forward
    by the U.S. concerning the legality of the defendants’ telemarketing business,
    the motion judge concluded that this was not an appropriate case to depart from
    the general presumption that damages undertakings are to be enforced. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With regard to the legality of the defendants’ business
    in Canada, he “could not find on the evidence before [him] that the Yemec
    organization over its twenty years of successful operations was engaging in
    conduct that was clearly in breach of Canadian criminal law.” That said, he
    found that the resale of Canadian lottery tickets to Americans would probably
    contravene s. 206 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>following
    this court’s decision in <i>R</i>. <i>v.</i> <i>World
    Media Brokers Inc.</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 385. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the legality of the defendants’ business in the
    United States, he was not persuaded that “the nature of the illegality that
    [had] been established under U.S. law [was] sufficient to relieve the
    plaintiffs of their obligations on their undertaking[s].” He noted that the
    defendants were not charged with violating the criminal lottery-mailing
    provisions under 18 U.S.C. §1301 and §1302. In his view, “[t]he ultimate
    disposition in the U.S. proceeding turned on a real but relatively esoteric
    breach of an FTC telemarketing sales rule”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge weighed the U.S.’s conduct with the
    defendants’ conduct, concluding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court is obliged to compare and balance the
    conduct of both sides. Here, one side wrongfully obtained extraordinarily
    intrusive <i>ex parte</i> remedies on bad
    affidavit evidence that ended up destroying the businesses and lives of the
    individual defendants. The other side used a telemarketing script (which Mr.
    Yemec insists was actually revised in 1990) that breached an FTC sales rule, a
    breach that caused little if any damages to anyone. There is no comparison. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also rejected the submission that the
    defendants’ damages claim was “plainly unsustainable”. In his view, the
    defendants had adduced “some credible evidence” that they had suffered loss as
    a result of the <i>ex parte</i> orders and
    they deserved their day in court to present evidence and make argument. </p>

lang=EN-US>      <u>Legal Analysis</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the motion judge that this is not an
    appropriate case to depart from the strong presumption that a party who gives
    an undertaking to obtain an interlocutory injunction should be held to the
    undertaking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed in <i>Vieweger Construction Co. Ltd. v. Rush &amp;
    Tompkins Construction Ltd.</i>, [1965] S.C.R. 195, at p. 207, “the rule is,
    that whenever the undertaking is given, and the plaintiff ultimately fails on
    the merits, an inquiry as to damages will be granted unless there are special
    circumstances to the contrary.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has since elaborated <span style='color:
#010101'>on</span> the special circumstances test in <span class=GramE><i>Gu</i></span><i> v. Tai Foong International Ltd.</i> (2003), 168 O.A.C. 47, at para.
    58, where it affirmed the following passage from <i>Nelson Burns &amp; Co. v. Gratham Industries Ltd. </i>(1987), 25 O.A.C.
    89 (C.A.), at paras. 10-11:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Since the
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Vieweger </i>an important change has taken place in the law with respect to
    interlocutory injunctions. As a result of a decision of the House of Lords in <i>American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd.</i>,
    [1975] A.C. 396, the balance of convenience test has largely displaced an
    earlier view that an applicant could obtain an interlocutory injunction only if
    he could show a strong <i>prima facie</i> case. Whatever the differences may be between the two standards it is now plain
    that in Ontario interlocutory injunctions are now easier to obtain than was the
    case prior to the <i>American Cyanamid</i> case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Because of this change and because of the
    number of such injunctions that are sought it is appropriate to emphasize the
    serious nature of the undertaking to pay damages which is a condition of the
    issuance of the interlocutory injunction. In the ordinary course the
    unsuccessful plaintiff must understand that he is obliged to pay damages in
    accordance with his undertaking without quibble, and courts generally will be
    unsympathetic towards those who seek to resile from such an obligation.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there are three main reasons the U.S.
    should not be permitted to <span class=SpellE>resile</span> from its
    undertaking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the orders were dissolved as a result of the
    U.S. government’s wrongful conduct in obtaining the <i>ex parte</i> orders, including leading Nordheimer J.  <span class=GramE>to</span> believe that the
    defendants were involved in up-front fee fraud even though the consumer
    complaints did not relate to the defendants. I observe that the U.S. has since
    abandoned its allegations based on such evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained by A.A.S. Zuckerman in his article “The
    Undertaking in Damages – Substantive and Procedural Dimensions” (1994) 53(3)
    Cambridge L.J. 546, at p. 557, “a plaintiff who suppresses facts that would
    count against his application strips the defendant of his procedural protection
    [notice and the opportunity to be heard] and causes an <i>ex parte</i> order to be made when it might otherwise have been
    denied.”  To prevent such abuse, notes
    the author, it is an important to have effective and robust sanctions. “Without
    an adequate sanction of damages, and absent contempt or abuse of process, the
    worst that a plaintiff who fails to disclose the full facts has to fear is a
    discharge of the <i>ex parte</i> injunction
    with costs”: p. 559. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the U.S. submits that there should be no
    damages inquiry because the defendants operated illegally in Canada and the
    United States, and it is contrary to public policy to recover damages arising
    from the termination of an illegal business. However, the government was aware
    of the general nature of the defendants’ business at the time it sought the <i>ex parte</i> orders. The FTC had been
    investigating the defendants’ business since 1999. It is evident that the
    reason the government brought proceedings against the defendants in both Canada
    and the United States was the belief that the defendants were operating in
    contravention of Canadian and U.S. law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Effectively, after wrongly obtaining the <i>ex parte</i> orders, the U.S. now seeks to
    avoid an inquiry into damages on the basis that the undertakings were worthless
    from the outset since there can be no damages flowing from the termination of
    an illegal operation. In my view, to give effect to such an argument in these
    circumstances would be to undermine the serious nature of a damages
    undertaking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, while the quantum of any damages is an open
    question, I am not persuaded that the defendants’ damages claim is “plainly unsustainable”,
    to borrow from the language of <i>Yukong
    Line Ltd. v. Rendsburg Investments Corporation</i>, [2000] EWCA Civ. 358 (C.A.),
    at para. 35. I say this notwithstanding ample evidence that the defendants
    contravened Canadian and U.S. law in operating their lottery-ticket
    telemarketing business.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that
    the defendants’ conduct should not absolve the U.S. from undergoing a damages
    assessment, I do not agree entirely with his assessment of the illegality of
    the defendants’ business. In my view, he erred in concluding that there was no
    evidence that, over its twenty years of operations, the Yemec organization had not
    engaged in conduct “that was clearly in breach of Canadian criminal law”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, Fairgrieve J. found World Media Brokers Inc.
    and Grand Print Inc. – two  of the
    defendants in this case – guilty under s. 206 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for having “offer[ed] for sale … shares of tickets
    in” a Spanish lottery: (1998), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 180 (O.C.J.). His decision was
    upheld by this court on appeal: (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 385. This conviction is
    clear evidence of illegality. As Arbour J.A. stated in <i>R. v. Farinacci </i>(1993), [1994] 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at p. 37, “[a]
    conviction … constitutes a legal, conclusive finding of guilt. … [I]t is
    enforceable unless and until reversed.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While <i>World
    Brokers</i> only dealt with the resale of Spanish lottery tickets, I agree with
    the motion judge’s view that the case signals that the resale of Canadian
    lottery tickets would also contravene s. 206 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, there is strong evidence that the
    defendants’ lottery ticket telemarketing business contravened U.S. law. Judge
    St. Eve’s <span class=GramE>judgment, together with the Court of Appeals’ decision,
    are</span> conclusive proof that Yemec, Rapp and the named corporate defendants
    contravened the <i>FTC Act</i> and the FTC’s
    Telemarketing Sales Rule. They were found liable based on the undisputed facts
    that they sold foreign lottery tickets to U.S. consumers, mailed foreign
    lottery materials to U.S. consumers, and misrepresented to those consumers that
    their activities were legal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While they were not charged and convicted criminally
    under 18 U.S.C. §1301 or §1302 (the lottery mailing provisions), Judge St. Eve
    expressly found that “the Corporate Defendants’ representations were deceptive
    with respect to 18 U.S.C. §1301.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Seventh
    Circuit, Yemec and Anita Rapp argued that Judge St. Eve had erred in holding
    them jointly and severally liable for the $19 million in consumer redress.  Circuit Judge <span class=SpellE>Rovner</span> rejected this submission, concluding that there was ample evidence that they
    knew that selling Canadian lottery tickets to U.S. consumers was illegal. That
    evidence included the United States Postal Service’s 1991 order requiring <span
class=SpellE>Yemec</span> and Rapp to “cease and desist from engaging in the
    conduct of any lottery scheme for the distribution of money by lottery, chance
    or drawing of any kind in which any use of the United States mail is
    involved”.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be up to the damages inquiry judge to
    determine, considering this and other evidence of illegality, whether the
    defendants have sustained any compensable damages, taking into account the principles
    of causation, remoteness, foreseeability and mitigation, and the general rule
    of public policy that precludes a person from benefitting from his or her own crime:<i> Nordstrom v. Baumann</i>, [1962] S.C.R.
    147, at p. 156. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking into account those principles, it may be
    difficult for the defendants to prove that they have suffered compensable
    damages. Nonetheless, I am not satisfied that their entire damages claim is
    plainly unsustainable such that they should be denied the opportunity to
    present their evidence and make full argument.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note, for instance, the decision in <i>Columbia Picture Industries Inc. v. Robinson</i>,
    [1987] 1 Ch. 38 (Q.B.). An issue in <i>Columbia
    Picture</i> was what, if any, damages the defendants could recover on a damages
    undertaking. Scott J. concluded that the defendants “[could not] expect to be
    compensated for damages to the illicit part of the businesses”, which involved
    selling pirated videotapes: p. 87. However, he awarded damages in the amount of
    £10,000, recognizing that the combination of the<i> Anton Piller</i> order and<i> Mareva</i> injunction made it impossible for the defendants to obtain credit,
    that the retention of business documents made any continuity of business very
    difficult, and that there was a legitimate part to the defendants’ business,
    albeit a small part. In his view, “[t]he defendants’ chance to continue on a
    small scale a legitimate business was impaired by the <i>ex parte</i> order being obtained and executed”: p. 88. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, while evidence of illegality is an
    important consideration in determining whether to order a damages inquiry, I
    agree with the motion judge that, taking into account the circumstances of this
    case, there should be an assessment of damages to determine what, if any,
    compensable damages the defendants have sustained as a result of the wrongfully
    obtained orders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    raised on the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3)       <u>Standing</u></span></h4>

    motion judge concluded that it was plain and obvious that the U.S. government
    did not have standing to sue in Canada on behalf of a group of unnamed American
    consumers for damages allegedly caused by the defendants.  This conclusion related to the 2002 Ontario claim <span class=GramE>by  the</span> U.S. for
    $30 million in damages and injunctive relief.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the oral hearing of this appeal, counsel for the U.S. government indicated that
    if this court allowed the appeal with respect to the enforcement of the U.S.

    of the claims in the 2002 statement of claim.</span></p>

    Canada on behalf of a group of American consumers for damages allegedly
    sustained by individuals in this group.  In these circumstances, I would decline to address this issue.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)       <u>The cross-appeal: abuse of process</u></span></h4>

    government’s conduct in the U.S. court proceedings was an abuse of process such
    that the 2005 Ontario action should be stayed. I disagree.  In brief compass (four paragraphs), the
    motion judge dismissed this claim.  He
    said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    defendants’ submissions alleging abuse of process are essentially the same as
    those that were advanced in the second motion alleging denial of natural justice
    and violation of public policy…. One could further conclude, <i>a fortiori</i>, that there can be no basis
    for finding an abuse of process.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    agree with this reasoning and conclusion.  However, I make this observation.  The linkage and overlap the motion judge correctly sees between natural
    justice and abuse of process are precisely the same linkage and overlap that
    exist between natural justice and the proposed “new” defence of a meaningful
    opportunity to be heard.</span></p>
