  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 2, 2004, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Bonita
    Maher and her son were grocery shopping at their local A&amp;P grocery store in
    Thunder Bay, Ontario (the “store” or the “Thunder Bay store”).  An individual pushing a floor cleaning
    machine came directly toward them without slowing down or appearing likely to
    stop.  Ms. Maher moved out of the way and
    then she and her son moved to the area that the cleaning machine had passed
    over.  Virtually immediately, they both
    slipped and Ms. Maher fell to the floor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Maher sued the store owner, The Great Atlantic &amp;
    Pacific Company of Canada, Limited (“A&amp;P”), for damages for the injuries
    she suffered as a result of the fall.  She also sued Central Building Services Group Ltd. (“CBSG”), the company
    that A&amp;P had hired to provide floor cleaning services for a number of its stores
    in Ontario, including the one in question.  CBSG had subcontracted its responsibilities for cleaning the floors of the
    Thunder Bay store to <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> Cleaning Services Ltd. (“<span
class=SpellE>Adis</span>”).  <span
class=SpellE>Adis</span> was also named as a defendant in Ms. Maher’s
    lawsuit.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Maher’s case rested primarily on the “slip and
    fall” allegation.  However, the claim
    also contained independent allegations of negligence and/or breaches of the <i>Occupier’s Liability Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. O.2, on the part of each of the three defendants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A&amp;P <span class=SpellE>crossclaimed</span> against
    CBSG and <span class=SpellE>Adis</span>.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial of the main action was conducted with a
    jury.  The jury found that A&amp;P, CBSG
    and <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> met their obligations to Ms. Maher and the
    action was dismissed.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then heard evidence on A&amp;P’s <span
class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> against CBSG.  By judgment dated January 12, 2009 (the “Judgment”), the <span
class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A&amp;P appeals from the dismissal of its <span
class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> against CBSG.  It contends that certain indemnification provisions in the agreements
    between it and CBSG render CBSG responsible for all the costs that it incurred
    in defending the lawsuit, irrespective of liability on the part of CBSG.  It says that the trial judge erred in
    interpreting the indemnity provisions otherwise.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A&amp;P AND CBSG</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CBSG agreed to provide floor cleaning services for a
    number of A&amp;P stores in Ontario, including the Thunder Bay store.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with its usual practice, A&amp;P then
    sent to CBSG, for signature, a cover letter and three standard form documents,
    Forms “A”, “B” and “C”.  Only Forms “A”
    and “B” are relevant to the present action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 17, 2003, CBSG signed and returned the cover
    letter and standard form documents.  It
    understood that signing the documents was a requirement of doing business with
    A&amp;P.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, in addition to Form “A” and Form “B”, A&amp;P
    relied on the Floor Contractor Protocol (the “Protocol”), which had been
    prepared by its health and safety department.  CBSG acknowledged that the Protocol was the subject of an oral agreement
    between it and A&amp;P.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>Paragraph 10 is the relevant part
    of the Protocol.  It is contained in the
    part of the Protocol that is entitled “Insurance and Claims Management
    Requirements”.  It reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10.  The
    Contractor will accept full responsibility for, indemnify, hold harmless and
    reimburse [A&amp;P] forthwith for any and all damages, interest and/or costs
    incurred by [A&amp;P] associated with the handling of any customer or employee
    accident claim which was caused or contributed to by the contractor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>“Contractor” is defined in the Protocol to include any
    subcontractors retained to perform floor maintenance.  Thus, when the word “contractor” is used below,
    it refers to both CBSG and <span class=SpellE>Adis</span>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span

    “Continuing Indemnity”.  The relevant portion
    of Form “A” reads as follows:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In respect of each product … or … service …
    delivered on the order of [A&amp;P], [CBSG] does hereby agree to indemnify and
    hold harmless A&amp;P ... in connection with ... any and all actions, … demands
    or any other types of claims alleging liability for purported personal injury
    ... (including, but not limited to, lost wages, direct and consequential
    damages, medical expenses, insurance expenses, any other types of fees, costs,
    expenses and any other types of out-of-pocket expenditures), and any other
    liabilities of any kind whatsoever (collectively, the “Claims”), arising out of
    or relating or referring in any way to ... the provision of such services … (the
    “Claims Indemnification Obligation”) ... [CBSG] understands and expressly
    agrees that it shall be required to fully satisfy the Claims Indemnification
    Obligation whether or not any of the Claims result, in whole or in part, from
    the negligence of A&amp;P …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> … [I]n
    addition to satisfying the Claims Indemnification Obligation defined above,
    [CBSG] shall indemnify and hold harmless A&amp;P ... in connection with all
    attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by A&amp;P in attempting to protect or enforce
    its rights under this Indemnity (the “Attorneys’ Fees Indemnification
    Obligation”).  [CBSG] shall immediately
    assume the obligation of investigating and/or defending, at its sole expense
    and in a timely manner, each one of the Claims. A&amp;P expressly reserves the
    right to retain counsel of its choice to represent it in connection with [such
    claims.]  A&amp;P's retention of such
    counsel shall be paid by [CBSG] to A&amp;P in accordance with [CBSG]'s
    Attorneys’ Fees Indemnification Obligation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    of such premises.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[CBSG] further agree[s] that [it] will undertake at
    its sole cost and expense, the <span class=SpellE>defense</span> of any such
    claim ... regardless of by whom or against whom it is made, provided prompt
    notice is given by A&amp;P ... .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For ease of reference, I will refer to the provisions
    in para. 10 of the Protocol, Form “A” and Form “B” as the “indemnification provisions”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with its understanding of its contractual
    obligations to A&amp;P, CBSG provided A&amp;P with a certificate of insurance
    each year.  The certificates of insurance
    named A&amp;P as an additional insured but only insofar as A&amp;P’s liability
    arose “vicariously out of the negligent operation of [CBSG]”.  A&amp;P never rejected the certificates or suggested
    that the insurance that CBSG had obtained was inadequate.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT AT TRIAL  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the parties took the following
    positions.  A&amp;P argued that through
    the indemnification provisions, CBSG assumed all responsibility for claims
    arising from cleaning operations and, therefore, A&amp;P was to be indemnified
    for its costs of defending the action, regardless of liability.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CBSG made two different submissions in support of its
    contention that each party should bear its own costs.  First, CBSG argued that because allocation of
    litigation expenses is a matter for the court’s discretion, the court had the
    discretion to decline to enforce the indemnification provisions.  Second, it submitted that the intent of the
    indemnification provisions was that CBSG was to reimburse A&amp;P for expenses
    incurred as a result of the negligence of CBSG or those for whom it was
    responsible.  As the jury found that neither
    CBSG nor <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> had been negligent, CBSG was not
    responsible for A&amp;P’s costs of defending the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected CBSG’s first submission,
    noting that the indemnification provisions were not limited to an agreement
    about costs between the parties.  He then
    turned to a consideration of those provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge described Form “A” as “far-reaching”
    and “onerous”.  He interpreted it as
    requiring CBSG to indemnify A&amp;P for any expenses it incurred in defending
    an action, even if the action was based on A&amp;P’s negligence.  In his view<span class=GramE>,  Form</span> “A” made CBSG “become A&amp;P’s
    insurer with respect to claims arising out of the provision of cleaning
    services.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He viewed paragraph 10 of the Protocol quite
    differently.  He described it as “the
    more common provision” in which CBSG’s obligation to reimburse A&amp;P was
    limited to “expenses associated with the handling of any customer or employee
    accident claim which was caused or contributed to by the contractor”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge said that “[b]<span class=SpellE>oth</span> provisions are contained in the same document”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the intention of the parties was
    that expressed in para. 10 of the Protocol.  He noted that this was sensible given that the interpretation argued for
    by A&amp;P made CBSG liable for all costs of an action even where A&amp;P was
    sued for its own negligence and no allegations of negligence were made against
    CBSG or its subcontractor.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the trial judge held that the broad
    wording of Forms “A” and “B” was limited by para. 10 of the Protocol.   He noted that para. 10 provides that CBSG
    would accept full responsibility for “damages, interest and/or costs” incurred
    by A&amp;P for claims that were caused or contributed to by CBSG as the
    contractor and <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> as the subcontractor.  He observed that para. 10 did not say that
    CBSG would accept full responsibility for “any and all claims for” damages,
    interest and/or costs incurred by A&amp;P for claims “which it is alleged” were
    caused or contributed to by the contractor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that, as the jury found that
    neither CBSG nor <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> had failed to take such care as
    was reasonable in the circumstances, the claims were not for damages that had
    been caused or contributed to by CBSG or <span class=SpellE>Adis</span>.  Accordingly, he dismissed A&amp;P’s <span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties take essentially the same positions on
    appeal as they did below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A&amp;P says that when the indemnification provisions are
    considered as a whole, they show that the parties’ real intention was that CSBG
    would indemnify A&amp;P in respect of claims made against A&amp;P arising from
    allegations relating to CBSG’s provision of cleaning services, regardless of
    whether the allegations were also advanced independently against A&amp;P and
    regardless of the outcome of any such claim.  This interpretation, A&amp;P submits, treats para. 10 of the Protocol as
    reflecting general concepts that yield to the more particular and detailed Form
    “A”, thus giving effect to the entire document.  Further, the proposed interpretation takes into account A&amp;P’s aim in
    advancing the specific language in Form “A”, which had to be acknowledged by
    signature on the part of CBSG, whereas para. 10 was merely part of the more
    general document relating to the duties of CBSG.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CBSG says that although this matter is framed as one of
    contractual interpretation, in reality it is an appeal of a costs award.  It submits that the courts have the
    discretion to make a costs order irrespective of any “hold harmless” or
    indemnification provisions.  On this
    submission, CBSG asks this court to treat the order under appeal as an exercise
    of the court’s discretion in respect of costs and to refuse to give leave to
    appeal the order or, alternatively, to dismiss it on the basis that the result
    constitutes a proper exercise of the trial judge’s discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, if the order is based on the
    indemnification provisions, CBSG asks the court to dismiss the appeal on the
    basis that the trial judge read the contractual documents as a whole and his
    interpretation reflects the parties’ intentions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue to be decided on this appeal is whether the
    trial judge erred in his interpretation of the indemnification provisions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to this question, however, I will
    briefly address CBSG’s submission that the order below is a costs award and
    should be treated as such.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IS THE ORDER UNDER APPEAL SIMPLY A COSTS AWARD? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The short answer to this question is “no”.  The trial judge disposed of A&amp;P’s <span
class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> based on his interpretation of the
    indemnification provisions.  He did not
    simply make a costs order in respect of the trial of the main action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, in my view, the trial judge was correct
    when he rejected CBSG’s submission that A&amp;P’s <span class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> could be disposed of by treating it as a matter of costs.  A&amp;P’s <span class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> sought recovery based on the indemnification provisions.  The trial judge was obliged to decide the
    case he had before him, namely, whether A&amp;P was entitled to recover based
    on those provisions.  Moreover, the trial
    judge could not have decided the <span class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> based on
    the usual rules that govern costs because the indemnification provisions
    demonstrated that the parties had agreed, in advance of the litigation, how the
    monetary aspects of a claim for personal injury (including costs) were to be
    resolved.  Accordingly, the <span
class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> fell to be decided based on the contractual
    provisions between the parties.  In the
    circumstances, the trial judge could not have ignored the indemnification
    provisions and decided the <span class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> as if he were
    making a costs order in respect of the main action.    </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DID THE TRIAL JUDGE ERR IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE
    INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on his interpretation of the indemnification
    provisions, the trial judge dismissed A&amp;P’s <span class=SpellE>crossclaim</span>.  I agree with the result but for different
    reasons than those given by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in the circumstances of this case, it is
    unnecessary to decide how para. 10 of the Protocol should be interpreted in
    relation to Form “A”.  As I will explain,
    neither provision leads to the conclusion that CBSG must reimburse A&amp;P for
    the costs incurred in defending the present action.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If para. 10 of the Protocol <span class=GramE>applies</span>,
    CBSG is liable to reimburse A&amp;P only if the contractor caused or
    contributed to the accident claim.  On
    the findings of the jury, neither CBSG nor <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> caused or contributed to the claim with the result that CBSG is not liable to
    indemnify A&amp;P.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Form “A”, CBSG must indemnify A&amp;P for claims
    arising out of CBSG’s provision of cleaning services.  In the present action, there were claims against
    A&amp;P separate and apart from those related to CBSG’s provision of cleaning
    services, based on occupier’s liability and independent claims of
    negligence.  An example of a claim made
    against A&amp;P based on occupier’s liability can be found in para. 4 (e) of
    the Statement of Claim in which it is alleged that A&amp;P failed “to inspect
    the premises to ensure that they were safe for use and free from hazards”.  An example of a claim in negligence against
    A&amp;P that is independent of CBSG’s provision of cleaning services can be
    found in para. 4(c) of the Statement of Claim in which it is alleged that
    A&amp;P failed to “exercise reasonable care and attention for persons lawfully
    on the premises”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even on the interpretation of Form “A” advocated for by
    A&amp;P, these claims are not within its scope because they arise independently
    of the provision of cleaning services by CBSG.  While it may be that an argument could be made that Form “A” required CBSG
    to bear responsibility for some part of the costs of A&amp;P’s defence, that
    argument was not made in this court or below. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add two further reasons as to why A&amp;P’s <span
class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> should be dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appears to have viewed the
    indemnification provision in Form “A” to be in conflict with para. 10 of the
    Protocol.  He then appears to have preferred
    the language in para. 10 of the Protocol over that of Form “A”, in part because
    he viewed it as promoting a commercially reasonable result.  To the extent that the trial judge followed an
    approach based on choosing between two apparently conflicting provisions, in my
    view, he fell into error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence makes it clear that where there are
    apparent inconsistencies in contractual provisions, the court should attempt to
    find an interpretation which can reasonably give meaning to each provision.  In <i>BG <span
class=SpellE>Checo</span> International Ltd</i>. v. <i>British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12 at p.
    24, La Forest and <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> JJ., writing for the
    majority, stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where there are apparent inconsistencies between
    different terms of a contract, the court should attempt to find an
    interpretation which can reasonably give meaning to each of the terms in
    question.  Only if an interpretation
    giving reasonable consistency to the terms in question cannot be found will the
    court rule one clause or the other ineffective.  In this process, the terms will, if reasonably possible, be reconciled
    by construing one term as a qualification of the other term.  A frequent result of this kind of analysis
    will be that general terms of a contract will be seen to be qualified by
    specific terms - or, to put it another way, where there is apparent conflict
    between a general term and a specific term, the terms may be reconciled by
    taking the parties to have intended the scope of the general term to not extend
    to the subject-matter of the specific term. [<span class=GramE>citations</span> omitted]   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this approach, while at first blush the
    indemnification provisions appear to be in conflict, in my view, they can be
    interpreted as a whole rather than choosing between the two.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin by considering the indemnification provisions
    in context.  They exist as part of the agreement
    between A&amp;P and CBSG under the terms of which CBSG agreed to provide floor
    cleaning services for A&amp;P stores.  Form “A” sets out, in general terms, CBSG’s obligation to indemnify
    A&amp;P in respect of any claim that is <span class=SpellE>referable</span> to
    the cleaning services that CBSG (or <span class=SpellE>Adis</span>, as
    subcontractor) provides.  The wording of
    para. 10 of the Protocol <span class=GramE>is</span> more specific than that in
    Form “A”.  Significantly, para. 10 limits
    CBSG’s indemnity obligation to claims that are “caused or contributed to” by
    the contractor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two provisions can be read as being in
    conflict.  However, following the
    approach mandated by <i>BC <span
class=SpellE>Checo</span></i>, they can be read together if the specific terms
    of para. 10 are seen as qualifying the general obligation that CBSG undertook
    by agreeing to Form “A”.  Put another
    way, the two provisions can be reconciled by taking the parties to have
    intended that the scope of the general term in Form “A” is limited by the
    specific term in para. 10 of the Protocol.  Thus, CBSG’s obligation to indemnify A&amp;P for claims relating to the
    provision of floor cleaning services is limited to claims that were caused or
    contributed to by the contractor.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Like the trial
    judge, I am of the view that this interpretation also best accords with commercial
    reality and <span class=GramE>provides</span> a fair result because it leads to
    the conclusion that CBSG was liable only for its negligence and the negligence
    of those for whom it was legally responsible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, even if the indemnification provisions are
    found to conflict, A&amp;P’s <span class=SpellE>crossclaim</span> should be
    dismissed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the indemnification provisions are in conflict, they
    create an ambiguity in that they lead to two possible reasonable interpretations.  Those two interpretations are the ones offered
    by the parties.  On the one hand, A&amp;P
    urges an interpretation that is largely based on Form “A”.  That interpretation would lead to CBSG being responsible
    for all the costs and expenses incurred in defending the lawsuit, irrespective
    of liability.  On the other hand, CBSG
    urges an interpretation that rests largely on para. 10 of the Protocol.  On this interpretation, CBSG is liable to reimburse
    A&amp;P for costs and expenses that A&amp;P incurred in defending the action
    only if CBSG (or those for whom it was legally responsible) caused or
    contributed to the accident.  As I have
    explained, I do not read the indemnification provisions to be in conflict but
    if they could not be read together, it seems to me that both of these
    interpretations are reasonably possible, thus creating an ambiguity.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where contractual provisions are found to be ambiguous,
    the court is entitled to consider extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity:
    see <i>Arthur Andersen Inc. v.
    Toronto-Dominion Bank </i>(1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 363 (C.A.), at p. 372, leave to
    appeal to S.C.C. refused (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) xvi.  In my view, the extrinsic evidence of the certificates
    of insurance provided by CBSG to A&amp;P resolves the ambiguity in favour of
    the interpretation urged by CBSG.  That
    evidence, it will be recalled, is that each year, CBSG gave A&amp;P a
    certificate of insurance that named A&amp;P as an additional insured but only
    insofar as A&amp;P’s liability arose from CBSG’s negligence.  The evidence further showed that A&amp;P
    never rejected the certificates or suggested that the insurance was inadequate.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the indemnification provisions were standard
    forms that had been drafted by A&amp;P.  It will be recalled that Forms “A” and “B” were presented to CBSG for
    signature, as a condition of doing business.  On the record, there was no opportunity for CBSG to modify the wording
    of those documents or the Protocol.  Although
    the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem </i>is
    a doctrine of last resort,<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> it <span class=GramE>is  doctrine</span> of general application that can apply to contracts authored by one party and
    which permitted the other party no opportunity to modify its wording.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  As A&amp;P was the author of the documents in
    question, the doctrine of <i>contra
    proferentem </i>leads to the conclusion that the ambiguity created by the
    conflicting provisions is to be construed against A&amp;P.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a final note, I see no significance in the fact that
    the trial judge described para. 10 of the Protocol as being in the “same
    document” as Form “A”.  On a full reading
    of the reasons, it appears to me that the trial judge simply meant that both
    formed part of the agreement between CBSG and A&amp;P.  Understood in that way, the trial judge made
    no error.       </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to
    the respondent, CBSG, fixed at $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
