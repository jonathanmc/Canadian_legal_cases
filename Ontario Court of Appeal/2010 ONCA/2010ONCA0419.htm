  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 3, 1983, the plaintiff, Chantal <span
class=SpellE>Hampel</span>, was struck by a vehicle as she crossed Chippewa
    Street in North Bay on foot.  She did not
    cross at a cross-walk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was nine years old at the time and under four
    feet tall.  She and her older brother,
    Marc <span class=SpellE>Hampel</span>, had been at Memorial Gardens and were
    walking back to their grandmother’s home, going westbound on the north side of
    Chippewa Street.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Carmen Giroux, was the driver of the
    vehicle.  Her children had also been at
    the Gardens that day, and so she was travelling eastbound on Chippewa Street to
    pick them up.  At the time of the
    accident, the respondent was employed as a school bus driver.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, her brother crossed the
    street first.  Before she followed, she
    saw a line-up of cars that had stopped and when the driver of the first car
    waved to her to pass, she crossed, “walking briskly”.  She recalled there being parked cars on
    either side of the road.  She admitted
    that she did not stop once she had begun to traverse the street and also acknowledged
    that she did <u>not</u> “look left and right” before crossing past the car that
    waved her along.  The next thing she
    remembers is lying on a front lawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial by judge and jury the appellant’s
    action was dismissed.  In essence, the
    jury found the respondent had discharged the reverse onus on her of proving
    that she was not negligent.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of the several grounds of appeal raised in the appellant’s
    factum, we need address only the three discussed below.      </p>
  <h3><span class=GramE>Issue 1.</span>          Did the trial judge’s correcting
    instruction cure the respondent’s alleged improper cross-examination on the
    hospital record?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, defence counsel used a hospital note in order
    to cross-examine the appellant on her claim that she was “walking briskly” but
    was neither “rushing” nor “running” at the time of the accident.  It stated, in part: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This nine year old girl ran out between some parked
    cars and was struck by an oncoming vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to cross-examination of the appellant on this
    portion of the note, her counsel objected on several grounds.  After the cross-examination, the trial judge
    agreed to provide a limiting instruction to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that in initially permitting
    cross-examination of the appellant on the hospital record when she was admitted
    to the hospital the impression left with the jury was that the appellant was
    recorded as saying she ran across the road. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant’s counsel submitted in his
    factum that the mid trial correcting instruction telling the jury to give no
    weight to this portion of the cross-examination and the instruction in the
    charge were inadequate, this was not the argument advanced before us.  Rather, counsel submitted that the error was
    incurable.  He agrees that, with the
    benefit of hindsight, he should have moved for a mistrial or moved to have the
    judge dismiss the jury and did not.  He
    says that at the time it was not evident that the statement went to the seminal
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that cross-examination of the appellant on the
    hospital record was not appropriate, we do not agree that the limiting
    instruction given mid trial and in the charge was insufficient to cure any
    prejudice to the appellant.  Accordingly
    we would dismiss this ground of appeal</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE>Issue 2.</span>          Did
    the trial judge err in not specifically charging the jury as to the special
    precautions required of drivers in the particular area where the accident took
    place? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The real issue concerning the adequacy of a jury charge
    is whether the trial judge charged the jury in a fashion that they appreciated
    their duty and were equipped to carry it out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the liability issue was straightforward.  The trial judge told the jury that they should
    consider whether the plaintiff exercised the care expected of a person of
    similar age intelligence and experience.  It was clear that at this point she was
    instructing them on the law.  Following
    this, the trial judge gave an impeccable instruction on the reverse onus on a
    driver who strikes a pedestrian.  She
    then reviewed the positions of the plaintiff and defendant.  There would have been no question in the
    jury’s mind by this point that, in assessing whether the defendant was
    negligent, the circumstances ought to be taken into account.  The trial judge directed the jury to the
    defendant’s evidence that she was not rushing, that she was aware she was
    driving in a residential area, in a neighbourhood containing a YMCA and the
    Memorial Gardens where there was a circus going on.  Although the charge could have been more
    fulsome, the jury would have appreciated the necessity of taking into account
    the defendant’s conduct in the context of driving in that particular area.  Accordingly this ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE>Issue 3.</span>          Did the trial judge err in not
    directing the jury respecting the negligence arising from a driver not seeing
    what was “plainly in view”?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge adequately pointed out the duty on the
    driver to keep a proper lookout in the context of this case and we see no error
    in the trial judge’s refusal to specifically charge on this point.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Overall</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the charge to the jury in respect of
    the other arguments raised by counsel in his factum.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition and Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents do not seek costs and, accordingly
    there will be no award as to costs.</p>
