  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Sean Hall, and Cosmo Jacobson were
    jointly charged with the first degree murder of a security guard, Roy
    Jones.  They were also charged with
    various offences relating to a home invasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The home invasion occurred in 2000.  Jones identified Jacobson when he used a bank
    card stolen during the home invasion to withdraw money from an ATM.  In February 2001, just before the start of
    Jacobson’s preliminary inquiry, Jones was fatally shot as he returned from
    work.  The motive for the murder was to
    prevent Jones from testifying against Jacobson.  The Crown alleged that Jacobson shot Jones, and that the appellant, who
    was Jacobson’s close friend, helped plan the murder and drive the get-away
    car.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s case against the appellant rested mainly on
    three planks: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) the appellant made statements
    amounting to an admission of guilt to undercover officers posing as members and
    associates of the Hell’s Angels in the course of an elaborate “Mr. Big”
    operation; (ii) cell phone records placed the appellant at the scene of the
    murder minutes before it occurred; and, (iii) the appellant tacitly admitted
    his guilt in a telephone conversation with his friend, Nigel Browne.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified in his own defence.  He maintained that he lied to the undercover
    officers about participating in the murder of Jones to impress them and gain
    their trust so they would give him work.  He also claimed that Jacobson borrowed his cell phone the night of the
    murder.  And, he denied admitting his
    guilt to his friend, Browne.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial before Ferguson J. and a jury took ten
    months.  Near the end of the trial, the
    trial judge granted an application for severance because Jacobson sought to use
    recently disclosed evidence that would have prejudiced the appellant.  The trial then continued against the
    appellant alone.  The jury convicted him
    of first degree murder and the home invasion charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his conviction appeal, the appellant makes three
    submissions: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) <span class=GramE>the</span> trial judge erred
    by permitting the Crown to invite the jury to engage in prohibited “propensity”
    reasoning; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) <span class=GramE>the</span> trial judge erred
    in ruling that the appellant had violated the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i>, and in his remedy for the violation; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) <span class=GramE>the</span> trial judge erred
    in instructing the jury on the co-conspirator’s exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We called on the Crown to respond only to the
    appellant’s first submission.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Prohibited propensity
    reasoning</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal arises out of the appellant’s
    conversations with the undercover officers during the “Mr. Big” operation.  The appellant submits that, both in his
    examination of the appellant and in his closing address, the Crown invited the
    jury to use the appellant’s statements to the officers to engage in
    impermissible propensity reasoning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his discussion with the undercover officers, the
    appellant said that he would be willing to carry out crimes with murderers,
    including driving a get-away car, as long as he did not have to wield a
    gun.  The appellant contends that the
    Crown used this evidence improperly – by inviting the jury to conclude that as
    the appellant had acknowledged a propensity to participate in murders, it was
    therefore more likely that he had been willing to assist Jacobson with the
    murder of Jones.  The appellant argues
    that the Crown’s position rendered the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with the appellant’s submission.  As we have said, the appellant testified that
    he lied to the undercover officers about his role in the murder of Jones
    because he hoped to work for them.  During
    cross-examination and closing argument, the Crown asked the jury to conclude
    that the appellant’s trial testimony was implausible and not credible.  The Crown argued the jury should instead
    conclude that the appellant was telling the truth when he told the officers he
    drove the get-away car for Jacobson, and that was why he was prepared to do the
    same thing for persons he believed to be involved in violent crimes.  This was not an invitation to engage in
    impermissible propensity reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the distinction Ms. Klukach drew during
    the course of her submissions on behalf of the Crown.  She distinguished two lines of argument.  The first posits that because the appellant
    was willing to drive for persons he believed to be violent criminals, he was,
    therefore, more likely to have been willing to drive for Jacobson.  The second posits that, as the appellant was
    willing to drive for Jacobson, he was also willing to drive for violent
    criminals.  The first line of argument invites
    the jury to engage in propensity reasoning; the second invites the jury to
    conclude that the appellant was truthful when he told the undercover officers
    he had driven the get-away car for Jacobson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Crown focused almost entirely on the second
    line of argument.  On a few occasions,
    however, the trial Crown put the first line of argument – the propensity
    argument – to the jury.  An example is at
    p. 12769 of the transcript, where he said to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…as he said in his examination in-chief, he was
    prepared to do that.  And in my
    respectful submission to you, if he was prepared to do that for the bikers, he
    was prepared to do that for Cosmo Jacobson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These examples were isolated, and very likely would
    have had no effect on the jury.  Indeed,
    the trial judge’s repeated instructions on bad character evidence alleviated
    any concern that the jury would have used this evidence improperly.  Both during the trial and in his charge, the
    trial judge told the jury that it was not to use bad character evidence for the
    purpose of engaging in propensity reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That no unfairness was occasioned by this evidence or
    the Crown’s use of it is reinforced by the absence of any objection from
    defence counsel.  From the record it is
    apparent that defence counsel was very concerned about the jury’s possible
    misuse of bad character evidence.  During
    his closing argument, defence counsel cautioned the jury not to use this
    evidence to engage in propensity reasoning.  Yet, although defence counsel went on to criticize several aspects of
    the Crown’s closing <span class=GramE>address,</span> he did not criticize the
    aspect the appellant now seeks to challenge on appeal.  Moreover, after having been given an
    extensive opportunity to review the trial judge’s charge before it was given,
    defence counsel did not object to the trial judge’s instructions on bad
    character evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appellant’s main ground of appeal
    must fail.  It is therefore unnecessary
    to address the Crown’s alternative argument that this evidence was admissible
    as situation-specific propensity evidence.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         The <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> ruling   </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel cross-examined Jacobson at length.  He did not, however, cross-examine him on two
    key components of the appellant’s defence: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) unbeknown
    to the appellant, Jacobson had borrowed his cell phone the day of the murder;
    and (ii) Jacobson told the appellant that he had killed Jones with the
    assistance of the “Rampage Crew”.  After
    the appellant testified on these two matters, the Crown asked for a ruling that
    the appellant had violated the rule in <i>Browne
    v. Dunn</i>.  The trial judge so
    ruled.  Then, in his closing address,
    Crown counsel relied on defence counsel’s failure to cross-examine on these two
    matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    ruling that <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> had been
    violated, and that he compounded his error by prohibiting defence counsel from
    telling the jury that the Crown could have recalled Jacobson.  We do not accept this argument for three
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge was correct in ruling that <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> had been violated.  The rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> is a rule of fairness: if counsel is going to
    challenge the credibility of a witness by calling contradictory evidence, the
    witness must be given an opportunity to address the contradictory evidence.  It may be that counsel is not required to put
    every contradictory detail to a witness.  However, the two matters in issue were hardly mere details.  They lay at the heart of the appellant’s
    defence.  The cell phone evidence was
    particularly damaging, unless the appellant could show that someone else was
    using his phone the night of the murder.  We can only conclude that defence counsel, who is both an able and
    experienced criminal defence lawyer, made a tactical decision not to
    cross-examine on these two matters.  His failure
    to do so amounted to a breach <span class=SpellE>to</span> of the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge did not give a general <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> instruction to the jury.  Instead, he let counsel deal with the issue
    in their jury addresses.  The lack of a <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> instruction favoured the
    defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge left open the possibility that
    defence counsel could tell the jury the Crown had a right to call reply
    evidence – a possibility the defence did not pursue.  This was a fair balancing of the respective
    interests of both sides.  On the one
    hand, the trial judge recognized the obvious reluctance of the Crown to recall
    Jacobson: he was not the Crown’s witness; the severance order had been made by
    the time this issue arose; and Jacobson’s propensity for falsehoods on the
    witness stand left the Crown with no idea what he might say about the two
    matters in question.  On the other hand,
    defence counsel had the opportunity to even the balance by telling the jury
    about the Crown’s right to call reply evidence.  As defence counsel precipitated the problem by deciding not to
    cross-examine on the cell phone or the “Rampage Crew” evidence, the trial
    judge’s handling of this issue was fair to the appellant.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         The co-<span
class=SpellE>conspirator’s</span> exception of the hearsay rule</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The so-called <i>Carter</i> instruction on the co-conspirator’s exception of the hearsay rule is
    universally acknowledged to be a complicated instruction and a difficult
    instruction to absorb and apply.  Wherever possible, it is best avoided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the trial judge twice gave a <i>Carter</i> instruction to the jury.  The appellant argues that he erred in doing
    so, that it should not have been given, and that it had the potential to
    confuse the jury.  We do not agree with
    the appellant’s argument.  Even assuming
    the <i>Carter</i> instruction should not
    have been given, it caused no prejudice to the appellant.  On the matters covered by the hearsay
    instruction, the Crown led direct evidence implicating the appellant.  Moreover, defence counsel did not object to
    the <i>Carter</i> instruction and the jury
    asked no questions about it.  The lack of
    objection from counsel or of questions from the jury suggests that the
    instruction was of no consequence during the trial.</p>
