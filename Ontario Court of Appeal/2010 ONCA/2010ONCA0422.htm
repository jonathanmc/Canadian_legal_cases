  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues on this appeal arise out of the trial
    judge’s findings that the appellant committed numerous breaches of an agreement
    made on August 2003 for the breeding of a thoroughbred stallion, named Bold N’
    Flashy.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The corporate appellant operates a stud farm and is
    owned by the appellant Michael Byrne. The respondent owns race horses and is
    owned by a business man, Domenic Romeo. Both men have extensive involvement and
    experience in the horse breeding and horse racing industries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These actions involve the thoroughbred stallion, Bold
    N’ Flashy, which was owned by the respondent, Terra Farm Ltd., and after its
    racing career, stood stud at the farm of the appellant, Park Stud Inc. The
    relationship began with a four-year Breeding Agreement dated December 15, 1995,
    the essential terms of which were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra would supply the stallion for breeding at
    no charge;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Park would absorb all boarding, veterinarian,
    advertising and other expenses;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra would pay insurance premiums;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario sire fees and breeder’s cup fees were to
    be paid jointly;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all revenues from stud fees were to be shared
    equally;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>at the end of the agreement or earlier at Park’s
    option, the stallion would be syndicated with Park as the syndicate manager;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>upon</span> syndication, Park
    could purchase 12 out of 40 shares in the stallion at $4,000 per share.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This agreement was extended by the parties in October
    1999 to December 12, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The stallion began to breed in the 1996 breeding season,
    which ran from February to early June, and continued every year thereafter. In
    December 2001, Park exercised the option to syndicate and purchased its 12 out
    of 40 shares at that time. Thereafter, the expenses of the horse were shared,
    with Park charging Terra 70% of the expenses. However, problems developed in
    the relationship. Terra complained about Park’s reporting and accounting
    format, resulting in a procedural agreement of May 2002 that obliged Park to
    provide monthly reports of stud fees together with payment of fees less
    expenses. Terra also refused to agree to one point in Park’s proposed
    syndication agreement regarding the percentage approval vote required to permit
    major changes in management of the horse. Park had the exclusive right to
    manage the horse, and wanted that to be subject to a 75% ownership vote, while
    Terra would only agree if the percentage required was 66%.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This latter disagreement resulted in an application by
    Terra in 2003 to wind up the partnership. While this litigation was pending,
    Mr. Byrne refused to pay the stud fees owed to Terra for the 2002 breeding season.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The parties and their lawyers met to resolve the issues between them on August
    13, 2003, when the parties entered into a new written agreement. Mr. Byrne’s
    understanding of their agreement was that they were rolling back or undoing the
    steps they had taken toward syndication and joint ownership and reverting back
    to the essential terms of their original agreement except that instead of a
    50/50 split of stud fee revenue, the split was to be 55/45 in favour of Terra.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main terms of the August 13, 2003 agreement by
    which Terra’s action was dismissed were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties recited that their respective
    interests in the stallion were set forth in the original Breeding Agreement
    dated December 15, 1995.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra would provide the stallion to Park for
    breeding purposes at no charge to Terra except for 55% of the Breeder’s Cup
    fees and 100% of the insurance;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the stallion would stand stud at Park for the
    rest of his life subject to Park’s option to terminate the arrangement on 3
    months’ notice;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all “revenues from stud fees” would be shared
    55% Terra and 45% Park, which would be applied retroactively for the 2002
    breeding season;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>on August 1st of each year, Park would provide
    to Terra a list of mares bred, including stud fees and owners’ names and,
    beginning in March each year, on the 15<sup>th</sup> of the month following
    (except August which would be provided in October), Park would provide a
    monthly report of stud fees paid together with a cheque for Terra’s share of
    revenue;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra would repay the share price to Park, Park would
    repay the expenses paid by Terra since December 2001 and Breeder’s Cup and
    insurance obligations would be adjusted back to December 2001;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Park would employ the customary degree of skill
    and care in the management of the stallion but would not be responsible for
    injury, disease or death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this settlement meeting and agreement, in July
    2003, Mr. Byrne, as syndicate manager, had entered the stallion in a newly
    created stallion awards program operated by the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse
    Society (“CTHS”), which program had been approved by the Ontario Racing
    Commission in March 2003. In the application form, Mr. Byrne named Park Stud as
    the party to which the award should be issued. The stallion qualified for the
    program because it was standing stud in Ontario and was enrolled in the Ontario
    Sire Stakes (“OSS”) program. That enrolment had allowed the stallion to race in
    OSS races before its retirement, making it more desirable for breeding. The
    $100 cost of enrolment in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    OSS
    was shared between Terra and Park. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the rules of the new award provided that in
    the event of a change in ownership, the nominator was obliged to advise the CTHS,
    following the August 2003 agreement Mr. Byrne did not notify the CTHS that the
    stallion was now owned exclusively by Terra. Consequently, in January 2004,
    Park received the cheque for $14,529.90 representing the stallion award for the
    previous year, based on the racing success of the stallion’s progeny. Park
    forwarded half the amount to Terra.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Mr. Romeo made his own application to the
    CTHS in respect of the stallion and asserted Terra’s right to receive the whole
    amount of the award, copying Mr.&nbsp;Byrne in the correspondence. After
    learning of this dispute regarding the rights of the parties to this stallion award
    in November 2004, Park discontinued sending the monthly report of stud fee
    revenues to Terra. When the Ontario Racing Commission advised the parties in
    March 2005 that it would not settle their dispute over the right to the
    stallion award, Terra commenced a lawsuit seeking a determination of entitlement
    to the award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Park responded with a letter from Mr. Byrne dated July
    26, 2005. In that letter, Mr. Byrne took the position that the stallion awards
    constituted revenue that should be shared and that if the parties could not
    come to an agreement, then Park would only comply with paragraph 10 of the
    August 2003 agreement, that is to care for the stallion, but would not
    advertise or promote the horse or attempt to attract outside mares for breeding
    “to create stud fee revenue.” If they came to a resolution, then Park would use
    a percentage of the stallion awards for advertising and promotion of the
    stallion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both before and after August 13, 2003, as part of its
    management of the stallion for breeding, Park regularly advertised the stallion
    in thoroughbred magazines, periodicals and the Sire Books that were published
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    .
    Following this letter, Park discontinued all advertising and promotion of the
    stallion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the July 26, 2005 letter, Park also failed to
    make any payment of stud fees including the fees for the 2004 breeding season
    and all subsequent fees right up to the time of trial and continued not to
    report as required by the 2003 agreement. On November 8, 2005, Terra commenced
    the second of the two actions under appeal, claiming relief as a result of
    Park’s breach of the August 2003 agreement.  On the third day of trial, Park paid $97,500
    into court although 55% of the stud fees actually collected for 2004, 2005 and
    2006 was $107,800.</p>
  <h3>Findings of the Trial Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge identified four issues raised by the
    appellants’ trial counsel: (1) who owned the stallion after August 13, 2003; (2)
    who was entitled to the stallion award money; (3) whether the August 2003 agreement
    was terminated by Terra or repudiated by breach by Park; and (4) did the
    withholding of the stud fee revenue by Park constitute a breach of fiduciary duty
    or breach of trust by Park?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing first with the ownership issue, the trial judge
    found that, except for the period when Mr. Byrne (Park) owned 12 out of 40
    shares in the stallion between December 2001 and August 2003, the stallion was
    always owned by Mr. Romeo (Terra). The trial judge found that Mr. Byrne, a man
    with sophisticated business acumen in the stud farm business, made a business
    decision in August 2003 to exchange a 30% ownership interest in the stallion
    for the right to earn 45% of the stud fees for the life of the horse. As the
    stallion was doing very well at the time, it appeared to provide a very
    profitable arrangement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second issue, he found that “revenue from stud
    fees” referred to in the August 2003 agreement, did not include the stallion
    award monies, which could have been specifically included in the agreement by
    Mr. Byrne, who knew about the new award, having just recently applied for it
    for the stallion. As Mr. Byrne (Park) had no contractual right to receive any
    share of the stallion award monies, Terra was entitled to that total revenue.
    Further, Mr. Byrne was obliged to indicate correctly the respective ownership
    interests in the horse on the original application and to <span class=GramE>advise</span> of the change in ownership wholly to Terra after the August 2003 agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the third issue, the trial judge found that by
    fundamentally breaching the August 2003 agreement by failing to report as
    required and by failing to pay over any of the stud fees from the 2004, 2005,
    2006 and 2007 breeding seasons, Park repudiated the agreement, thereby
    depriving Terra of virtually the whole benefit of the agreement and entitling
    Terra to terminate the agreement. Terra accepted Park’s repudiation by
    commencing the lawsuit before the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found that although the August
    2003 agreement did not specifically state that Park had an obligation to
    advertise and promote the stallion, advertising and promotion was clearly part
    of the practice between the parties. In fact, the letter of July 26, 2005,
    indicated Mr. <span class=GramE>Byrne’s understanding</span> that that was his
    obligation. The trial judge concluded that advertising was part of the
    management of the stallion for breeding and failure to advertise constituted a
    breach of Park’s fiduciary duty as the caretaker and manager of the stallion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on these findings and evidence that the trial
    judge accepted regarding what the stallion would have earned had it been
    advertised and promoted after July 2005, the trial judge made the following
    orders against Park: (1)  to return the
    stallion to Terra; (2) to pay the stud fees owed for the 2004 and 2005 breeding
    seasons plus prejudgment interest; (3) to pay damages for breach of contract
    for 2006-2008 of $206,250, based on the amount that the trial judge found Terra
    would have made from its 55% share in stud fee revenues had the contract been
    performed according to its terms; and (4) to pay damages of $100,000 for future
    losses for the following three years that the stallion would be expected to
    breed. The trial judge also ordered both Park and Mr. Byrne jointly to repay $7,265,
    representing one half of the first stallion award that was not paid over to
    Terra. Finally, the trial judge accepted the respondent’s argument that because
    Mr. Byrne was the directing mind of Park and therefore responsible for the
    positions it took in these proceedings, he should be jointly liable with Park
    for costs, which he fixed at $98,520.83.</p>
  <h3>Issues on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge made five
    errors: (1) he misapplied the doctrine of repudiation; (2) he misconstrued the August
    2003 agreement and relied on inadmissible evidence; (3) he erred in finding
    that Terra owed Park a fiduciary duty to advertise the stallion; (4) he erred
    in his calculation of damages and failed to require Terra to mitigate; and (5) he
    erred by holding Mr. Byrne personally liable for the payment of one half of the
    first stallion award and for the costs of the action. </p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that although the trial judge
    referred to the correct five-part test from <i>968703
    Ontario Ltd. v. Vernon</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 215 (C.A.), for fundamental breach
    of contract amounting to repudiation, he failed to properly apply the test to
    the facts. The test, at para. 16, sets out five-factors as guidance in finding
    a fundamental breach:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the ratio of the party's obligation not
    performed to the obligation as a whole; (b) the seriousness of the breach to
    the innocent party; (c) the likelihood of repetition of the breach; (d) the
    seriousness of the consequences of the breach; and (e) the relationship of the
    part of the obligation performed to the whole obligation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants state first that the respondent did not appropriately
    pursue its repudiation claim, because it did not attempt to retrieve possession
    of the stallion and because its original claim was for rescission of the
    agreement, which claim was only amended shortly before trial to claim
    repudiation. Park also relies on the fact that it continued to feed and care
    for the horse according to the agreement as evidence that Terra was not
    deprived of the whole benefit of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these arguments. With respect to
    retrieving possession of the horse, the trial judge found that Park
    consistently resisted Terra’s claim for an order to return the stallion. On the
    pleading point, Park argues that by the time the pleading was amended, Park was
    entitled to believe that the August 2003 agreement was still in effect.
    However, Park could not have believed the agreement continued in effect when as
    found by the trial judge, it refused to carry out its critical obligations
    under the agreement: to report on the breeding activity of the stallion and to
    pay the resulting stud fees. It certainly does not lie with Park to rely on the
    fact that it continued to feed and care for the horse when it would not return
    the horse to Terra, its rightful owner, once it was no longer abiding by the
    terms of the agreement by which the stallion was standing stud at the Park Stud
    farm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue raised on appeal relates to entitlement
    to the stallion award monies. The appellant’s first objection is to the trial
    judge’s interpretation of the phrase “revenue from stud fees” in the August 2003
    agreement as meaning only stud fees and no other type of revenue that might be
    generated by the stallion including award monies. The appellants object that
    the trial judge erred by looking to the prior dealings of the parties to assist
    in the interpretation of the phrase. In my view, the trial judge made no error
    either in his analysis or in his conclusion regarding the meaning of the phrase
    within the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In interpreting the phrase, the trial judge looked to
    the agreement as a whole as well as to the plain language of the phrase. To the
    extent that there could be any argument of ambiguity, he examined the past
    dealings between the parties as an indication of how they interpreted the
    phrase in practice. The appellants submit that the trial judge gave no meaning
    to the words “revenue from” and say that revenue from stud fees includes any
    revenue “derived from stud fees”, by which it means generated by the breeding
    of the horse including but not limited to stud fees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject this submission. First, the trial judge made
    no error in his approach to the interpretation of the phrase within the context
    of the agreement as a whole. Second, his conclusion was not only <span
class=GramE>reasonable,</span> it was in accordance with the practice of the
    parties as well as the language they used. If the parties had intended to
    include all revenues generated as a result of the breeding of the stallion
    including revenues earned by its progeny, they could have said so. As the trial
    judge correctly noted, Mr. Byrne was the only one of the two men who was aware
    of the new stallion award, so that if he had intended to include any award
    monies, he was the one to ensure that the August 2003 agreement referred to
    such monies. The term “stud fees” is unambiguous. Revenue from stud fees is
    essentially redundant verbiage, but this does not detract from the meaning of
    the phrase. I find no error in the approach or the interpretation determined by
    the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as the appellants point out in their factum,
    the purpose of interpreting the phrase was to assist in determining which party
    was entitled under their agreement to the stallion award money. The trial judge
    found on that issue that it was the owner of the horse who was entitled to
    receive the award monies and that was the respondent. This finding was not moot
    as the appellants contend, but necessary to determine entitlement, once it was
    clear that the issue was not addressed in the August 2003 agreement. The appellants
    also point to the fact that the trial judge failed to consider that because the
    parties shared the $100 OSS fee, they intended to share the stallion award. However,
    the OSS fee was not the application fee for the stallion award. The trial judge
    made no error on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant next submits that the trial judge erred
    by attributing to the parties a fiduciary relationship, when their relationship
    is merely governed by the contract between them, and, as horse breeder and
    horse owner, is not one of the traditionally recognized fiduciary
    relationships. The context for this submission is the trial judge’s finding
    that Park breached a fiduciary duty when it threatened to and then did discontinue
    advertising the stallion for breeding in the trade magazines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on the principle from <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377,
    at pp. 409-10, that where the relationship is not within one of the recognized
    categories of fiduciary relationship, then “what is required is evidence of a
    mutual understanding that one party has relinquished its own self-interest and
    agreed to act solely on behalf of the other party.” In this case, the contract
    between the parties set out obligations that Park was to carry out for the
    benefit of both parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is unnecessary in this case to find a
    fiduciary relationship. The trial judge found that although the obligation to
    advertise and promote the stallion was not specifically listed in the August
    2003 agreement, it was “clearly part of the practice between the parties and
    was anticipated to carry on”. Although the trial judge uses this analysis to conclude
    that Park owed Terra a fiduciary duty to advertise and promote the stallion, the
    effect of his finding is that Park’s obligation to advertise and promote was an
    implied term of the August 2003 agreement as part of its management of the
    stallion for breeding. The trial judge made this finding based on the
    intentions of the parties, demonstrated by their conduct, by their practice and
    the practice in the industry and by the evidence of Mr. Byrne. Park advertised
    and promoted all of the stallions that stood stud at its farm including Bold N’
    Flashy. It advertised Bold N’ Flashy both before and after the August 2003
    agreement until Byrne unilaterally decided not to do so following his July 2005
    letter. As the whole purpose of the arrangement was to breed the stallion to as
    many mares as possible, advertising and promoting the stallion was a necessary
    component of the breeder’s obligations. Finally, the 1995 written agreement
    between the parties did refer to advertising as one of Park’s obligations. In
    his evidence regarding the August 2003 settlement agreement, Mr. Byrne stated
    that the intention was to revert to the previous arrangement. In my view, the
    trial judge was correct in the findings he made that advertising and promotion were
    part of Park’s obligations as breeder under the August 2003 agreement. However,
    those findings lead to the legal conclusion of an implied term in the August
    2003 agreement rather than the imposition of a fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of damages, the appellants submit that the
    trial judge did not give effect to the evidence of their expert, Mr. McCormack,
    in contrast to the respondent’s expert report of Mr. Hogan. I would not give
    effect to this submission. The trial judge is the one who assesses and weighs
    the evidence and decides what evidence to accept or reject. This court accords
    deference to his decision on these issues. The appellants also argue that the
    respondent failed to mitigate by not repossessing the horse. I have already
    addressed this submission in the context of the repudiation argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final issue is whether the trial judge erred by
    holding Mr. Byrne personally liable for the costs of the litigation and for the
    half of the stallion award from 2003. Dealing first with the stallion award
    money from 2003, the respondent’s action in respect of the award was brought
    against both Park Stud and Byrne. However, on the evidence, although Mr. Byrne
    was the actor through which Park Stud conducted its affairs, there is no
    evidence that he was the personal recipient of the award money. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of costs, the trial judge in effect pierced
    the corporate veil and found that as Mr. Byrne was the directing mind of Park,
    all of its actions including in the litigation, were really Mr. Byrne’s actions
    and taken for Mr. Byrne’s benefit. In awarding the costs of both actions, he
    made one award, although Mr. Byrne was only a party to the stallion award claim
    and not to the second action regarding the repudiation of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The test for
    when a court may pierce the corporate veil of a one shareholder corporation
    requires not only that the shareholder controls the actions of the corporation
    but that that control is exercised to allow the corporation to be used for a
    fraudulent or improper purpose: see <i>642947
    Ontario Ltd. v. Fleischer</i> (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at paras. 67-68.
    In this case, Park’s actions, taken by Mr. Byrne, were in breach of the
    agreement. The trial judge made adverse findings regarding Mr. Byrne’s
    credibility and found that his conduct in failing to advertise the stallion
    after July 2005 was deliberate and vindictive. He also found that by retaining
    the horse, and not allowing the respondent to retake possession, he prevented
    the respondent from obtaining the full benefit from the horse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although these actions by Mr. Byrne on behalf of Park constituted
    a hardball strategic approach, the trial judge made no finding of a fraudulent
    or improper purpose, which is a very high test. I would therefore set aside the
    award of costs against Mr. Byrne in his personal capacity.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would allow the appeal only in respect
    of the orders against Mr.&nbsp;Byrne, but dismiss the appeal in respect of the
    orders against Park.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the respondent was substantially successful, I would
    award costs of the appeals to the respondent, but at a reduced amount to
    reflect the partial success of Mr. Byrne. The respondent claimed $19,970 on a
    partial indemnity basis. I would award $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>

    fee is generally only paid after a foal is born alive. After mares are bred to
    the stallions in the late winter and spring, an 11-month gestation period
    ensues. Mare owners will pay the stud fee between this live birth and the
    following autumn.  Therefore, stud fees
    will generally not be received until the calendar year subsequent to the
    breeding season.</p>
