  <p class=MsoHeader style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 4(6) of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, <span class=GramE>c</span>. C-5 prohibits a
    trial judge or Crown counsel from commenting on an accused’s failure to testify.  The interpretation of that provision gives
    rise to three questions on this appeal:</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'></span></span>Does s. 4(6) prohibit a trial judge from
    instructing a jury that it cannot use an accused’s silence at trial as evidence
    of guilt?</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'></span></span>If s. 4(6) does preclude that instruction, is
    the section unconstitutional and of no force and effect?</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'></span></span>If s. 4(6) does not preclude that instruction, did
    the trial judge’s failure to give that instruction in this case constitute
    reversible error?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, relying on <i>R. v. Crawford</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858 and <i>R. v. Noble</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, concluded that s. 4(6) prohibited
    him from telling the jury that it could not use the accused’s silence at trial
    as evidence against him.  The trial judge
    made it clear that, but for his understanding of the prohibition in s. 4(6), he
    would have given that instruction to counteract certain comments made by counsel
    for the co-accused in his closing address.  The jury convicted the appellant and his co-accused.  The co-accused has not appealed.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>Counsel for the appellant and Crown
    counsel agree that the comments in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> relied on by the trial
    judge are</span> <i>obiter dicta</i> and not
    binding on this court.  Counsel further agree
    that s. 4(6), properly interpreted, and as interpreted by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in at least three decisions prior to <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i>, does not preclude a trial
    judge from telling a jury that it cannot use an accused’s silence at trial against
    him.  The appellant goes on to argue that
    the trial judge’s failure to give that instruction constitutes reversible
    error.  In making this submission,
    counsel places heavy reliance on the trial judge’s statement that, had he
    thought that s. 4(6) permitted the instruction, he would have told the jury
    that it could not use the appellant's silence at trial as evidence of
    guilt.  The Crown submits that, while the
    trial judge could have given the instruction sought by the appellant, the
    absence of that instruction, when considered in light of the entire charge to
    the jury, did not compromise the verdict.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, the appellant argues that s. 4(6)
    is unconstitutional if the statements in<i> Crawford</i> and<i> Noble</i> are binding
    and the trial judge correctly held that he could not tell the jury that it could
    not use the accused’s silence against him.  This court has previously held that s. 4(6) is constitutional:<i>  R.
    v. Boss</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (Ont. C.A.).  As the constitutional argument could be
    accepted only if<i> Boss</i> is overruled, a
    five-judge panel heard this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the issues surrounding s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, the appellant raises
    two further grounds on his appeal from conviction.  He also appeals against sentence.  Finally, the appellant raises issues arising
    out of delays in the perfection of the appeal which, the appellant contends, are
    attributable to the Crown and have caused prejudice to the appellant.  The delays are relevant only to remedy,
    should this court decide that the appeal should succeed and the convictions should
    be quashed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the conviction appeal.  I agree with counsel for the appellant and Crown
    counsel that s. 4(6) does not prohibit an instruction to the jury that an
    accused’s failure to testify cannot be used against that accused.  So interpreted, s. 4(6) is constitutional.  I agree with the Crown that the trial judge’s
    instructions to the jury, considered as a whole, were adequate despite the
    absence of any specific reference to the appellant’s right not to testify.  There is no merit to the other grounds raised
    on the conviction appeal, and I will address them only very briefly at the end
    of these reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also dismiss the sentence appeal.  The three-year sentence imposed was fit given
    the nature of the fraud and the appellant’s central role in its commission.     </p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>II</span></b></h1>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and his co-accused, Peter Solty, were
    charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the Government of Canada and
    one count of defrauding the Government of Canada of about $3.25 million.  The Crown alleged that both accused
    participated in a fraudulent scheme involving the fictitious sale of heavy
    equipment to generate Harmonized Sales Tax (“HST”) that was then not remitted to
    the federal government as required.  The
    fraudulent nature of the scheme was never challenged.  The involvement of the appellant and Mr. Solty
    in the scheme was also conceded.  The
    question for the jury was whether either or both accused were aware of the
    fraudulent nature of the scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to summarize the evidence or describe
    the scheme in any detail.  There was
    direct evidence from Andrew Tulloch, a participant in the scheme, detailing the
    appellant’s role as the principal architect of the scheme.  There was also a great deal of documentary
    evidence implicating the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The co-accused, Mr. Solty, testified.  It was his contention that he was duped into
    participating in the fraudulent scheme by the appellant.  He insisted that he was unaware of the
    fraudulent nature of the scheme devised and orchestrated by the appellant.     Counsel for the appellant challenged Mr. Solty’s
    credibility.  He sought to demonstrate
    that Mr. Solty had a strong animus toward the appellant, in part because Mr. Solty’s
    wife had left Mr. Solty and was living with the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his address to the jury, counsel for Mr. Solty drew
    the jury’s attention to the fact that his client had testified and the
    appellant had not.  Counsel put it this
    way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It’s
    clear that Mr. Solty never ran and ever tried to hide from his involvement in
    this case ... And when it came to his turn to tell his side of the story, he
    did not, like Ewaryst Prokofiew, shirk from that challenge.  And why did he do all this?  Especially when there was absent no obligation
    [sic] for him to do anything?  Because, I
    suggest, he had nothing to hide.  <span
class=GramE>Because he’s innocent.</span>  Innocent people don’t make themselves scarce when the troubles
    begin.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lastly, Peter Solty took the stand and told his
    story, warts and all.  Ewaryst Prokofiew
    did not.  Mr. Solty accused him of massive
    monetary fraud, and backed up that accusation with the hand-written invoices
    and other documentation that he provided to the police.  What was Mr. Prokofiew’s response?  Ask yourself why Ewaryst Prokofiew did not
    testify.  Did he have something to hide
    or did he simply have no response that could help him since there is no point
    in trying to contradict the truth?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Mr. Solty was entitled to comment on the
    appellant’s failure to testify.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Section 4(6) has no application to counsel
    for a co-accused:  <i>Crawford</i> at para. 24; <i>R. v.
    Naglik</i> (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 272 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 281-85, rev’d on other
    grounds [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122; <i>R. v. Oliver
    and Morrison</i> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 65; <i>R. v. Pollock</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 213
    (Ont. C.A.) at para. 149.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was concerned that the comments made by
    counsel for Mr. Solty could undermine the appellant’s right to a fair trial by
    encouraging the jury to infer the appellant’s guilt from his failure to testify.  The trial judge proposed to make it clear to
    the jury that the appellant’s silence at trial could not be used in that
    way.  However, after hearing submissions
    from counsel and reviewing <i>Crawford </i>and <i>Noble</i>, the trial judge concluded that
    s. 4(6) precluded him from telling the jury that it could not use the
    appellant’s silence at trial as evidence against him.  The trial judge made no specific reference to
    the appellant’s failure to testify in his instructions. </p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>III</span></b></h1>
  <h3>THE INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 4(6) OF THE <i>CANADA EVIDENCE ACT</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Section 4(6)
    reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The failure of the person charged, or of the wife
    or husband of that person, to testify shall not be made the subject of comment
    by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read literally, the word “comment” in s. 4(6) could
    include a reference of any kind to the fact that an accused did not
    testify.  The section was read that way in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i>.  In <i>Crawford</i>, at para. 22, Sopinka J., in
    describing the right to silence at trial, indicated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he matter has been complicated by the specific
    statutory provision in s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i> which forbids the trial judge and Crown counsel from
    commenting on the failure of the accused to testify.  <u>This encompasses both <span class=GramE>comment</span> prejudicial to the accused, as well as a direction that the jury must not draw
    an unfavourable conclusion from the accused’s failure to testify.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sopinka J. used similar language when speaking for the majority
    in <i>Noble</i>, at para. 95, two years
    later:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 4(6), whose validity is not in issue in the
    present case, prevents a trial judge from commenting on the silence of the
    accused.  <u>The trial judge is therefore
    prevented from instructing the jury on the impermissibility of using silence to
    take the case against the accused to one that proves guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The observations as to the scope of s. 4(6) did not
    form part of the <i>ratio decidendi</i> in
    either <i>Crawford</i> or <i>Noble</i>.  <i>Crawford</i> addressed the extent to
    which an accused could cross-examine his co-accused on the co-accused's failure
    to make a statement to the police, and the instruction that a trial judge
    should give in the face of that cross-examination.  <i>Noble</i>, <span class=GramE>which</span> involved a single accused tried by judge alone,
    considered whether a trier of fact was entitled to use an accused’s failure to
    testify as a “make-weight” when deciding whether the Crown had met its burden
    of proof.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Characterization of the comments concerning s. 4(6) in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> as <i>obiter dicta</i> does not, however, determine whether those comments are binding on this court.  In <i>R.
    v. Henry</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, Binnie J., writing for a unanimous court,
    recognized that <i>stare decisis</i> commands compliance not only with the <i>ratio
    decidendi</i>, but some of the <i>obiter</i> from the Supreme Court of Canada. He put it in these terms at para. 57:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>All <i>obiter</i> do not have, and are not intended to have, the same weight.  The weight decreases as one moves from the
    dispositive <i>ratio decidendi</i> to a
    wider circle of analysis which is obviously intended for guidance and which
    should be accepted as authoritative.</u>  Beyond that, there will be commentary, examples or exposition that are
    intended to be helpful and may be found to be persuasive, but are certainly not
    “binding” <span class=GramE>… .</span> <u>The objective of the exercise is to
    promote certainty in the law, not to stifle its growth and creativity.  The notion that each phrase in a judgment of
    this Court should be treated as if enacted in a statute is not supported by the
    cases and is inconsistent with the basic fundamental principle that the common
    law develops by experience.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question then becomes the following: how does one
    distinguish between binding <i>obiter</i> in
    a Supreme Court of Canada judgment and non-binding <i>obiter</i>?  In <i>Henry</i> at para. 53, Binnie J. explains
    that one must ask, “What does the case actually decide?”  Some cases decide only a narrow point in a specific
    factual context.  Other cases - including
    the vast majority of Supreme Court of Canada decisions - decide broader legal
    propositions and, in the course of doing so, set out legal analyses that have
    application beyond the facts of the particular case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Obiter dicta</i> will move along a continuum.  A legal pronouncement
    that is integral to the result or the analysis that underlies the determination
    of the matter in any particular case will be binding.  <i>Obiter </i>that
    is incidental or collateral to that analysis should not be regarded as binding,
    although it will obviously remain persuasive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lower courts should be slow to characterize <i>obiter dicta</i> from the Supreme Court of
    Canada as non-binding.  It is best to
    begin from the premise that all <i>obiter </i>from
    the Supreme Court of Canada should be followed, and to move away from that premise
    only where a reading of the relevant judgment provides a cogent reason for not applying
    that <i>obiter</i>.  The orderly and rational development of the jurisprudence
    is not served if lower courts are too quick to strike out in legal directions
    different than those signalled in <i>obiter </i>from
    the Supreme Court of Canada.  Having
    stressed the need for caution when deciding whether to characterize <i>obiter </i>from the Supreme Court of Canada
    as non-binding and to decline to follow that <i>obiter</i>, I will now set out the reasons why I think the <i>obiter</i> in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> are not
    binding and should not be followed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My first reason for treating the <i>obiter</i> <i>dicta </i>in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> as non-binding is based on the pre-existing s. 4(6) jurisprudence
    from the Supreme Court of Canada.  No
    authority is cited in either <i>Crawford</i> or <span class=GramE><i>Noble</i></span> for
    the proposition that s. 4(6) precludes a trial judge from instructing the jury
    that it cannot use an accused's failure to testify as evidence of guilt.  There is strong authority from the Supreme
    Court of Canada predating <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> declaring that such
    comments are not contrary to s. 4(6):  <i>R. v. McConnell and Beer</i>, [1968] S.C.R.
    802; <i>R. v. Avon</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 650; <i>R. v. Vézeau</i> [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277 at pp.
    289-90; <i>R. v. Potvin</i> [1989] 1 S.C.R.
    525 at pp. 557-58; see also <i>Report of the
    Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence </i>(Toronto:
    Carswell, 1982) at pp. 342-43 and 353-56.  This line of authority was not referred to in either <i>Crawford</i> or <i>Noble</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>McConnell and
    Beer</i>, as reproduced at p. 815, the trial judge told the jury in a recharge
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t was pointed out that in the course of my
    charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept the explanations of the
    accused because those explanations were not made under oath.  You are not to take from that that there is
    any onus upon the accused to prove their innocence by going into the witness
    box and testifying in their defence.  There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal
    trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying
    in their own defence.  <u>You are not to
    be influenced in your decision by either of the accused not going into the
    witness box and <span class=GramE>testifying ...</span> .</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the argument that the trial judge’s instructions
    contravened s. 4(5) of the <i>Canada Evidence
    Act</i> [now s. 4(6)], Ritchie J., for the majority, said at p. 809:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Here the language used by the trial judge to
    which objection is taken was not so much a “comment” on the failure of the
    persons charged to testify as a statement of their right to refrain from doing
    so, and it does not appear to me that it should be taken to have been the
    intention of Parliament in enacting s. 4(5) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> to preclude judges from explaining to juries
    the law with respect to the rights of accused persons in this regard.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Avon</i>, as
    reproduced at p. 653, the trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The accused did not testify.  Evidently, he could have done so.  He is not obliged to do so.  I must tell you immediately, because it is
    better to say it, it is not because the accused did not testify that you should
    believe that he could be guilty.  <u>His
    absence from the witness box, the fact that he did not testify and did not call
    any witnesses, has nothing to do with the trial.</u>  <span class=GramE>Because you will have come
    to your decision only on the well-established principle that the Crown must
    prove and establish the guilt of the accused.</span>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the claim that the trial judge’s
    instructions contravened s. 4(5) of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i> [now s. 4(6)], the majority in <i>Avon</i> observed at p. 655:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I would say that the language used by [the trial
    judge] is a <u>“statement” of an accused’s right to testify, rather than a
    “comment” on his failure to do so.  In my
    opinion, the instructions complained of cannot be construed as prejudicial to
    the accused or such as to suggest to the jurors that his silence was used to
    cloak his guilt.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extracts from <i>McConnell
    and Beer</i> and <i>Avon</i> quoted above
    were undoubtedly part of the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of those cases.  To my knowledge, the Supreme
    Court of Canada has not questioned the correctness of those decisions in any subsequent
    case.  In <i>Potvin</i>, the majority expressly approved of the reasoning in <i>McConnell and Beer</i> as consistent with
    the proper approach to statutory interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court is, therefore, presented with a clear
    conflict between the <i>obiter dicta</i> in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> and the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of prior Supreme Court of Canada decisions.  To treat the <i>obiter</i> as binding
    would be to disregard the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the earlier cases.  One of the primary
    reasons for treating <i>obiter </i>as
    binding is to preserve and promote certainty in the application of the
    law.  Given the entirety of the s. 4(6)
    jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada, the goal of certainty would not
    be served by treating the <i>obiter </i>in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> as binding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the years subsequent to <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i>, this
    court has repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the distinction drawn in <i>McConnell and Beer</i> and <i>Avon</i> between a statement of an accused’s
    right not to testify, which does not contravene s. 4(6), and a potentially
    prejudicial comment on an accused’s failure to testify, which does contravene
    the section:  see <i>R. v. Miller</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 11; <i>R. v. Knox</i> (2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 515
    (C.A.); <i>R. v. Baldwin</i> (2004), 192

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Baldwin</i>,<i> </i>at para. 26, Laskin J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Supreme Court has said repeatedly that the
    prohibition in s. 4(6) must be applied purposively, not literally.  The section was obviously enacted for the
    protection of an accused:  a jury may
    improperly conclude from a judge’s comment on an accused’s failure to testify
    that the accused is using silence as a “cloak” for guilt.  Therefore, to run afoul of s. 4(6) more is
    required than a mere offhand comment on an accused’s failure to testify.  <u>To contravene the section, the comment
    must give rise to a realistic risk of prejudice to the accused’s defence.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Biladeau</i>,
    at para. 20, Sharpe J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It has been consistently held that s. 4(6) must be
    interpreted in light of its purpose rather than in a literal or mechanical
    fashion.  Accordingly, <u>the provision
    will not be violated where the trial judge explains to the jury that the
    accused has a constitutional right not to testify and that the burden of
    proving the case always rests with the Crown, provided the instruction is not “presented
    to the jury in such a fashion as to suggest that … silence is being used as a
    cloak for … guilt”. </u>  [Citation
    omitted; emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from <i>Crawford </i>and<i> Noble</i>, there is a second line
    of s. 4(6) jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada that arguably
    prohibits an instruction that an accused’s failure to testify cannot be used
    against him.  Some argue that <i>Vézeau</i> supports the proposition that s.
    4(6) precludes a trial judge from telling a jury that it cannot draw an adverse
    inference from the accused’s failure to testify:  see H. Stewart, “Nothing Can Come of
    Nothing:  Three Implications of <i>Noble</i>” (1999), 42 Crim. L.Q. 286 at p. 307; <i>Boss</i> at pp. 533-534.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that, prior to <i>Noble</i>, an instruction to the effect that no adverse inference could
    be drawn from an accused’s failure to testify had been held to be wrong in
    law.  However, that holding had nothing
    to do with the prohibition in s. 4(6) but instead reflected the pre-<i>Noble</i> law, which allowed triers of fact to
    draw an adverse inference from an accused’s failure to testify.  The instruction was seen as improper not
    because it offended s. 4(6), but because it was wrong in law.  Charron J.A. explained the distinction in <i>Miller</i>, at para. 7:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> prohibits a judge from commenting to the jury
    on the failure of an accused to testify.  From a reading of <i>Noble</i> in its
    entirety, it is clear that this is entirely separate and distinct from the <u>question
    of when a trier of fact may draw an adverse inference from the failure of an
    accused to testify.  One is a blanket
    prohibition against comments and the other is a general rule, with exceptions,
    as to what inferences can be drawn.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Noble</i> clearly
    changed the law with respect to the use that could be made of an accused’s
    failure to testify.  Authorities that,
    like <i>Vézeau</i>, explicitly recognized
    the right to draw an adverse inference from the failure of an accused to
    testify have been overtaken by <i>Noble</i> and limited to the defence of alibi.  After <i>Noble</i>, leaving aside s. 4(6), an
    instruction that the jury could not use an accused's failure to testify against
    that accused would be a correct statement of the law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the prevailing Supreme Court of Canada
    jurisprudence prior to <i>Noble</i> and <i>Crawford</i> is in direct conflict with the <i>obiter</i> in those two cases.  This court has continued to apply the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the earlier
    cases.  To abandon that path and follow
    the <i>obiter </i>in <i>Noble</i> and <i>Crawford</i> at
    this juncture would promote neither consistency nor predictability, which are the
    twin goals served by the principle of <i>stare
    decisis</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My second reason for treating the <i>obiter</i> in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> as non-binding arises out of the peripheral
    role played by that <i>obiter </i>in the
    reasoning in both cases.  The reference
    to s. 4(6) in <i>Crawford</i> is part of a
    brief description of the accused’s right to silence at trial.  The case itself was concerned with how best
    to reconcile the competing fair trial interests of co-accused.  The observation of Sopinka J. as to the scope
    of s. 4(6) was merely part of the constitutional backdrop to his analysis of how
    the competing interests of co-accused should be balanced in a joint trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>ratio
    decidendi</i> of <i>Noble</i> speaks to the impact
    of the presumption of innocence and the right to silence on the use that can be
    made of the accused’s failure to testify at trial.  The majority held that those rights preclude a
    trier of fact from drawing any adverse evidentiary inference from an accused’s
    failure to testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reference to s. 4(6) by Sopinka J. in <i>Noble </i>was not made in the course of
    building his case for an interpretation of the right to silence and the
    presumption of innocence that would foreclose the jury’s drawing of an adverse
    inference from an accused’s failure to testify.  Instead, Sopinka J. discussed s. 4(6) in the context of acknowledging
    that, in jury cases, there were certain unavoidable impediments to the full
    realization of the constitutional rights to silence and the presumption of
    innocence as developed in <i>Noble</i>.  Sopinka J. regarded the prohibition in s. 4(6)
    as one of those impediments, in that it prevented a trial judge from telling a
    jury that the accused had the constitutional right not to testify and that the
    exercise of that right could not redound against him at trial.  Consequently, not only was the interpretation
    of s. 4(6) not integral to the analysis underlying the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of <i>Noble</i>,
    but that interpretation potentially undermined the effective exercise of the
    very rights recognized in <i>Noble</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inconsistency between the <i>ratio decidendi</i> in <i>Noble</i> and the interpretation of s. 4(6) in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i> leads me to my third reason
    for treating that <i>obiter</i> as
    non-binding.  As Professor Stewart points
    out in “Nothing Can Come of Nothing:  Three Implications of <i>Noble</i>”
    at pp. 309-10, the interpretation of s. 4(6) in <i>McConnell and Beer</i> and <i>Avon</i> promotes the effective exercise of the constitutional rights to silence and the
    presumption of innocence as recognized in <i>Noble</i>.  These cases do so by permitting a trial judge
    to tell a jury that an accused who does not testify is exercising his or her
    constitutional right and that no adverse inference can be drawn from that failure
    to testify.  Adherence to the earlier
    jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada removes one of the features of
    the jury trial that Sopinka J. identified in <i>Noble</i> as an impediment to the full realization of the
    constitutional rights recognized in <i>Noble</i>.  Ironically, it is the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the earlier cases that fits more comfortably
    with the constitutional vision articulated in <i>Noble</i>.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, I agree with counsel for
    the appellant and Crown counsel that this court should not apply the <i>obiter dicta</i> in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Noble</i>, but
    should continue to interpret s. 4(6) as that provision was interpreted in <i>McConnell and Beer</i> and <i>Avon</i>.  On that interpretation, no argument is advanced that s. 4(6) is
    unconstitutional.  The constitutional holding
    in <i>Boss</i> stands.  </p>

  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p><b>THE JURY INSTRUCTION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury was not told that it could not use the
    appellant’s silence at trial as evidence against him.  The trial judge would have given this
    instruction had he thought himself permitted to do so by law.  The trial judge’s assessment of the need for
    that kind of instruction given the comments of counsel for Mr. Solty is an
    important consideration in determining whether the non-direction constitutes
    misdirection.  However, the trial judge's
    assessment of the situation is not conclusive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court must examine the entirety of the
    instructions in the context of the submissions made by counsel for Mr. Solty and
    counsel for the appellant to determine whether there is a real risk that the
    jury may have used the appellant’s silence as evidence against him in arriving
    at their verdicts.  Obviously, no one
    knows for sure what the jury used or did not use.  In my view, if the appellant shows a real
    risk that his silence was misused, that is enough to characterize the
    non-direction as misdirection.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The adequacy of the instruction can only be resolved by
    reference to several passages from the trial record.  I begin with comments made by counsel for the
    appellant in his closing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Prokofiew, as [counsel for Mr. Solty] pointed
    out, chose not to testify in this case.  There are many jurisdictions in the world that are, frankly, not as kind
    as ours; that when a person has an allegation against them, that they have to
    stand up; you’re alleged to do this; or you prove to us, you tell us why you
    are not guilty.  That is not, thankfully,
    the way things are done here in Canada.  <u>We
    have the luxury and we have the thankfulness that we have a system that
    requires the State to prove our guilt before a conviction or a finding of guilt
    can be entered.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>In this situation, this is the situation why Mr.
    Prokofiew does not have to call evidence, and this is why Mr. Prokofiew did not
    call evidence.</u>  In the context of counsel
    for Mr. Solty’s statement, well, yes, Mr. Solty testified, but with respect,
    Mr. Solty had no choice but to testify.  He was implicated at every turn of these transactions.  He was in transactions up to his neck.  And as a result, with respect to him, he had
    no choice but to take the stand.  In
    response to Mr. Prokofiew, as I will mention in my submission, the evidence
    comes down to the evidence of Mr. Tulloch, and juxtaposed by the evidence of
    Peter Solty.  <u>With the greatest respect
    to them, their evidence does not come close to establishing guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt in this case.  And in
    the context of what Mr. Solty testified to will simply adjust the position of
    the evidence of Mr. Tulloch.  <span
class=GramE>Nothing more, nothing less.</span></u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury would understand these comments as a direct
    response to the submissions made earlier by counsel for Mr. Solty, reproduced
    above at para. 11.  Certainly, the trial
    judge made it absolutely clear to the jury that the Crown carried the burden of
    proof throughout the proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, early in his instructions, told the
    jury that its verdict had to be based on the evidence and that the jury could
    not speculate about what additional evidence might have been called:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As judges of the facts, your first duty is to
    decide what the facts are in this case.  You make that decision from all of the evidence given during the
    trial.  There will be no more
    evidence.  You will consider nothing
    else.  You are entitled to come to common
    sense conclusions based on the evidence that you accept.  You must not speculate, however, about what
    evidence there might have been or permit yourself to guess or make up theories
    without evidence to support them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge returned to the same theme a few
    paragraphs later, reminding the jury, “Under our system of law, you [determine
    the verdict] on the basis of the evidence put before you, and only on that
    evidence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of his instructions, the trial judge
    defined evidence as follows: “Only things that are admitted, the exhibits and
    the things witnesses say in testimony before you, are evidence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s explanation of the presumption of
    innocence also made it clear that the appellant had no obligation to testify or
    otherwise disprove his guilt: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The presumption of innocence means that both Mr.
    Prokofiew and Mr. Solty started the trial as innocent persons.  The presumption stays with them throughout
    the case, including your deliberations at the end of the trial.  It is only defeated if and when Crown counsel
    has satisfied all of you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that either or both Mr.
    Prokofiew and Mr. Solty are guilty of either or both of the crimes with which
    they are each charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge next tied the presumption of innocence
    into the burden of proof in a manner that spoke almost directly to the
    irrelevance of the appellant’s failure to testify:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Solty and Mr. Prokofiew do not have to present
    evidence or prove anything in this case.  In particular, they do not have to prove that they are innocent of the
    crimes charged.  From start to finish, it
    is the Crown that must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is Crown counsel who must prove Mr.
    Solty’s guilt and/or Mr. Prokofiew’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not Mr.
    Prokofiew or Mr. Solty who must prove their innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in reference to the application of the
    reasonable doubt standard, the trial judge reminded the jury that it could
    convict the appellant only if “after considering all of the evidence [they were]
    sure that Mr. Prokofiew committed an offence charged”.  In contrast, in explaining the basis upon
    which an acquittal could be entered, the trial judge made it clear that the
    absence of evidence could give rise to a reasonable doubt:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If at the end of the case, <u>based on all of the
    evidence or the lack of evidence,</u> you are not sure that Mr. Prokofiew
    committed an offence, you should find him not guilty of it.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking into account the entirety of the instructions, I
    am satisfied that the jury would understand that the Crown could prove the
    appellant’s guilt based only on the evidence, and that the appellant’s silence at
    trial - or indeed, any other non-evidentiary matter - could not be used to
    infer the appellant’s guilt.  That is not
    to say that the jury would not look at what was a very formidable case for the
    Crown in a different light given the absence of any explanation from the
    appellant for the mass of incriminating evidence.  As explained in <i>Noble</i> at para. 282, a trier of fact will inevitably, as part of its
    deliberative process, weigh the Crown’s case against the evidence, if any, that
    conflicts with that case.  The appellant
    could point to precious little that conflicted with the Crown’s case on this
    record.  </p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>V</span></b></h1>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>THE OTHER GROUNDS OF
    APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    holding that certain handwritten notations in the deposit book and cheque stubs
    belonging to Discount Sales, one of the companies through which the proceeds of
    the fraud were funnelled, were admissible hearsay.  The trial judge held that the notation “E” on
    some of the documents was admissible to identify the appellant, whose first
    name began with the letter “E”, as one of the recipients of the money funnelled
    through Discount Sales.  The appellant
    contends that the author of the notations was never identified and that there
    were no circumstantial indicia of reliability justifying the admission of the
    notations under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge told the jury that the notations on Discount
    Sales’ banking documents could be used to connect the appellant to the proceeds
    of the fraud paid through Discount Sales’ bank accounts.  He told the jury to be “cautious” in using
    the notations as evidence against the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the notations were inadmissible
    hearsay and argues that their admission could not possibly have affected the
    outcome.  In light of the Crown’s
    concession, I will assume the notations should not have been admitted as
    evidence capable of connecting the appellant to the proceeds funnelled through
    Discount Sales’ bank accounts.  I agree
    with the Crown’s submission that the admission of the notations for that
    purpose caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart entirely from the appellant’s connection to
    Discount Sales, there was overwhelming evidence of the <span class=GramE>appellant’s
    knowing</span> involvement in the fraudulent scheme.  Mr. Tulloch and Mr. Solty gave direct
    evidence describing the appellant as the prime mover in the scheme, both as it
    related to the arrangement of the fraudulent transactions and the methods used
    to disseminate the proceeds of the scheme to the various participants.  Mr. Tulloch testified that the appellant knew
    that the equipment being “sold” did not exist.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was also evidence, apart from the notations on
    the banking documents, linking the appellant to Discount Sales.  Mr. Tulloch gave evidence that the appellant
    operated Discount Sales and that Discount Sales received payments for setting
    up the fraudulent transactions.  Mr. Tulloch
    also testified that the appellant used Discount Sales to funnel certain
    portions of Mr. Tulloch’s share of the proceeds into purchases of a motorcycle
    and a boat for Mr. Tulloch.  Financial
    records confirmed the use of Discount Sales to make the payment for these
    purchases.  In addition to Mr. Tulloch’s
    evidence, the Articles of Incorporation for Discount Sales showed the
    appellant’s home address as the residential address for the first
    director.  John O’Meara, who was listed
    as the first director, was the appellant’s father-in-law.  According to Mr. O’Meara’s wife, Mr. O’Meara
    had nothing to do with the operation of any business out of either the
    residential or the registered business address shown on the Articles of
    Incorporation.  She also testified that
    her husband had no significant assets when he passed away.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is obvious from a review of the record that the
    notations on the bank documents were but a small brick in a very large wall
    built by the evidence offered by the Crown against the appellant.  Assuming those notations could not be used as
    evidence against the appellant, the rest of the evidence presented an
    overwhelming case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submitted that his rights under s.
    11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> were infringed
    and that the proceedings should have been stayed as a result of the
    unreasonable delay in bringing him to trial on these charges.  The appellant was arrested in August 1999 and
    did not go to trial until November 2004.  A 63-month delay between arrest and trial obviously merits s. 11(b)
    scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This trial was one of three complicated and
    interrelated fraud trials arising out of a lengthy and complex investigation
    involving several different police forces.  The appellant was charged in respect of two of the three allegedly
    fraudulent schemes.  It was acknowledged
    that the trials involving those schemes could not proceed together.  The Crown chose to proceed with what was
    referred to as the “car flip” fraud before proceeding with the charges at issue
    in this appeal, which were referred to as the “heavy equipment” fraud.  Preliminary inquiries were held in respect of
    both the “car flip” and the “heavy equipment” frauds in 2001.  The “car flip” trial was set for November
    2002 as counsel for the appellant was not available on the earlier dates
    offered by the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “car flip” trial proceeded in November 2002.  Evidence continued until June 2003, with
    written submissions completed in November 2003.  The appellant was convicted in March 2004 and sentenced in May
    2004.  On the same date that sentence was
    passed on the “car flip” <span class=GramE>charges, a November 2004 date was</span> set for the trial of the “heavy equipment” charges.  The court offered September dates but counsel
    for the appellant was not available until the end of October 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no merit to the s. 11(b) claim.  In light of the number and complexity of the
    charges, and the reality that the charges had to be prosecuted separately and
    sequentially, it was inevitable that the last trial would take place years
    after the arrest.  There is no basis to
    criticize the Crown for the order in which it chose to prosecute the cases or
    for the manner in which the individual charges made their way through the
    process.  Counsel for the appellant
    agreed to this sequence of trials.  It
    was eminently reasonable to await the end of the “car flip” trial before
    setting a trial date for these charges.  The
    appellant was offered dates within about four months of the conclusion of the
    “car flip” trial.  I see nothing unreasonable
    in a four-month interval between two lengthy and complicated proceedings.</p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>VI</span></b></h1>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant received a sentence of three years.  He was the prime mover in what can only be
    described as a massive fraud against the Government of Canada which caused
    actual losses to Canada exceeding $3 million.  Tax frauds on the public purse undermine the fiscal viability of a
    country and must be treated as serious crimes meriting denunciatory sentences.  Three years is well within the appropriate
    range for this kind of offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant makes one argument against
    the fitness of sentence.  He submits that,
    when the appellant was sentenced, he had a prior fraud conviction arising out
    of the earlier “car flip” trial.  That
    conviction was subsequently overturned in this court and the Crown declined to
    retry the matter.  Counsel submits that
    the appellant, therefore, was in fact a first offender and that his sentence
    should be adjusted in this court to reflect that status.  Counsel for the Crown submits that the prior
    sentence on the “car flip” trial was, through the totality principle,
    effectively treated as a mitigating factor when the trial judge sentenced the
    appellant for the charges at issue.  Without
    addressing the merits of either argument directly, I would simply say that even
    if the appellant is treated as a first offender, three years for this crime is
    entirely appropriate.</p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>VII</span></b></h1>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeals, and affirm the convictions
    and the sentences imposed by the trial judge.  </p>

    propriety of counsel’s comments concerning the appellant’s failure to testify
    is not in issue on this appeal.  Nothing
    in these reasons should be taken as approval of all of the comments made by
    counsel for Mr. Solty.  Some comments,
    especially the comment in the last sentence, may have gone too far.  In any case where counsel proposes to make a
    submission to the jury based on a co-accused’s failure to testify, that
    submission should be vetted with the trial judge before it is made.  The trial judge will consider the proposed
    wording of the submission having regard to the competing interests of the
    co-accused as discussed in<i> Crawford</i>.</p>
