  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that there must be a new trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was acquitted of six or seven charges.  He was convicted on count 2 of the indictment
    which alleged that he paid for sex with a person <span class=GramE>under</span> 18 years of age (the complainant).  We
    note that the indictment contained three other charges alleging similar
    activity with the same complainant. The appellant was acquitted on those three
    charges.  The difference between those
    charges and count 2 was that he admitted the conduct underlying count 2 and
    denied engaging in the conduct underlying the other charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advanced two defences on count 2.  First, he alleged that the money he
    admittedly paid to the complainant and her friend was not paid in consideration
    for the sexual activity but for another reason.  Second, he contended that he believed that the complainant was 18 years
    of age and that he had taken all reasonable steps to ascertain her age as
    required by s. 150.1(5) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge spent considerable time preparing her
    instructions to the jury with the assistance of counsel.  She ultimately prepared decision trees for
    the jury in respect of each count.  We
    were advised at the outset of the argument that the decision trees in the
    appeal book are not the decision trees that were actually given to the jury as
    certain changes were made after comments by counsel.  We were advised of those changes and have <span
class=GramE>proceeded</span> on the basis of the amended decision trees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s general instructions on the
    presumption of innocence and the burden of proof were entirely
    appropriate.  She turned to count 2 in
    her instructions and made the following statement to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Leon Wasser must take all reasonable steps to
    ascertain that D.B. was not under eighteen.  Based on the objective and subjective
    evidence, has the Crown proven that he failed to take all of these legal steps?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Looking, then, at box four, if you are satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that he took all reasonable steps to ascertain that
    she was not under the age of eighteen years, you follow the area to the right
    and enter a final verdict of “not guilty” and your deliberations on that count
    are over.  If you are not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Leon Wasser took all reasonable steps to
    ascertain that Denisha Brown was not under the age of eighteen years, you take
    the arrow to the bottom and you enter a final verdict of “guilty”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the first sentence in the above-quoted
    extract is somewhat misleading with respect to the onus of proof.  The second sentence correctly states the onus
    of proof.  Unfortunately, the next
    paragraph contains a twice repeated serious misstatement of the burden of
    proof.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made subsequent references to the
    burden of proof as it related to the question of reasonable steps to determine
    the complainant’s age in count 2.  Two
    references to the burden of proof were accurate in that they indicated that the
    Crown was required to prove that the appellant did not take all reasonable
    steps.  A third reference, while somewhat
    unclear, was also accurate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that the trial judge, in giving the above-quoted
    instruction to the jury, which was clearly in error, specifically directed the
    jury to the language of question 4 of the decision tree:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Did Leon Wasser take all reasonable steps to
    ascertain that [the complainant] was not under the age of eighteen years?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without explanation that language, which is taken from
    the relevant <i>Criminal Code</i> section,
    suggests that there was an onus on the appellant to take steps to determine the
    complainant’s actual age.  Given that implication
    in the language, it was especially important that the trial judge make it clear
    that the Crown carried the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant did not take all reasonable steps.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury was given conflicting and confusing
    instructions on the burden of proof as it related to the question of reasonable
    steps to determine the complainant’s age.  In our view, having regard to the totality of the instructions, there is
    a reasonable possibility that the jury may have been misled by the different
    instructions, or at least left in a state of uncertainty as to the law to be
    applied by the jury on this issue:  see <i>R. v. Brydon</i> (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d)
    481.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent points out that there was no
    objection taken.  He properly emphasizes
    the absence of any objection given the exhaustive manner in which the jury
    instructions were vetted with counsel.  In our view, however, the absence of any objection has little significance
    in the face of what was an unequivocal error by the trial judge in her
    description of the burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two further points to be made about the trial
    judge’s instructions.  First, the trial
    judge did not address the question of the appellant’s subjective belief as to
    the complainant’s age as a distinct issue.  Nor did she refer to the evidence relevant to that issue.  Instead, she proceeded directly to the
    question of the appellant’s reasonable belief with respect to the complainant’s
    age and the evidence relevant to that issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would have been better for the trial judge to treat
    the two issues separately and to first instruct the jury that it was the
    appellant’s position that he honestly believed that the complainant was 18
    years of age.  The trial judge should
    then have reviewed the evidence pro and con to that position before turning to
    the question of the reasonableness of that belief and the evidence pertinent to
    it.  As a matter of logic, the issues
    should be approached in that way, although we accept that there is merit to the
    Crown’s contention that the manner in which they were approached may have enured
    to the appellant’s benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not
    make it as clear as she could have that the Crown was required to prove that
    the appellant knew at the time he gave the complainant and her friend the money,
    that the money was being given in exchange for sexual services.  While parts of the instruction make that
    requirement implicit, its centrality to the appellant’s defence on count 2 dictated
    that the trial judge should have expressly instructed the jury on the knowledge
    requirement as it relates to this element of the offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed and the conviction on count 2 is
    quashed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given our disposition of the issue, we are satisfied
    that it is unnecessary to address the constitutional issue.  We note that the issue was not raised at
    trial and we think it would better to await a case where the issue has been
    properly vetted at trial before it is considered in this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant asks that this court enter a
    stay or an acquittal.  He observes that
    the sentence has been served and that the verdict will create logistical
    problems if there is a re-trial on count 2 only.  We see no reason to depart from the usual
    order.  The conviction is quashed and a
    new trial is ordered.  It will be for the
    Crown to decide whether to proceed with that trial.</p>
