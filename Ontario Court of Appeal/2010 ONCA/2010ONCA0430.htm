  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Introduction</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal from the judgment of Abbey J.
    dismissing their action for medical malpractice arising from the death of Roy
    Dufresne. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Dufresne died from a massive pulmonary embolism
    that arose as a complication of arthroscopic knee surgery performed by the
    respondent, Dr.&nbsp;Bartol, an orthopaedic surgeon. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pulmonary embolism is a potentially fatal condition
    that <span lang=EN-US>occurs when a blood clot</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>migrates to
    the lungs. Deep vein thrombosis (“DVT”) is a related condition involving blood
    clots in the veins of the leg. </span>Venous thromboembolism (“VTE”) refers to
    clots in blood vessels generally, including those to deep veins in the legs and
    pulmonary embolisms</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, it is undisputed that, following his
    release from hospital and two days prior to his death, Mr. Dufresne suffered at
    least one of the recognized symptoms of pulmonary embolism and that his
    condition on that day was treatable. However, he had not been told about the
    symptoms of pulmonary embolism and he did not realize that he should seek
    medical treatment immediately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellants argued that the respondent was
    negligent in failing to investigate and treat Mr. Dufresne for DVT or pulmonary
    embolism while he was in hospital, and, at the very least, in failing to warn Mr.
    Dufresne about the symptoms of pulmonary embolism when he discharged him from
    the hospital on February 26, 2001. The appellants relied, in part, on Mr.
    Dufresne's reluctance to move following surgery and on undisputed evidence that
    immobility creates a heightened risk of pulmonary embolism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the respondent's assessment
    that there was no clinical evidence of a blood clot while Mr. Dufresne was in
    the hospital was consistent with the weight of the expert medical evidence
    presented at trial. The trial judge also accepted the respondent's evidence
    that Mr. Dufresne met his physiotherapy goals while in hospital and that he was
    not immobile on the date of discharge. He therefore rejected the appellants’
    claim that the respondent was negligent in failing to investigate and treat
    Mr.&nbsp;Dufresne for DVT or pulmonary embolism while Mr. Dufresne was in the
    hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the respondent acknowledged that immobility
    for a period of days following discharge from the hospital would create a
    heightened risk of pulmonary embolism, the trial judge accepted the
    respondent's evidence that, from a medical perspective, he did not consider Mr.
    Dufresne at any greater risk of VTE than any other similar patient. The trial
    judge held that the respondent properly addressed the risk of immobility
    following discharge by emphasizing the importance of mobility and providing Mr.
    Dufresne with a prescription for physiotherapy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellants do not challenge the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the respondent was not negligent in his treatment of
    Mr. Dufresne in the hospital. The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial
    judge erred in failing to find the respondent negligent because he did not warn
    Mr. Dufresne about the symptoms of pulmonary embolism when he discharged him
    from the hospital on February 26, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants claim that the respondent’s own evidence
    discloses that he believed that Mr. Dufresne was at heightened risk for
    developing pulmonary embolism when he discharged him from the hospital. The
    appellants contend the trial judge erred by focussing improperly on the
    respondent’s evidence concerning Mr. Dufresne’s condition while he was in the
    hospital and by failing to take account of the respondent’s evidence relating
    to what could happen in the future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely, in particular, on the respondent's
    evidence that he warned Mr.&nbsp;Dufresne that he could die from a blood clot
    if he did not keep moving after being discharged from the hospital. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Respondent's Evidence Concerning his Caution to Mr.
    Dufresne on Discharge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the respondent testified that although Mr.
    Dufresne had done what he was supposed to do in terms of moving around while in
    the hospital, “he... really needed a push from the nurses” in order to do so.
    The respondent was therefore concerned that Mr.&nbsp;Dufresne might need
    additional persuasion at home to avoid becoming immobile. Because mobility is
    essential to a good surgical outcome and because immobility creates a
    heightened risk of DVT, the respondent “tried to scare [Mr. Dufresne] into
    getting mobile.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent said that he behaved as if he was angry
    and yelled at Mr.&nbsp;Dufresne. He told Mr. Dufresne “he was at risk of
    developing a blood clot and blood clots can kill you.” He also gave Mr.
    Dufresne a second prescription for physiotherapy because Mr. Dufresne had
    misplaced the original prescription the respondent had provided previously. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, the respondent acknowledged that
    he was concerned that if Mr. Dufresne continued the pattern of behaviour he
    demonstrated while in the hospital, he could be on the road to a fatal blood
    clot: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. You had concerns that if he continues on this
    pattern, he was at risk of suffering from a fatal blood clot?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes. My concern is
    that he was in hospital and he had somebody there. He had several people there,
    nurses and therapists who were following protocols and procedures to get him
    moving and he didn't want to move and he made it pretty clear to them that he
    didn't want to move, but he did what they told him he had to do and so he was
    moving appropriately and that makes his risk on the 26th no different from his
    pre-op risk, which is pretty minimal. <i>But
    my concern was that having heard that he doesn't want to get up and move, he
    might go home and lie in the basement and not do anything and stay immobile for
    three days and I know that if a patient is immobile following surgery for
    several days at a time, they do have an increased risk of blood clots and blood
    clots can be fatal.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. What I'm suggesting to you and you can
    correct me if I'm wrong, that's what you were really concerned about was him
    continuing down the path he was going and having a fatal blood clot?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. My concern was his continuing down the path he
    was going and having a blood clot and the effect that that would have on his
    outcome, yes. With that, there is a concern that he could be on the path to a
    fatal blood clot if he goes home and reverts to an old pattern of behaviour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also rely on the portions of the
    respondent’s evidence set out in Appendix ‘A’, which they say make it clear
    that he believed that Mr. Dufresne was at a heightened risk for a pulmonary
    embolism on February 26, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her evidence at trial, Mrs. Dufresne disputed the
    respondent's claim that he warned Mr. Dufresne he could die from a blood clot
    if he did not keep moving after being discharged from the hospital.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not make a finding concerning
    whether the respondent cautioned Mr. Dufresne in the manner he described.
    Instead, the trial judge found that on February 26, the respondent did not
    consider Mr.&nbsp;Dufresne to be at any greater risk of pulmonary embolism from
    a medical point of view than any other patient who had undergone the same
    procedure. As the risk of pulmonary embolism to such a patient was infinitesimally
    small, the respondent was under no duty to warn Mr. Dufresne of the symptoms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, although the respondent considered Mr.
    Dufresne at risk of becoming immobile following discharge, and recognized that
    immobility would in turn create a heightened risk of pulmonary embolism, the trial
    judge concluded that the respondent properly addressed the risk of immobility by
    cautioning Mr. Dufresne to stay mobile and giving him a second prescription for
    physiotherapy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although somewhat lengthy, the trial judge’s reasons
    relating to these issues are central to this appeal and I set them out in full
    below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It is
    apparent from the overall testimony of the defendant that, from a medical point
    of view, he did not consider that Roy was at any greater risk regarding VTE
    than any other patient who had undergone ACL reconstructive surgery</i> and
    that he considered the risk of a pulmonary embolism following such surgery as
    infinitesimally small. He had never heard or read, he said, of the development
    of a pulmonary embolism following arthroscopic surgery.&nbsp; As I said, he
    found no clinical evidence of a blood clot and he considered Roy’s condition to
    be as would be expected.&nbsp; All the physiotherapy goals had been met. The
    defendant recorded in his discharge summary that Roy was mobilizing well.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant's assessment that there was no
    clinical evidence of a blood clot and that Roy was at no greater risk than any
    other patient who had undergone ACL reconstructive surgery, is consistent with
    the weight of the expert medical evidence in this case. His assessment
    concerning the rarity of a pulmonary embolism following ACL reconstructive
    surgery is consistent with the statistical evidence in this case. <i>His conclusion that immobility for a period
    of days following discharge would heighten the risk of a pulmonary embolism is
    also consistent with the medical evidence</i>. The patient, however, was not immobile
    on February 26.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The issue
    which directly confronted the defendant was how to deal with the risk of
    immobility and he addressed that concern</i>. He emphasized the importance of
    mobility. He provided a script for physiotherapy and told Roy that he was to
    begin immediately.&nbsp; Physiotherapy, as the defendant explained in his
    testimony, while not a treatment for blood clots, does address mobility, not
    only directly, but also because, as he explained, physiotherapists are the eyes
    and ears of the doctor after discharge. They provide a means of monitoring the
    condition of the patient including the patient's level of mobility.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The statement
    that Roy could die from a pulmonary embolism, if the defendant made it, was not
    prompted by a belief that Roy was, from a medical point of view, at heightened
    risk</i>. To the contrary, the defendant found no clinical evidence of a blood
    clot and considered that Roy was in no different situation than any other
    patient who had experienced ACL arthroscopic surgery and therefore at extremely
    low risk of a pulmonary embolism.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>As the
    defendant explained in his testimony, he did not list the warning signs of a
    pulmonary embolism because there was nothing in Roy's condition to suggest that
    he represented anything but a routine case</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added].</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge misapprehended Dr. Bartol’s
    evidence when he concluded that Dr. Bartol did not perceive a heightened risk
    of pulmonary embolism when he discharged Mr. Dufresne from the hospital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Mr. Dufresne had no clinical symptoms of a
    blood clot when he was discharged from the hospital, Dr. Bartol acknowledged in
    his evidence that he believed there was a realistic prospect that Mr. Dufresne
    would become immobile once at home. Significantly, according to his own
    evidence, Dr. Bartol recognized that immobility, in turn, created a heightened
    risk of pulmonary embolism. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether he cautioned Mr. Dufresne in the manner he
    described or not, based on his own evidence, Dr. Bartol recognized a need to
    caution Mr. Dufresne to stay mobile in the strongest of terms because of Mr.
    Dufresne’s behaviour in the hospital and because Mr. Dufresne would not have
    the assistance of the nursing staff to encourage him to move once at home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a common sense reading of Dr. Bartol's
    evidence can yield no conclusion other than that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Bartol</span> perceived a heightened risk of Mr. Dufresne developing a pulmonary embolism
    when he discharged him from the hospital. The fact that the risk arose from Mr.
    Dufresne's behaviour rather than from a specific medical condition does not
    change the conclusion that Dr. Bartol recognized Mr. Dufresne was at a
    heightened risk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the respondent’s own experts acknowledged that
    there would be a duty to warn a patient of the symptoms of pulmonary embolism
    if there was a heightened risk of that condition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, I conclude that the trial judge
    made a palpable and overriding error in finding that the respondent did not
    perceive a heightened risk of pulmonary embolism when he discharged Mr.
    Dufresne from the hospital and in failing to find that the respondent had a
    duty to warn Mr. Dufresne of the symptoms of pulmonary embolism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants acknowledged in oral argument that, if
    successful on appeal, there must be a new trial because the trial judge did not
    deal with certain issues, for example, the question of contributory negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would allow the appeal and order a new

  <p class=headingNUMBER>                        <u>In-Chief</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Now what impression did you get from consulting
    with the nurses about Roy Dufresne on Monday morning?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. My impression was that he had done what he was
    supposed to do in terms of getting up and moving and ambulating, but they gave
    me the impression that he had needed a bit of a push or a lot of encouragement
    to do it. They gave me the impression that he was not the type to get up and
    get going by <span class=GramE>himself</span>. He had really needed a push from
    the nurses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Did that cause you any concern?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. It did.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Why was that a concern?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Well it's a concern for two reasons. First of
    all, it's a concern because mobilization and rehabilitation are critical to a
    good outcome following this type of surgery. The second reason is that
    mobilization is critical to the general well being including improving
    circulation, reducing complications such as blood clots.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Well we've heard from a lot of doctors over the
    last few days about the mobility issue relative to blood clots. Is that
    something you were aware of?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Is that something you were concerned about?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Q. Did you
    have any concerns if he - that he might become immobile when he went home
    without anyone to push him?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>A. Yes. My
    concern was that if he had needed persuasion in the hospital he might need
    additional persuasion at home as well.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<i> And what
    would the risks be if he didn't get mobile at home? </i>If he sat in bed all
    day or <span class=GramE>laid</span> in the bed all day?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Well the biggest risk is that he's going to get
    a failure of his operative outcome because lazing around not moving and not
    mobilizing appropriately greatly increases the risk of having a bad outcome
    from the surgical procedure. So that's my main concern. <i>The second concern of course is that as with any surgical patient,
    there is a risk of venous stasis and blood clots and....</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. So what did you tell him?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. So I tried to scare him into getting mobile and
    I told him that he had to get mobile and if he didn't get mobile, he was at
    risk of developing a blood clot and blood clots can kill you and I was quite
    deliberate in telling him that because I was very concerned about the surgical
    outcome and I wanted to ensure that he had the best possible chance of a good
    recovery.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. What type of demeanour were you expressing
    towards Roy Dufresne at that time?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I was angry. I should say I behaved angry. I
    believe that I probably yelled at him. I raised my voice and I let him know
    that I was upset that he was giving indications that he may not follow
    appropriate rehabilitation guidelines and mobilize the way that we had agreed
    prior to the surgery.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. You gave him a script for physiotherapy?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes he had - he indicated he didn't have the
    script that had previously been provided. So I cut another script and gave him
    another script for physical therapy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>In Cross-examination</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. <i>I'm
    going to suggest you doctor</i> and I want you to listen closely, that after
    you talked to the nurses and learned of their concerns with respect to his
    weekend mobility and non-compliance, combined with the fact that this surgery
    had VTE risks in and of itself, <i>that you
    had heightened concerns that this man was prone to a fatal blood clot if he
    continued that behaviour?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>If he
    continued that behaviour after discharge, yes.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. <i>You had
    concerns that if he continues on this pattern, he was at risk of suffering from
    a fatal blood clot?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes. My concern is that he was in hospital and
    he had somebody there. He had several people there, nurses and therapists who
    were following protocols and procedures to get him moving and he didn't want to
    move and he made it pretty clear to them that he didn't want to move, but he
    did what they told him he had to do and so he was moving appropriately and that
    makes his risk on the 26th no different from his pre-op risk, which is pretty
    minimal. <i>But my concern was that having
    heard that he doesn't want to get up and move, he might go home and lie in the
    basement and not do anything and stay immobile for three days and I know that
    if a patient is immobile following surgery for several days at a time, they do
    have an increased risk of blood clots and blood clots can be fatal.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. <i>What
    I'm suggesting to you</i> and you can correct me if I'm wrong, <i>that's what you were really concerned about
    was him continuing down the path he was going and having a fatal blood clot?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>My concern
    was his continuing down the path he was going and having a blood clot and the
    effect that that would have on his outcome, yes. With that, there is a concern
    that he could be on the path to a fatal blood clot if he goes home and reverts
    to an old pattern of behaviour</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. You felt compelled to do something about this
    potentially catastrophic situation and what you did is you went into his room
    and you told him that he needed to get mobile and that if he laid around he was
    going to get sick because blood clots are serious. They'll kill him, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. And you didn't say to him, if you lay around
    here, this operation’s going to be a failure, did you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No because I had made that perfectly clear prior
    to the surgery and it didn't have the impact that I wanted it to have.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I felt that he needed a little stronger
    motivation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. And the stronger motivation being scaring him
    that he might die?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Well and I told you that in discovery that I was
    concerned I may have over-scared him by saying that he might die, but yes
    that's what I did.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. Surely Doctor, you would agree with me
    that you wouldn't ordinarily say that to a patient unless you had heightened
    concern that it might be true?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. There is - there is some truth to it. There is
    risk that you can get a blood clot and you can die from the blood clot, but
    what I knew then and what I know now, even more than I knew then, is that the
    risk of death from a blood clot after this operation is exceedingly small,
    infinitesimally small.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. That's not the question I asked you.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.  But the
    risk of failure is very high.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. That's not the question I asked you. I asked you
    this. You turned your mind to this warning. You went in there and you gave him
    this warning and you intended to and did scare him for the purpose of alerting
    him to the fact that you believed he was headed down a road to a possible fatal
    pulmonary embolism, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. I'm not sure I really did scare him, but that
    was my intent, yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. That was your intention <i>and your intention was because of your heightened concerns about him
    having a fatal pulmonary embolism</i>, correct if he continued down that road?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>If he went
    back to his previous behaviour, yes.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. <i>Well then
    why the warning?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Because he wasn't mobilizing his knee. He wasn't
    getting up and I was afraid that he would (1) ruin the outcomes of a good
    operation and (2) <i>he did have a risk of going
    home and <span class=GramE>laying</span> around and not moving because no one
    was telling him to move. So I made it clear, he had to move and I wanted to
    make sure that he understood how imperative it was</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. <i>So you did
    believe that he was at risk of pulmonary embolism if he continued down that
    road?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A<i>. If he went down that road, yes and that's what I told him.</i> </p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of
    Simmons J.A. I do not agree that the trial judge (a) misapprehended Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Bartol’s</span> evidence, (b) made any error regarding Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Bartol’s</span> assessment of heightened risk of pulmonary
    embolism at the time of Mr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Dufresne’s</span> discharge, or (c) misapplied the standard of care. I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial judge
    made a palpable and overriding error in failing to find that, when he
    discharged Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> from hospital on February 26,
    2001, the respondent believed that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> was
    at a heightened risk for a pulmonary embolism that required a warning regarding
    the symptoms of that condition and an instruction to return to hospital if any
    of those symptoms occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the trial judge made a
    palpable and overriding error in failing to give effect to the respondent’s own
    evidence that he believed that Mr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> was
    at a heightened risk of developing a pulmonary embolism. They contend that the
    trial judge erred by focussing on the respondent’s evidence concerning
    Mr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Dufresne’s</span> condition on February 26, 2001,
    and by failing to take account of the respondent’s evidence relating to what
    could happen in the future, which they say amounted to a statement of his
    belief that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> was at a heightened risk of
    developing a pulmonary embolism. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellants have asked this court to
    reassess the evidence of Dr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Bartol</span>, including
    his credibility, and to substitute their interpretation of his evidence for
    that of the trial judge. As numerous decisions on the standard of review on
    appeal have stated, that is not the role of this court. At best, even if the
    reading contended for by the appellants is one available reading, it was open
    to the trial judge to accept Dr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Bartol’s</span> meaning
    as he did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing with the risk factors for venous <span
class=SpellE>thromboembolism</span> (“VTE”), which includes pulmonary embolism,
    the trial judge identified surgery and immobility as the relevant factors in
    this case. On the specific issue of risk of immobility when Mr.&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> went home from hospital following the surgery, the
    trial judge referred to the evidence of each of the expert witnesses as well as
    to the published guidelines from 2001 and 2004 and the British Orthopaedic
    Association Best Practice Guidelines. He stated his conclusion based on all the
    evidence at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 75 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my judgment, the medical evidence as a whole in
    this case clearly supports the conclusion that, as the situation was on the
    morning of February 26, 2001, with the exception of the extremely low risk
    associated with routine arthroscopic ACL surgery, none of the other factors
    which would have indicated a heightened risk of VTE, on the application of any
    guideline existing at the time, were present. The symptoms which had been
    evident over the weekend were no longer, and Roy, by then, presented as a
    patient with a low risk of VTE referable only to the surgery itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion was largely premised on the trial
    judge’s finding, accepted on this appeal, that, following surgery, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> was adequately mobile. Despite his resistance to
    mobilizing, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> was not actually immobile
    while in hospital, and therefore not at a risk of blood clotting any greater
    than other surgery patients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then referred to the expert evidence on
    the standard of care. Dr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Orsini</span> for the
    plaintiff testified that his own standard was higher than the accepted standard.
    His opinion that the respondent fell below the standard was influenced by his
    reading of the respondent’s discovery evidence that the respondent believed on
    discharge that the patient “was on a path to a fatal blood clot.” The opinions
    of Doctors Johnson and Fowler, which were based on an analysis of the available
    records, <span class=GramE>was</span> that “there was no need to investigate or
    treat for VTE and no need to warn of the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge next turned to the issue of what the
    respondent himself actually believed was the situation at the time he
    discharged Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> home. In that regard the
    trial judge recorded that each of the specialists who testified had
    acknowledged the unique position of the treating orthopaedic surgeon and of that
    surgeon’s belief as to whether the patient was at heightened risk for pulmonary
    embolism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After quoting in detail substantially all of the
    evidence quoted by Simmons J.A., the trial judge set out his analysis and
    conclusion on this critical issue in <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 105 to
    109 of his reasons. These paragraphs have already been quoted by
    Simmons&nbsp;J.A. in her reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his Conclusion, the trial judge specifically
    addressed Dr. <span class=SpellE>Orsini’s</span> view that the respondent
    believed the patient had a heightened risk of immobility and disagreed. He
    stated at <span class=SpellE>para</span> 122: “For the reasons that I have
    expressed, I do not believe that the defendant considered that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Roy represented a greater risk than that applicable to
    any patient following ACL arthroscopic surgery. Rather, he assessed that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Roy required some encouragement in regard to mobility in
    order to ensure that he would not be at increased risk.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge stated his analysis of what
    the respondent understood and what he did, and also referred to what might be a
    higher and better standard of care. He states his conclusion on these two
    points at <span class=SpellE>paras</span> 124 and 125:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>After examining Roy and after understanding his
    level of [his] mobility from the nurses and the physiotherapist, the defendant
    saw nothing to suggest the presence of a blood clot or a risk of a pulmonary
    embolism beyond the extremely minimal risk which is the case in every ACL
    reconstructive surgery. He felt it prudent to say something about continued
    mobility. He did that and again emphasized the need for immediate
    physiotherapy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Applying a standard of perfection in perfect
    hindsight, it certainly would have been preferable had the defendant gone on to
    make reference to the warning signs of a pulmonary embolism. I do not believe,
    however, that, in the circumstances which existed on February 26, the failure
    of the defendant to have outlined the warning signs of or to have investigated
    or treated for DVT represents conduct below the applicable professional
    standard. Rather, in my opinion, the defendant exercised that degree of skill,
    care and judgment as could reasonably be expected of a normal, prudent
    orthopaedic specialist at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One could debate whether the standard of care should
    require that all post-operative patients be told the symptoms of pulmonary embolism
    to meet the possibility that anyone could suffer that consequence, in given
    circumstances. However, it was not the evidence that that was the standard of
    care in this case or that it should be.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the appellant’s suggestion for the standard
    of care appears to be that on discharge of a patient the treating surgeon is
    obliged to assess whether it is so likely that the patient will ignore the
    surgeon’s instructions to be mobile and to exercise, that a symptoms warning
    for pulmonary embolism is required. Even if that were the test, it is clear
    that the trial judge effectively concluded that the respondent was satisfied
    that the stern warning he gave Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dufresne</span> about the
    imperative to be mobile and to exercise was sufficient to remove any heightened
    risk of future immobility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge conducted a thorough and
    thoughtful analysis of the issues in the context of the entire record. His
    reasons are careful and clear. His conclusions are reasonable ones based on the
    record. It cannot be said that he misapprehended the issues or the evidence. He
    clearly expressed his understanding of the evidence on the key point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no basis to interfere with his conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal with costs, if demanded, to
    the respondent on the partial indemnity scale, fixed at $10,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
