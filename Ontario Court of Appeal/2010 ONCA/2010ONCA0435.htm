          from acquittal by Justice Melvyn Green of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was acquitted on charges of operating a motor vehicle
    while impaired by alcohol and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol
    content exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol per one hundred millilitres of
    blood, contrary to s.&nbsp;253(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46.  The Crown successfully appealed to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court,
    which ordered a new trial.  The appellant now seeks leave to appeal to this
    court and, if leave be granted, seeks an order restoring her acquittal.  This
    appeal raises the issue of the propriety of judges editing the transcripts of
    oral reasons for judgement after they are delivered, as well as the legal
    requirements for a demand for a breath sample under s. 254(3) of the <i>Code</i>.
     For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Facts</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was stopped by police while driving north on the Don
    Valley Parkway in Toronto.  After a short exchange with a police officer she
    was arrested and charged with impaired driving.  The appellant was then read a
    breath demand, taken to the police station and, on providing breath samples
    that were over the legal limit, was also charged as well with driving with more
    than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant brought a <i>Charter </i>application to exclude
    the evidence of the breathalyser readings.  The appellant alleged that the
    officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand.  In view
    of this, she submitted that the samples were obtained in a manner that violated
    her s. 8 <i>Charter </i>rights, and that the readings should be excluded under s.
    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge determined that although the officer had the subjective
    belief needed to make the demand, his belief was not supported objectively on
    the facts.  Hence, the trial judge found that the samples were obtained in a
    manner that violated the appellant’s s. 8 rights.  He then determined that in
    all of the circumstances, the breathalyser readings should be excluded from the
    evidence.  This in turn led to the dismissal of both charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed to the summary conviction appeal court.  The summary
    conviction appeal judge determined that the trial judge applied the wrong principles
    in finding a s. 8 <i>Charter</i> violation and she ordered a new trial.  The
    appellant now seeks leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction
    appeal judge and, if leave is granted, appeals the decision itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advances two grounds of appeal.  First, he argues that the
    summary conviction appeal judge gave insufficient reasons for judgment and
    erred in altering the transcript of her oral reasons after they were delivered. 
    The alterations, she submits, include making deletions and additions to the
    transcript on matters of substance.  Second, the appellant argues that the
    trial judge did not err in his legal analysis of what constitutes reasonable
    and probable grounds and that the summary conviction appeal judge erred in concluding
    otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that leave to appeal ought to be granted as the
    issue of altering the transcript of reasons for judgment is a legal issue of
    significance to the general administration of criminal justice.  She further
    contends that the merits of her appeal are strong and that this court should
    restore her acquittals.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The summary conviction appeal judge’s reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The </span>summary conviction appeal was heard
    on July 3, 2008 and the judge delivered oral reasons in court that same day. 
    When the transcript of the oral reasons was released sometime later, counsel
    noted that the transcript, although certified as being accurate by the court
    reporter, contained substantial changes from the reasons delivered in open
    court.  Counsel for the appellant, with the consent of the Crown, asked for and
    obtained a copy of the recording of the proceedings in court on the day judgment
    was delivered and had a fresh transcript prepared.  A comparison between the
    two texts showed that there had been deletions and additions to the reasons
    delivered in court.  While the changes did not modify the decision nor the
    basis for the decision, they expanded to a significant degree on the reasoning
    used by the summary conviction appeal judge to reach her decision.  As will be
    seen, the changes have no impact on the outcome of the present appeal. 
    However, because concerns regarding the editing of transcripts have, to varying
    degrees, been raised by either or both parties in several appeals to this
    court, additional comment and analysis of the issue is warranted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it is inappropriate to modify,
    change or add to a transcript of oral reasons rendered in court.  There may
    well be circumstances, such as when the original transcription is no longer
    available, where the improper alteration of the transcript would be sufficient
    to warrant ordering a new trial.  That said, editing the transcript for
    readability and to assist in catching errors by the transcriber – not the judge
    – is appropriate.  This would normally be limited to matters such as punctuation,
    grammatical errors and the like.  It is not an opportunity to revise, correct
    or reconsider the words actually spoken and no changes of substance are to be made. 
    It must be recalled that the transcription of oral reasons rendered in court is
    exactly that, a transcript of what occurred in court.  The reporter preparing
    the transcript is called upon to certify that the transcript is “a true and
    accurate transcription of my recordings, to the best of my skill and ability.” 
    To seek to alter the transcript places the reporter in the invidious position
    of either refusing to certify the transcription or making a certification that he
    or she does not feel is true and accurate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The integrity of the trial record and of in court
    proceedings is fundamental to the judicial system and to the transparency of
    those proceedings.  Counsel who are present when oral reasons are delivered in
    court should have confidence that the decisions they make with their client
    based on these oral reasons will not be undermined by alterations that
    represent something substantially different from what in fact occurred in the
    courtroom.  Nor should counsel, upon receiving a transcript of the oral
    reasons, be left to wonder whether it in fact reflects what was said in the
    court, or rather constitutes a version of the reasons as later modified by the
    judge.  It is even a greater concern when the alterations to the transcript of
    the reasons are made after a notice of appeal has been filed: see <i>R. v. Geesic</i>,
    2010 ONCA 365.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As stated by Dickson J. in <i>Baxter Travenol
    Laboratories v. Cutter (Canada)</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 388 at 398: “Reasons for
    judgment are not meant to be tentative.”  When parties to a proceeding receive
    reasons that on their face are final, they ought to be entitled to rely on this
    apparent finality.  The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Teskey</i>, [2007]
    2 S.C.R. 267 recognized, however, that in some circumstances there may be good
    reason for announcing a decision prior to delivering the full reasons that led
    to it.  There may be urgency in the outcome being known or, as frequently
    occurs in the case of rulings in the course of a trial, the judge does not want
    to delay the progress of the trial so will indicate the result arrived at with
    or without brief oral reasons.  Similarly, a summary conviction appeal judge
    might choose to announce the decision and outline the reasons for the decision
    in the presence of the parties.  In such cases the judge should give a clear
    indication that the transcription of the decision (and any brief oral reasons
    that may have been given) will be supplemented by more comprehensive reasons,
    written or oral, to follow.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If unforeseen circumstances arise such that,
    after delivery of reasons that were meant to be final, a trial judge wishes to correct
    or supplement the reasons that were already delivered, various options are
    available.  These include the issuance of an addendum, providing supplementary
    reasons or, when the original reasons were oral, subsequently issuing a set of amended
    reasons, written or oral.  Candour and transparency are however, essential. 
    Where changes or additions are made to the reasons, counsel as well as any
    reviewing court should have a clear record of what occurred and be in a
    position to opine as to the legal effect, if any, of the changes or additions
    made by the judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In fairness to the summary conviction appeal
    judge in the present case, the additions and changes made to the reasons simply
    elaborated on the reasons delivered orally.  In my view, the fact that changes
    were made to the transcript rather than through the issuance of supplementary
    reasons has no impact on the outcome of the present appeal.  Regardless of
    which set of reasons this court were to review, the outcome would be the same.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the
    summary conviction appeal judge and the trial judge apply the correct legal
    analysis of reasonable and probable grounds?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for deciding whether there are reasonable and probable grounds
    includes both a subjective and an objective component: (i) the officer must
    have an honest belief that the suspect committed an offence under s. 253 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and (ii) there must be reasonable grounds for this
    belief: <i>R. v. Bernshaw</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254 at para.&nbsp;48.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the central issue before the summary conviction
    appeal judge was whether the trial judge had properly applied the law in
    assessing whether there was a sufficient objective basis for the officer’s
    subjective belief that he had reasonable and probable grounds to demand breath
    samples from the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the trial and summary conviction appeal proceedings, the Supreme
    Court of Canada, in <i>R. v. Shepherd</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, has provided
    useful guidance on the nature of the test and the test itself in cases where a
    court is called upon to decide whether a police officer had reasonable and
    probable grounds to believe that a motorist has committed an offence under s.
    253 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, <i>Shepherd</i> explains that where a court is satisfied that
    the officer had the requisite subjective belief, the sole remaining issue is
    whether that belief was reasonable in the circumstances.  The test is not an
    overly onerous one.  A <i>prima facie</i> case need not be established. 
    Rather, when impaired driving is an issue, what is required is simply that the
    facts as found by the trial judge be sufficient objectively to support the
    officer’s subjective belief that the motorist was driving while his or her
    ability to do so was impaired, even to a slight degree, by alcohol:  see <i>R.
    v. Stellato</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 90 (C.A.), aff’d [1994] 2 S.C.R. 478.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <i>Shepherd</i> makes clear, where appellate courts are called upon
    to review the trial judge’s conclusion on the issue whether the officer had
    reasonable and probable grounds, the appellate court must show deference to the
    trial judge’s findings of fact, but the trial judge’s ultimate ruling is a
    question of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, no issue is taken with the fact that the officer
    had the requisite subjective belief.  Moreover, there is no controversy about
    the facts on which he based his belief.  The sole issue is whether his
    subjective belief was objectively reasonable in the circumstances.  Neither
    court below had the benefit of <i>Shepherd</i>.  Applying that standard and
    having regard to the undisputed facts, set out below, I am of the view that the
    trial judge erred in concluding that the officer’s subjective belief was not
    reasonable in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts, supporting a finding that the officer’s subjective belief was
    reasonable in the circumstances were as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            the appellant was driving at widely varying speeds below the
      speed limit as slow as 60 kilometres and as fast as 80 kilometres in a 90
      kilometres an hour zone;</p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            the appellant was driving in the middle lane of the three north
      bound lanes of the Don Valley Parkway and cars were passing her on both sides; </p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      the appellant was
      repeatedly swerving within and between the lanes;</p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            the appellant continued to drive for a significant distance
      while being signalled to pull over by police in a marked cruiser, first by
      flashing lights, then use of an electric air horn, and eventually by use of the
      car’s siren;</p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            when she was eventually stopped, the appellant stopped in a
      live lane of traffic rather than on an available, albeit narrow, shoulder;</p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            there was an obvious odour of alcoholic beverage coming from
      the appellant’s breath; </p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="line-height:150%">(7)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      the appellant’s face
      was flushed; and</p>
    <p class="ParaNO" style="
line-height:150%">(8)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> when initially questioned by the officer, the appellant admitted to having
      consumed one alcoholic beverage.  When the officer expressed disbelief, she
      changed her answer acknowledging that she may have had two.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these facts are sufficient, at law, to objectively support
    the officer’s subjective belief that the appellant was driving while impaired
    by alcohol.  The fact that some of the traditional indicators of impairment,
    such as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, were not present does not render the
    officer’s subjective belief, based on the signs he did observe, objectively
    unreasonable.  As a result, I would find that the officer had reasonable and
    probable grounds to make the arrest and make the breath demand and that the
    appellant’s <i>Charter </i>claim must therefore fail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of this conclusion, I need not address the s. 24(2) issue.  Similarly,
    it is not necessary to consider the adequacy of the reasons given by the
    summary conviction appeal judge.  In the result, for reasons that differ from
    those of the summary conviction appeal judge, I would grant leave to appeal but
