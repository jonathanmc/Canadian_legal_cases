  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            The appellant’s
    claim for damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident was
    dismissed on summary judgment on the basis that the action was commenced
    outside the limitation period. The issues on appeal are whether the motion
    judge erred by failing to consider the $15,000 statutory deductible from
    general damages as a factor in the discoverability of the claim, and whether he
    erred in the application of the onus of proof on the summary judgment motion. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the front seat passenger in a car
    that was in a low-speed collision on May 24, 2000. She experienced immediate
    pain from the base of her skull to her left shoulder-blade, which continued up
    to the time of the motion. She consulted her family doctor and over the years
    following the accident underwent various therapies including physiotherapy,
    massage therapy, chiropractic treatment, painkillers and anti-depressants. She
    experienced significant improvement of her symptoms to 80% of normal within the
    first year and a half. She also obtained employment in a very responsible
    career where she has advanced over the years since the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2001, she consulted a lawyer who advised her
    that with soft-tissue injury, she had no case unless there was some visible or
    objective injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite her progress, the appellant’s pain continued
    throughout the period and in September 2005, an MRI scan of the cervical spine
    was suggested and booked for March 2006. That scan revealed a disc bulge at two
    locations. Although the appellant’s family doctor had advised her by May 2004
    that she suffered from a chronic pain condition that could continue for an
    indeterminate time, the MRI result provided objective proof of permanent
    injury, potentially sufficient to base a claim that would meet the statutory “threshold”
    and for which an award would likely exceed the $15,000 statutory deductible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant consulted her current lawyers and commenced
    this action on August&nbsp;1, 2007, against the respondent, the driver of the
    other car involved in the collision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent moved for summary judgment on the basis
    that the action was statute barred as of May 2006, because the appellant knew
    or ought to have known by May 2004, when she was diagnosed with chronic pain,
    that she had a claim that met the requirements of s. 267.5(5<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    I.8: permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental or
    psychological function.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge agreed with the respondent. In so
    doing, he did not address the issue of the $15,000 deductible. He also
    concluded that the appellant had failed to “lead trump” in her evidence on the
    motion because her lawyer’s affidavit on the motion did not disclose the family
    doctor’s diagnosis of chronic pain in May 2004, but relied on the later MRI as
    the determinative factor in the discoverability analysis..</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (1)    Did
    the motion judge err by failing to treat the $15,000 statutory deductible from

  <p class=ParaNO>            (2)       Did
    the motion judge err in his application of the onus of proof on a motion for

  <h3>Issue 1:  Is the ability to achieve
    an award that exceeds the $15,000 statutory deductible a factor in the discoverability
    of a claim for damages arising from an automobile accident under s. 267.5(5) of
    the <i>Insurance Act</i>?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsections 267.5(5) and (7) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> provide:</p>

    damages for non-pecuniary loss under clause 61&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;(e) of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from

    to subsections (5), (12), (13) and (15), in an action for loss or damage from

    of an automobile, the court shall determine the amount of damages for
    non-pecuniary loss to be awarded against a protected defendant in accordance
    with the following rules:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The court shall first
    determine the amount of damages for non-pecuniary loss for which the protected
    defendant would be liable without regard to this Part.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The determination
    under paragraph 1 shall be made in the same manner as a determination of the
    amount of damages for non-pecuniary loss in an action to which this section
    does not apply and, in particular, without regard to,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>i</span>.
    the statutory accident benefits provided for under subsection 268 (1),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii. <span class=GramE>the</span> provisions of this section that protect protected defendants from liability for
    damages for pecuniary loss, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> iii. <span class=GramE>the</span> provisions of paragraph 3.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Subject to subsections
    (8) and (8.1), the amount of damages for non-pecuniary loss to be awarded
    against the protected defendant shall be determined by reducing the amount
    determined under paragraph 1 by,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>i</span>.
    in the case of damages for non-pecuniary loss other than damages for
    non-pecuniary loss under clause 61&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;(e) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    the greater of,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that because the “threshold” for
    an action is described in s. 267.5(5), the $15,000 deductible from any non-pecuniary
    damage award that is mandated in subsection (7)3.i should not be considered a
    condition precedent to the discoverability of a claim that is potentially
    significant enough to meet the statutory requirements of the Act. I reject this
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This issue was fully considered and addressed by
    Gillese J., when she was a judge of the Superior Court, in the case of <i>Voisin v. Hartin</i>, [2000] O.T.C. 931. <a
name="PNUM_32">She explained at para. 32:</a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rationale underlying the discoverability
    principle is that the law ought not to preclude an action before a person is
    able to sue on it. In my view, this rationale requires me to take into account
    the effect of the $10,000 [now $15,000] requirement. It would be fundamentally
    unfair to require the plaintiff to bring an action in which he could not expect
    to recover anything because his claim could not surpass the $10,000 exemption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with this analysis. Clearly it is not the
    policy of the law or the intent of the limitations provisions to require people
    to commence actions before they know that they have a substantial chance to
    succeed in recovering a judgment for damages. These provisions of the <i>Insurance Act</i> were enacted as part of a
    scheme that provides compensation with no-fault benefits for injuries that are
    not considered to be serious or permanent, but allows actions to proceed where
    the injuries are sufficiently significant that a substantial monetary award is
    likely to be recovered. Consequently, the test for the discoverability of the
    existence of such a claim for limitation purposes must be in accordance with
    this same policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE><i>Voisin</i></span> was decided in 2000, applying the discoverability principle from the Supreme
    Court of Canada decision in <span class=SpellE><i>Peixeiro</i></span><i> v.</i> <span
class=SpellE><i>Haberman</i></span>, [1997]
    3 S.C.R. 549, before that principle was codified and defined in the <i>Limitations Act 2002</i>  S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B. The <span
class=SpellE><i>Peixiero</i></span> analysis
    applies to determine whether the plaintiff discovered her claim before January
    1, 2004. On the basis that she did not, then applying<span class=GramE> transition s. 24(5)1 of </span> the <i>Limitations
    Act 2002</i>, the Act applies to the circumstances of this case. Section 4
    provides the basic limitation period of two years from the day the claim was
    discovered for all claims (unless otherwise provided in the Act). Section 5 of
    the Act defines discoverability for the purposes of the Act as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P95_3168"></a><a name=s5s1></a><a
name=BK6></a>5. (1)<span
class=GramE>&nbsp;&nbsp;A</span> claim is discovered on the earlier of,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> day on
    which the person with the claim first knew,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>)  <span
class=GramE>that</span> the injury, loss or damage had occurred,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (ii) <span class=GramE>that</span> the injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or
    omission,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (iii) <span class=GramE>that</span> the act or omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv) <span class=GramE>that</span>,
    having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would
    be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>the</span> day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances of
    the person with the claim first ought to have known of the matters referred to
    in clause (a). </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P103_3870"></a><a name=s5s2></a>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;A
    person with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the matters referred to
    in clause (1) (a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based
    took place, unless the contrary is proved. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The requirement of ss. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)(iv),
    the propriety of a proceeding as a means to obtain a remedy, enhances the
    cogency of the discoverability analysis in <span class=SpellE><i>Voisin</i></span> when applied under the new <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, in arriving at his conclusion regarding
    when the appellant ought to have been aware that she had a claim that
    potentially met the statutory <span class=GramE>criteria,</span> the motion
    judge did not include the $15,000 deductible as one of those criteria. In my
    view, this omission constituted an error.</p>
  <h3>Issue 2:  Did the motion judge err in
    his application of the onus on a motion for summary judgment?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was examined for discovery prior to the
    motion being brought. The respondent relied heavily on the appellant’s evidence
    on discovery as the basis for his motion including the fact that the appellant
    had been advised by her family doctor of the chronic pain diagnosis before May
    2004. The appellant filed her own affidavit as well as the affidavit of her
    solicitor in response, which latter affidavit clearly explained the theory of
    the appellant regarding discoverability, which was that until the MRI scan in
    March 2006, the appellant had no objective evidence that she indeed had
    suffered a “permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental or
    psychological function.” He explained further that the $15,000 deductible must
    be considered in a jury case, as juries often award less than $15,000 for soft
    tissue/whiplash cases. Finally, a plaintiff must consider whether the statutory
    deduction could have the effect of reducing the claim to the jurisdiction of
    the Simplified Procedure or the Small Claims Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge criticised the solicitor for failing
    to mention in his affidavit the earlier diagnosis of chronic pain by the
    appellant’s family doctor, and concluded that this omission constituted a
    failure by the appellant to “lead trump” or to “put her best foot forward”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this criticism of the solicitor was
    unwarranted and misconceives the onus requirements on a summary judgment
    motion. There was no attempt to hide evidence or to mislead the court. The full
    picture of the history of the diagnosis and treatment of the appellant’s injuries,
    including the diagnosis of chronic pain, was disclosed in the record. The
    solicitor’s affidavit was filed for the express purpose of putting the
    appellant’s best foot forward by explaining why the court should conclude that the
    action was commenced within the limitation period or that there was at least a
    genuine issue for trial as to when the limitation period commenced on the facts
    of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The solicitor was responding to the position that the
    chronic pain diagnosis in May 2004 constituted the commencement point of the
    limitation period. His response was that the appellant did not discover that
    her condition was significant enough in seriousness, permanence and in
    quantifiable damage ($15,000 minimum), until she learned the results of the MRI
    scan over two years later.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two errors by the motion judge led him to the
    conclusion that the discoverability of a claim by the appellant that met the
    requirements of the <i>Insurance Act</i> was
    not a genuine issue for trial. That conclusion was not warranted on the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and set aside the order
    granting summary judgment dismissing the action, with costs of the appeal fixed
    at $8,000 inclusive of disbursements, plus G.S.T. As the order granting summary
    judgment is set aside, the appellant is also entitled to her costs below on the
    partial indemnity scale. If the parties cannot agree, then the amount of those
    costs shall be fixed by the motion judge.</p>
