  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns a cottage structure that has been
    submerged and uninhabited for over 14 years.  The respondent now seeks to obtain a building permit to raise the
    building out of the water and renovate it.  The appellants maintain that the proposed repairs and resumption of use
    of the building as a cottage are not permitted by the zoning bylaws of the town
    nor are they allowed as a nonconforming use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central legal issue raised by this case is whether
    the intention of successive parties to carry out the required remedial work is
    sufficient to preserve the legal nonconforming use status of the cottage for
    the 14 years that it remained uninhabitable. A secondary issue is whether the
    land in question may be used for the purpose of boat docking.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    subject property is located on the western bank of the Schomberg River.  The property fronts onto a private roadway
    known as “Private Drive”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    1958, the property was owned by Maurice Delight.  On the site, he built a two-storey boathouse
    with a loft equipped with a sink, hot plate, cupboard, toilet and sleeping
    area.  In 1961, the property was sold to
    Ernest Luff who, in 1963, built the now submerged cottage.  Mr. Luff resided in the cottage, used the
    boat house to store personal property, and docked two boats on the property
    from 1963 until his death in 1966.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    property was then sold to Douglas Alder in 1968. The cottage began to sink
    sometime in the 1980. Despite this, Mr. Alder resided in the cottage until
    1991, by which time the building had sunk into the mud to the point that Mr.
    Alder had to wear rubber boots while in the cottage. While residing on the
    property, Mr. Alder, who owned a boat, also used the boathouse.  In 1991, Mr. Alder’s sister convinced him to
    move out of the cottage and reside with her. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    moving out, Mr. Alder periodically attended at the cottage and placed sand
    around it in an attempt to shore it up.  After a period of illness, Mr. Alder passed away in January 1994. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    Alder’s estate did not have the resources necessary to raise the cottage and
    therefore opted to sell the property to Brian Davey in May 1994 for $2.00.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Davey used the land recreationally, placing a tent trailer there as well as
    docking his and his family’s boats.  He
    stated that over the 10-year period that he owned the property he “never gave
    up trying to find affordable techniques to raise the house” but that he simply
    did not have enough money.  During the
    course of his ownership, the boathouse was demolished.</span></p>

    2004, Mr. Davey sold the property to Donald Grant for $20,000.  Mr. Grant’s common-law partner intended to
    use the land residentially but, in the interim, leased the land to tenants who
    moored their houseboat to the sunken cottage and used the roof of the sunken
    cottage as a sort of deck.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent purchased the property in July 2005.  Prior to selling the property, Mr. Grant’s common-law partner wrote to
    the Lake Simcoe Conservation Authority requesting permission to upgrade the
    cottage’s support pilings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
    the property is within the regulatory flood plain of a provincially significant
    wetland, the respondent Corporation of the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury
    and the Conservation Authority have concurrent jurisdiction over it.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Conservation Authority responded to the inquiry in August 2005 indicating that
    a permit from it was not required for the proposed work.  A copy of this response was sent to the town.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    December 2005, the respondent wrote to the Conservation Authority requesting a
    site clearance for the property.  In the
    letter the respondent indicated that “work to be done to existing building is
    to replace wood negatively affected by mold and decay due to moisture.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    Authority’s response.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    February 2006, the respondent started to raise the submerged cottage.  In late March 2006, representatives of the
    town went to the property in response to a complaint and advised the respondent
    to stop his work as he had not obtained a building permit.  A stop work order followed shortly
    thereafter.  The respondent
    complied.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    September 2006, the respondent applied for a building permit.  The town’s chief building official, the appellant
    Jack Tosta, denied the application because, in his view, the proposed work did
    not comply with the town’s zoning bylaw and, as the cottage had been abandoned,
    it was no longer allowed as a legal nonconforming use.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Zoning Bylaws</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    zoning bylaws respecting the use of the subject property have changed over
    time.  In 1958, when the boathouse and
    loft were built, Bylaw 869 was in effect.  Pursuant to this bylaw, no dwelling or accessory building could be
    erected on a lot having “street frontage” of less than 40 feet.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    1963, when the cottage was built, Bylaw 1009 was in effect.  It zoned the property as agricultural but
    allowed for the construction of a cottage on such lands provided that the
    cottage fronted on a public street or highway and was not occupied more than 6
    months in any calendar year. It also permitted buildings used for, amongst
    other things, the storage of boats.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    1971, Bylaw 2263 came into force.  Pursuant to that bylaw, the land continued to be zoned agricultural,
    however, a person could not use the land or erect or use a building or
    structure except for listed agricultural uses.  The listed uses did not include building or using a cottage building or
    using a property for docking a boat.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    application judge found that, as of the date that Bylaw 2263 came into effect,
    the land, cottage and boathouse had always been lawfully used by the property
    owners and these uses had not been abandoned or otherwise discontinued within
    the meaning of the law. Consequently, the current owners had a legal
    nonconforming use with respect to the property and buildings.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    appeal, the appellants argue that:</span></p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
lang=EN-US>1.   the
    property was never lawfully used for residential purposes and, when it was
    built, the construction and residential use of the cottage was not lawful; and</span></p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'><span
lang=EN-US>2.   in
    any event, the use of the property and cottage for residential purposes has not
    been continuous since Mr. Alder vacated the cottage in 1991, and, as a result,
    any status as legal nonconforming use was lost.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the application judge erred in
    concluding that any legal nonconforming use of the cottage that may have
    existed when Bylaw 2263 was adopted has continued to the present day.  As a result, I need not address the first
    issue raised by the appellants and will assume, without deciding, that the use
    in 1971 of the cottage was lawful. However, I am also of the opinion that the
    respondent does enjoy a right to use the property for the purpose of docking
    boats, though they do not have a right to erect any new structures for this
    purpose.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is accepted by the parties that the property’s current zoning prohibits the
    construction of a cottage and prohibits the use of any building located on the
    property as a cottage.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue, therefore, is whether the respondent is entitled to carry out the
    remedial work on the sunken structure on the basis that the status of the
    building as a legal nonconforming use was never lost. </span></p>

    nonconforming uses constitute exceptions to the requirement that property
    owners must comply with municipal zoning bylaws.  Provision for nonconforming uses is made in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As set out in Ian MacFee Rogers &amp; Alison Scott
    Butler, <i>Canadian Law of Planning and
    Zoning</i>, 2d ed., looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 2009), at para. 6.2.1:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The general intention of planning legislation is
    eventually to eliminate non-conforming uses and replace them with permitted
    uses; thus the council may be said to zone out such uses.  This is based on the premise that such a use
    is undesirable because it is incompatible with the existing permitted uses but
    is to be tolerated because it was a lawful use prior to its prohibition by
    by-law.  It has been said that gradual
    elevation of a district is an end towards which progress should always be made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    indicated earlier, I will, for purposes of this decision, assume that the
    original construction and use of the now-sunken cottage constituted a permitted
    use at the time that Bylaw 2263 was enacted.  I will also assume that the use continued at least until Mr. Alder moved
    out in 1991.  The remaining issue,
    therefore, is whether the legal nonconforming use status was lost in the period
    between 1991 and 2005.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent maintains that the legal nonconforming
    use status of the cottage was not lost.  In support of his submission he argues that, as found by the application
    judge, there was continuous use of the property for residential purposes and,
    even if the use for residential purposes was discontinued as a result of the
    cottage sinking into the water and mud, each of the successive owners intended
    to return the cottage to use.  Such an
    ongoing intention serves to preserve the legal nonconforming use status of the
    building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The critical period for analysis is from 1991 when Mr.
    Alder moved out of the cottage until 2005, when the respondent purchased the
    property.  It is uncontested that during
    this period the cottage was uninhabitable as it was largely submerged in the
    Schomberg River. In the absence of actual habitation, was the intention to use
    the cottage enough to prevent the loss of the nonconforming use during this
    period?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To establish a legal nonconforming use s. 34(9) of the <i>Planning Act</i> provides that the
    respondent must establish both an intention to use and the continuation of the
    actual use so far as possible in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that both elements of the
    test were satisfied for the relevant period.  Specifically, the court found that even though the cottage was
    uninhabitable during that period, Mr. Alder did not have the funds to carry out
    the repairs, Mr. Davey had maintained the residential use of the property as
    far as possible through his regular use of a tent trailer and Mr. Grant’s
    common-law partner maintained the use to the extent possible by renting the
    property to tenants who used the cottage as a place to dock their
    houseboat.  With respect to the 10 years
    of ownership by Mr. Davey, the application judge accepted Mr. Davey’s testimony
    that he always intended to raise the cottage and use it as a residence but that
    he was impecunious.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Was the
    cottage used?</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge erred by conflating
    the use of the land for a purpose such as parking his tent trailer with the use
    of the cottage.  The central issue is the
    respondent’s ability to raise the cottage out of the mud and water, reconstruct
    it and put it back into use and the application judge’s order requiring the
    issuance of the required building permit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1971 when Bylaw 2263 was passed, Mr. Alder was
    residing in the cottage and, in addition, was using the balance of the property
    for recreational purposes such as the docking of his boat.  The Bylaw restricted both the use of the
    property and the erection and use of any structure, except for certain listed
    agricultural uses.  Residential or
    recreational uses were not allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bylaw 2263 provided that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nothing in this Bylaw shall prevent the continuance
    in any Zone of a use existing on the date of the passage of this Bylaw,
    including the repair and renovation of existing buildings subject to the
    provisions of this Bylaw respecting setback, yard requirements and height, so
    long as it continues to be used for the same purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the bylaw, “use” is defined as “the purpose for
    which <i>a lot or building or structure or
    any combination thereof</i> is designed, arranged, occupied or maintained”
    (emphasis added).  The definition
    therefore clearly makes a distinction between the lot and the building or
    structures erected thereon.  This
    distinction is consistent with s. 34(9) of the <i>Planning Act</i> where the same distinction is made in para. (a)
    between use of land, a building, or a structure.  As a result, the use made of the lots and
    existing buildings should be looked at separately from erecting or rebuilding a
    structure when considering nonconforming uses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this distinction in mind, I turn now to a brief
    review of the relevant facts as they relate to the use of the cottage
    structure.  Until 1991, Mr. Alder lived
    full time in the cottage.  As it sunk
    into the mud and water he attempted to shore up the building and continued to
    use it until the water in the cottage became too deep.  Although he left the cottage in 1991, he
    maintained an intention to fix the problem and return to live in the
    cottage.  He did not have the money to
    raise the cottage, but he did periodically place sand around the building in an
    attempt to stop its sinking.  He later
    became ill and died in 1994 without having carried out the intended repairs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By 1994, after Mr. Alder’s death, the estate became
    concerned about the potential liability with respect to the property as it
    could not afford to retain someone to take down or secure the boathouse or cottage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, in 1994, the estate decided to sell to a
    neighbour, Lorraine Davey.  Because Davey
    did not want the property to merge with neighbouring properties that she owned,
    she decided that her son Brian Davey would purchase it.  Mr. Davey then purchased the property for
    $2.  As a result of this purchase the
    Davey family now owned four properties on Private Drive:  The subject property No. 27, as well as No.
    37, No. 41 and No. 47.  Lorraine Davey
    resided seasonally at No. 37 and her mother resided seasonally at No. 47.  From the record it is not clear who, if
    anyone, resided at No. 41.  The
    structures at No. 37 and 47 had also previously begun to sink into the
    mud.  They were raised and placed onto
    new piles in the 1980s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brian Davey deposed that he and his mother “enjoyed the
    use of our family’s properties on Private Drive over the years” and, with
    respect to the subject property “I docked my boats on the property as well as
    my family’s other boats.  I placed a tent
    trailer on the land and resided in it when I was present on the land, which was
    a very quiet and scenic location next to the river.”  Mr. Davey also used a backhoe to create
    parking spaces on the property that were used for his and his family members’
    vehicles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The four Davey properties on Private Drive appear,
    therefore, to have operated as a type of family compound with the subject
    property being used as a place to dock family boats and park family cars.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brian Davey’s use of the property, to dock boats and
    occasionally to stay in a tent trailer is of little relevance to the continued
    use of the cottage structure.  On the
    evidence, it is clear that from 1994 to 2004, use of the cottage structure for
    the purpose for which it had been built had been wholly discontinued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the fact that in 2004 and 2005 the property
    was rented to tenants who docked the houseboat to the roof of the cottage and
    who used the cottage roof as a deck does not, in my view, constitute use of the
    cottage for the purpose for which the building was designed, arranged, occupied
    or maintained as required by the bylaw. It cannot be maintained that docking a
    house boat on the roof of the cottage falls within the properly defined scope
    of the original nonconforming use; it is not a change in intensity, but rather
    a change in kind: see <i>Saint-Romuald
    (City) v. Oliver</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 898. It cannot, therefore, amount to the
    “residential use of the bungalow” as the application judge found.  In any event, even if it amounted to
    residential use, it could not revive a legal nonconforming use if that use had
    been lost over the course of the preceding 10 years.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Was the intention to repair the cottage sufficient to
    preserve the right?</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues that Mr. Davey’s intention to
    raise the cottage out of the mud and water and renovate it was sufficient to
    preserve the legal nonconforming use even if use of the cottage had been wholly
    discontinued during that period.  I
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Haldimand-Norfolk
    (Regional Municipality) v. Fagundes</i> (2000), 11 M.P.L.R. (3d) 1, this court
    quoted with approval the Ontario Municipal Board’s decision in <i>572989 Ontario Inc. v. North York (City)
    Committee of Adjustment</i>, [1997] O.M.B.D. No. 976 (QL) wherein the Board
    found, at para. 10, that “In all the cases of vacancy where the Court or the
    Board found that the use had continued despite the vacancy, there was some
    reasonable explanation for the vacancy or some circumstance at least partially
    outside the owner’s control that temporarily prevented the use” and that “if
    intention was determinative, the intention was at least an active intention
    consistent with the spirit of the provision.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the evidence in this case falls far short
    of the active intention consistent with the spirit of s. 34(9) of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the application judge relied on Mr. Davey’s
    impecuniosity to explain his failure to undertake the work necessary to raise
    the cottage and render it habitable, in my view, a lack of funds cannot justify
    inaction in the circumstances of this case for such an extensive period.  Impecuniosity may well be a valid consideration
    for Mr. Alder who had been residing in the cottage for many years prior to its
    sinking into the mud and water.  His lack
    of funds and illness were circumstances truly beyond his control, and his
    continued genuine intention to use the cottage and the steps he took to try and
    shore up the cottage may well have preserved the nonconforming use during his
    tenure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The situation, however, is quite different for Mr.
    Davey.  He purchased the property for $2
    fully aware of the need to raise the cottage if the nonconforming use was to be
    preserved.  The fact that he did not have
    the funds to do so cannot, in light of his informed choice to purchase the
    property, preserve the nonconforming use status of the cottage for the 10 years
    that he owned it.  A purchaser of a
    property in circumstances such as these needs to do more than simply maintain
    an intention to resume use of the property.  The intention to resume a use must be coupled with reasonable steps to
    resume that use.  Keeping in mind the
    general intention of the planning legislation to eventually eliminate
    nonconforming uses, it is neither unfair nor inequitable to require that Mr.
    Davey, as purchaser, act within a reasonable time to resume the use in
    question.  He simply cannot justify such
    an extensive delay by reference to costs he knew or ought to have known would
    have had to be incurred when he made the decision to purchase.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Use of the Land for Boat Docking</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the residential use of the cottage has
    been lost, I am of the view that the respondent continues to enjoy a right to
    use the land generally for the docking of boats.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    affidavit of John Luff indicated that, as early as 1953, boats had been docked
    at the subject property. A photograph taken in 1953 and attached as an exhibit to
    his affidavit shows a docked boat on the river at 27 Private Drive. During this
    period, the property was zoned under Bylaw 869. While this bylaw prohibited a “garage
    or other outbuilding” from being used as a “residence or living quarters” and
    regulated the erection of a “dwelling or accessory building”, it neither
    prohibited the docking of boats nor barred the erection of a dock on the
    subject property. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge found that Luff, Alder,
    Davey and Grant each docked boats or allowed boats to be docked on the land
    during their respective periods of ownership. These activities could, as I have
    noted, be traced back to the docking of boats on the property in 1953, even
    prior to the erection of the boathouse by Maurice Delight around the spring of
    1958, and certainly prior to the passage of Bylaw 1009. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the appellants argue that the boathouse
    was never lawfully erected as it violated the “street frontage” requirements
    contained in Bylaw 869, in my view, this does not affect the legality of the
    docking of boats that occurred in the 1950s. As I have already noted, Bylaw 869
    did not prohibit the erection of a dock, nor did it prohibit the use of land
    for boat docking purposes. This use of 27 Private Drive was a permitted use from
    1953-1958, and the owners of the subject property have continuously put the
    property to this use ever since. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the practical ability to use the land
    to dock boats may be limited by the destruction of the boathouse and the
    inability to raise the cottage, I see no reason to interfere with the
    application judge’s finding that such activities occurred since before the
    passage of Bylaw 869. It follows that in all of the circumstances, this
    particular nonconforming use continues to this day. However, as I have noted
    previously, a use referable to the land does not automatically give rise to a
    right to erect or rebuild new structures or buildings. While the respondent may
    continue to dock boats on the property, this does not mean that he has a right
    to erect new structures for that purpose, unless they conform with the current
    zoning Bylaw.</p>

    respondent takes the position that the letters sent to the conservation
    authority put the Municipality on notice as to his plans to raise the cottage,
    and by their silence, they have become estopped from opposing his attempts to
    do so. Although the respondent argued estoppel before the application judge,
    the application judge made no finding in that regard.  The respondent asks that, in the event the
    appeal is granted, the matter be remitted to the court of first instance to
    consider the issue of estoppel.  I see no
    reason to do so.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[A] person who makes an unambiguous

    to act inconsistently with that representation. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where
    a party seeks to invoke estoppel on the basis of silence, they must show that
    the party to be estopped was under a duty to make a statement, in the sense
    that in all of the circumstances their failure to communicate the actual state
    of affairs to the other party is dishonest: see <i>Fung Kai Sun v. Chan Fui Hing</i>, [1951] A.C. 489 (P.C.), at p. 501.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    estoppel argument is based, almost exclusively, on the fact that a copy of two
    pieces of correspondence from the Conservation Authority were sent to the
    town.  Both documents simply state that
    “[t]he type of work shown on the attached plan does not require a permit from
    the Conservation Authority.” It did not indicate or even suggest that the work
    did not require approval by the chief building official of the town. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The fact that the town received a copy of
    these letters did not impose a duty on the town to advise the respondent of his
    obligations under the law or to otherwise act in response to their receipt. The
    town’s silence could not reasonably be said to constitute a “dishonest”
    assertion that the respondents did not require a <i>municipal</i> building permit. At its highest, the Municipality might
    be estopped from arguing that a permit from the conservation authority was
    required. This argument has never been relied upon by the respondent.</span></p>
