  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was convicted of trafficking in 7.0
    kilograms of methamphetamine and 2.2 kilograms of marihuana.  He was sentenced to six years less credit of
    seven months for pre-sentence custody and house arrest.  The issue on this Crown appeal is whether the
    sentence is manifestly unfit in view of the fact that methamphetamine is now a
    Schedule I drug.  In addition, the Crown
    appeals the refusal of  the sentencing
    judge to impose a fine in lieu of forfeiture pursuant to ss. 462.37(1) and (3)
    of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>on the basis
    that the respondent had no means to pay a fine. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge noted that, although the
    respondent had a lengthy record, the longest sentence he had previously served
    was equivalent to seven months, with credit given on a two-for-one basis for two
    months of pre-trial custody.  While the appellant
    had trafficked in marihuana, it does not appear he had trafficked in
    methamphetamine prior to the undercover officer’s request to supply him with
    the drug.  The sentencing judge also took
    into account the fact that the appellant was a methamphetamine addict
    throughout the fourteen-month period over which the transactions took
    place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the greater quantity of methamphetamine was
    trafficked after the change in the Schedule making the trafficking in
    methamphetamine a more serious offence, the chain of offences was initiated by
    the undercover officer before that change. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the respondent’s sentencing hearing, the trial judge
    was alerted by the respondent himself to certain acts of cooperation by him
    with the police and, while she did not mention this fact, it may have been a
    factor in the sentence imposed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the particular circumstances of this case, while the
    sentence is low, we would not interfere.  Given our conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to deal with the
    respondent’s application to admit fresh evidence concerning his cooperation
    with the police subsequent to being sentenced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn now to the issue of whether the trial judge
    erred in not imposing a fine in lieu of forfeiture of the buy money which no
    longer existed.  The trial judge’s
    decision was made on the basis of the respondent’s inability to pay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant sections provide as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>462.37(1) Subject to this section and sections
    462.39 to 462.41, where an offender is convicted, or discharged under section
    730, of a designated offence and the court imposing sentence on the offender,
    on application of the Attorney General, is satisfied, on a balance of
    probabilities, that any property is proceeds of crime and that the designated
    offence was committed in relation to that property, the court shall order that the
    property be forfeited to Her Majesty to be disposed of as the Attorney General
    directs or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the law.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>462.37(3) If a court is
    satisfied that an order of forfeiture under subsection (1) or (2.01) should be
    made in respect of any property of an offender but that the property or any
    part of or interest in the property cannot be made subject to an order, the
    court may, instead of ordering the property or any part of or interest in the
    property to be forfeited, order the offender to pay a fine in an amount equal
    to the value of the property or the part of or interest in the property.  In particular, a court may order the offender
    to pay a fine if the property or any part of or interest in the property </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       <span class=GramE>cannot</span>, on the
    exercise of due diligence, be located;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       <span class=GramE>has</span> been
    transferred to a third party;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=GramE>c</span>)       is located outside Canada;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)       <span class=GramE>has</span> been
    substantially diminished in value or rendered worthless; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e)       <span class=GramE>has</span> been
    commingled with other property that cannot be divided without difficulty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s counsel concedes that, in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Lavigne</span></i>,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 392, the Supreme Court held that ability to pay is not a factor
    to be considered in determining the fine under s. 462.37, but is a consideration
    in determining the time to be given to the offender to pay the fine and in
    determining whether a warrant should issue for non-payment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits, however, that whether or not to
    order a fine in lieu of forfeiture is a matter for the sentencing court’s
    discretion.  The respondent no longer has
    the buy money of $37,100 that was given to him by the undercover officer.  He submits that the court should conclude
    that the money went to the supplier who was higher up in the chain and to feed
    his drug habit.  Accordingly, the
    respondent submits that he cannot be said to have benefitted from the major
    portion of the funds given to him and that, although the sentencing judge erred
    in considering ability to pay, it was within her discretion not to order
    payment of a fine.  The respondent
    suggests in effect that the word “<span class=GramE>may</span>” in s. 462.37(3)
    gives a sentencing judge a broad discretion whether to impose a fine in lieu of
    forfeiture, in keeping with the normal principles of sentencing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Lavigne</i></span>, the Supreme Court clarified that the discretion given
    by the use of the word “may” is discretion with respect to whether or not it is
    appropriate to impose a fine instead of forfeiture, rather than ordering
    forfeiture itself.  The discretion to
    impose a fine can be exercised only where the court cannot order forfeiture or
    where forfeiture is not practicable.  In
    particular, a court may order the offender to pay a fine if the property or any
    part of or interest in the property (a) cannot, on the exercise of due
    diligence, be located; (b) has been transferred to a third party; (c) is
    located outside Canada; (d) has been substantially diminished in value or
    rendered worthless; or (e) has been commingled with other property that cannot
    be divided without difficulty. See <span class=SpellE><i>Lavigne</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 22-27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court went on to clarify that the section
    does not require that the sentencing judge <i>must</i> impose a fine in lieu of forfeiture in every situation where an order of
    forfeiture is not possible [see para. 28].  “May” is not equivalent to “shall”.  The Court explained that there may be
    circumstances in which the objectives of the provisions do not call for a fine
    to be imposed at all.  As <span
class=SpellE>Deschamps</span> J. observed at para. 35: “The court’s discretion
    applies both to the decision whether or not to impose a fine and to the
    determination of the value of the property.”  An example of this would be “if the offender
    did not profit from the crime and if it was an isolated crime committed by an
    offender acting alone” [see para. 28].  In
    that case, “none of the objectives would be furthered or frustrated by a
    decision not to impose a fine instead of forfeiture” [see para. 28].  The Court found that “the word ‘may’ <span
class=GramE>allows</span> for an exercise of discretion that is consistent with
    the spirit of the whole of the provisions in question” [see para. 28]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the Court explained that the mere fact
    that property has been used cannot justify exercising the discretion not to
    impose a fine: <span class=SpellE><i>Lavigne</i></span>,
    at para 32.  Thus, in the present case,
    the fact that the money had been spent did not foreclose the possibility of a
    fine. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Lavigne</i></span> the sentencing judge was convinced that the accused
    had received $150,000 in proceeds of crime.  However, there was a lack of evidence that the accused still possessed
    that amount.  In lieu of forfeiture, the
    sentencing judge fined the accused $20,000.  The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the basis that the
    sentencing judge had discretion whether to order the fine.  The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the
    appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Quebec as
    regards the fine, and sentenced the offender to pay a fine of $150,000
    instead.  It then remanded the case to
    the Court of Quebec to determine the time limit for payment and the term of
    imprisonment that would apply in the event of a failure to pay the fine. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to <span class=SpellE><i><span lang=EN-US>Lavigne</span></i></span><span lang=EN-US>,
    we are satisfied that the sentencing judge erred in not imposing a fine in lieu
    of forfeiture.  </span>The respondent
    received $37,100 in drug buy money.  He
    did not act alone and his actions extended over a considerable period of
    time.  Receiving the money was a
    “benefit” in keeping with the purpose of the provisions.  What the respondent then chose to do with the
    money (i.e. pay his supplier, purchase drugs, etc.) need not be the subject of inquiry
    by the sentencing judge as the Supreme Court’s decision in <span class=SpellE><i>Lavigne</i></span><i> </i>illustrates.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, while leave to appeal sentence is
    granted, we dismiss the appeal as to the length of imprisonment.  In regard to the issue of whether the
    sentencing judge should have ordered the respondent to pay a fine instead of
    forfeiture, we hereby allow the appeal and sentence the respondent to pay a
    fine of $37,100.  The case is remanded to
    the sentencing court to determine the time limit for payment and, in the event
    of a failure to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment in accordance with the
    provisions of s. 462.37(4). </p>
