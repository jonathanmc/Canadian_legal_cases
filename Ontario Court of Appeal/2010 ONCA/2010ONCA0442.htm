lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Chow was charged on March 4, 2005 with the offence
    of “drive over 80” pursuant to s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>; he was convicted on May 1, 2006 and his summary
    conviction appeal was dismissed on May 5, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the Crown called as witnesses, the arresting
    officer who had stopped Mr. Chow’s car, and the Intoxilyzer technician who had
    made the breath demand and operated the Intoxilyzer machine to obtain two
    breath samples from Mr. Chow.  The Crown
    also filed the Certificate of a Qualified Technician that had been filled out
    by the Intoxilyzer technician as an exhibit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Chow testified and called two other witnesses in
    his defence; a friend who was drinking with him on the night in question, and a
    toxicologist.  Mr. Chow and his friend
    testified that on the evening of the alleged offence, they had been eating
    dinner at a restaurant together for almost five hours, and Mr. Chow had drunk
    six bottles of light beer at the restaurant.  The defence toxicologist testified and calculated that on the basis of
    Mr. Chow’s version of events — as given at trial — Mr. Chow’s blood alcohol
    would have been between 11 and 68.5 mgs. <span class=GramE>of</span> alcohol
    per 100 ml. of blood at the time he was stopped by the police, approximately
    one hour after he left the restaurant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the argument regarding the
    expiry date of the standard alcohol solution was based on speculation.  He found the evidence of Mr. Chow and his
    friend to be unreliable as to the amount of alcohol consumed by Mr. Chow.  Finally, towards the end of his reasons for
    judgment, the trial judge made a brief, one-sentence reference to a previous
    judgment of his in a case called <i>R. v. Arrechea </i>[2006] O.J. No. 1562
    (C.J.): “In considering the defence ‘evidence to the contrary’ I take into
    account the rigorous circumstances of testing as referred to in <i>Arrechea</i>”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 5, 2008, Boyko J., in brief reasons, dismissed
    Mr. Chow’s appeal.  He now seeks leave to
    appeal to this court on virtually the same grounds of appeal heard by the
    summary conviction appeal judge.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>The arguments for leave</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Chow advanced several arguments, which he
    says demonstrate errors of law made by the appeal judge and which have
    importance beyond this case; namely, the appropriate approach to <i>Carter</i> defences – evidence to the
    contrary in drinking and driving cases.  Specifically,
    he says the appeal judge erred by not meaningfully dealing with the trial
    judge’s reliance on his previous decision in <i>R. v. Arrechea, supra</i>.  He
    argues that the principles in <i>Arrechea</i> have been subsequently rejected
    as being inconsistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Boucher</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Carter</i> defences will normally hinge on the credibility of the accused.  If their drinking pattern evidence is
    credible enough to raise a reasonable doubt, the presumption of accuracy will
    normally be rebutted.  If their evidence
    is not believed, the toxicology evidence loses all weight and the presumption
    will remain.  As Fish&nbsp;J.A. – as he
    then was – stated at para. 92 in <i>R. v. Dubois </i>(1990), <span class=GramE>62&nbsp;C.C.C.
    (3d)</span>&nbsp;90 (Que.&nbsp;C.A.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Evidence to the contrary” that is disbelieved will,
    of course, fail to neutralize, or to render inoperative, the presumption
    created by s.&nbsp;258(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While subsequent case law has divided on the
    application of <i>Boucher</i> to different
    situations, it clearly established that the prohibition against using the results
    recorded on a certificate of analysis applies to those cases in which the Crown
    is relying on the presumption of accuracy.  We would, on this basis, grant leave to appeal.  It is an issue that we accept has some
    importance beyond this case. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>The merits of the appeal</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the instant case, as noted, the trial judge
    made brief comments towards the end of his reasons: “In considering the defence
    ‘evidence to the contrary’ I take into account the rigorous circumstances of
    testing as referred to in <i>Arrechea</i>”.   Mr. Chow argues that the trial judge’s reliance on his previous decision
    is illogical, since the <span style='line-height:
200%'>“</span>rigorous circumstances of breath testing” mean nothing without
    relying on the breath test results.  He
    also contends that such reliance is contrary to <i>Boucher</i>.  We agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Logically we see little difference between relying on
    the certificate itself on the one hand, and the circumstances of the test on
    the other.  The circumstances of the test
    could only be relevant with respect to the credibility of <i>Carter</i> evidence in so far as they ‘flow through’ the test
    results.  While they, as a factual
    matter, bolster the reliability of the test result, logically, this reasoning
    still requires consideration of the test results.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, however, the Crown filed the
    certificate and called as witnesses the arresting officer who had stopped Mr.
    Chow’s car, and the Intoxilyzer technician who had made the breath demand and
    operated the Intoxilyzer machine to obtain two breath samples from Mr. Chow.  It therefore becomes unnecessary to examine
    the <i>Boucher</i> principle in the context
    of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put another way, where the <i>viva voce</i> testimony of the Intoxilyzer technician is presented –
    instead of or in addition to the filing of the technician’s certificate alone
    to prove the Intoxilyzer results – there is no need to rely on the presumption
    of accuracy.  The Crown can be taken to simply
    prove the test results in the ordinary course.  In these circumstances the trial judge is entitled to view all of the
    evidence, including the surrounding circumstances and the testimony of the
    witnesses.  It is therefore not an error for the breathalyzer
    results to be taken into consideration when assessing the credibility of
    defence evidence because the presumption of accuracy is not being relied on. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had this been a case of the Crown relying on the
    presumption of accuracy, the trial judge would have been in error in relying on
    the circumstances of testing as that would be contrary to <i>Boucher</i>.  This case was not
    about the presumption of accuracy.  Thus,
    the appeal judge, while not fully analyzing this issue, did not err in her
    result.  This ground of appeal is
    therefore rejected.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Bill C-2</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During oral argument, we asked the parties about the
    effects of Bill C-2 on these issues and the leave application.  We would note that the decision of the appeal
    judge was released before Bill C-2 came into force, and its application was not
    a matter placed before her for consideration.  The parties have since provided brief written submissions.  Having regard to these submissions, and on
    the assumption that the provisions of C-2 are constitutional, we will address it
    very briefly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, no analysis of this issue is necessary
    given the grounds upon which we granted leave to appeal.  We acknowledge that this court has held that
    the provisions of Bill C-2 apply retrospectively: <a name="OLE_LINK1"><i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;</i></a><span class=spelle><i><span style='line-height:200%'>Dineley</span></i></span>,&nbsp;2009
    ONCA 814.  Nevertheless, to decide either
    the question of leave or the merits of the appeal by relying on the provisions
    of Bill C-2 in all the circumstances of this case would be unfair.  We would simply observe that, it seems to us
    that the Crown’s case would likely have succeeded with even more force had Bill
    C-2 been applied.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>The remaining issues</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge specifically found that “[t]he trial
    judge did not err in applying the law, or misapprehend the evidence, in making
    his findings of fact”.  We see no error
    of law by the appeal judge and she properly disposed of the issue in connection
    with the trial judge’s alleged misapprehensions of evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, it was for the trial judge to make the
    findings of fact as to the significance of inconsistencies between the defence
    witness and the appellant, or as to the degree of reliability of the witnesses’
    recollection; there was no underlying misappre-hension of evidence in this
    regard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was also no misapprehension of evidence by the
    trial judge when he found that the defence argument regarding the standard
    alcohol solution was based “entirely on speculation”.  There was nothing in the evidence of the
    defence toxicologist to indicate that the standard alcohol solution had, in
    fact, expired.  Without any misapprehension
    of the evidence, the trial judge was satisfied that the Intoxilyzer was
    ascertained to be in proper working order, and this was a finding of fact.  We fail to see any error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no reversal of the burden of proof.  The trial judge simply conducted an analysis
    of whether Mr. Chow’s evidence was consistent with other evidence in the
    case.  The way in which the appeal judge
    dealt with this ground of appeal was appropriate and did not reflect any error
    of law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the appeal judge did not explicitly
    discuss the issue of “judicial notice” in her reasons.  Nevertheless, she did indicate that the trial
    judge did not err in applying the law when making his findings of fact.  Indeed, the trial judge was not “taking
    judicial notice” of the defence not having requested a sample alcohol standard
    from the lot used to test Mr. Chow, and not having requested the Intoxilyzer
    maintenance logs.  There is no merit to
    this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr. Chow argues that the trial judge took judicial
    notice that Mr. Chow’s estimate of the driving time between the restaurant
    where he was drinking, and the location where he was stopped by the police was
    a “generous estimate”.  The actual context
    of that comment was: “even accepting
    that generous estimate, there is no evidence as to where Mr. Chow was or
    what he was doing for more than 30 minutes in the hour prior to his being
    stopped by police”.  Even if this
    amounted to judicial notice, which we doubt, Mr. Chow was not prejudiced by the
    trial judge considering his time estimate to be “generous”.  This ground of appeal must also be rejected.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, the appeal must be
