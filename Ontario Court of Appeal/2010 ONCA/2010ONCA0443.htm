  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from summary judgment dismissing an
    action that had been certified as a class proceeding.  Under the <i>Motor
    Vehicle Repair Act </i>(since repealed) and the <i>Consumer Protection Act </i>it is unlawful for a vehicle “repairer” to
    charge a fee for an estimate if the consumer authorizes the repair and the
    repair is carried out.  The plaintiff
    class alleges that Mister Transmission International (MTI) breached that
    statutory prohibition by charging fees for estimates when members of the
    plaintiff class authorized and paid for repairs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In certifying the class action, the motions judge
    observed that there was no evidence that the other companies named as
    defendants had anything to do with the issues in this action.  Prior to the motion for summary judgment,
    affidavit evidence was filed indicating these companies were not involved and,
    accordingly, the motions judge dismissed the action against them at para. 56 of
    his reasons.  We would uphold his
    dismissal of the action against them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MTI is a franchisor that has no direct contact with
    customers.  It does, however, through franchise
    agreements and manuals, <span style='line-height:
200%'>set general standards to be followed by its franchisees.  In addition, </span>the franchisees pay MTI seven
    per cent of their revenues.  The
    franchisees are not being sued in this action.  The essence of the claim by the representative
    plaintiff, Dean, is that MTI’s franchisees are actual or apparent agents of MTI
    and that they improperly breached the legislation by charging customers
    estimate fees for a vehicle transmission “Inspection Service” even though the
    customer authorized the repair.  Dean
    also alleges that MTI conspired with its franchisees to breach the statutes.<span
style='line-height:200%'> </span> By receiving a portion of the franchisees’
    revenues for the transmission Inspection Service, Dean further alleges that MTI
    has been unjustly enriched.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The transmission is the component of a vehicle that
    shifts the power from the engine to the wheels.  The transmission is an enclosed sealed unit.  When a customer brings a vehicle to a Mister
    Transmission franchise repair centre, it undergoes a road test and a multi-check.
     If the road test and multi-check
    indicate that the problem is internal to the transmission, requiring further
    diagnosis, the customer is offered an “Inspection Service”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a customer asks, “How much will it cost to fix my
    transmission?” The answer is, “We don’t know until we do the Inspection
    Service.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the Inspection Service is performed, the
    customer is asked whether he/she wishes to have it done, and is given a price
    for it.  The price will vary according to
    the make and model of the vehicle.  The
    customer is also told that, upon completion of the service, the customer will
    be given an exact price for the repair of the transmission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charge for the Inspection Service includes the cost
    of the removal of the transmission from the vehicle, the complete dismantling
    of the transmission and the reinstallation of the transmission into the
    vehicle.  This takes a considerable
    amount of time.  Depending on the
    vehicle, anywhere from three to ten hours of labour are required, and in some
    cases, up to twelve hours.  In the course
    of this exercise, the nature of the problem requiring repair is discovered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the customer goes ahead with the repair, then after
    the transmission is fixed, the customer is given an invoice, on which the
    customer is billed separately for the Inspection Service and the price of the
    repair.  The Inspection Service does not
    include any repair to the vehicle.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MTI’s position is that the franchisees are charging the
    total cost of taking apart the transmission and fixing it.  They are not double billing and not in breach
    of the <i>Motor Vehicle Repair Act</i> and
    the <i>Consumer Protection Act</i>.  The President of MTI, Randall Moore, denies in
    his affidavit that the Inspection Service is an estimate.  Rather, he asserts that the fees are really
    fees for the removal, disassembly, reassembly and reinstallation of the
    transmission, and the diagnosis of the transmission problem is actually done
    for free. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge accepted Moore’s evidence.  On the basis of Moore’s evidence, he
    interpreted s. 3(2) of the MVRA such that a “fee for an estimate” is deemed to
    include the cost of diagnostic time and the cost of reassembly only if the
    repairs are not authorized by the consumer and completed.  The motions judge held at para. 71 of his
    reasons that the clear inference from the legislation was that if the repair is
    authorized by the customer a fee for an estimate shall not include the cost of
    diagnostic time and the cost of reassembling the vehicle.  At para. 72 he noted the evidence of Mr.
    Moore that there was no charge for diagnosis of the problem in the inspection
    fee.  He then held that the Inspection
    Service was not an estimate as contemplated by the statutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge also held that even if the statutes
    were interpreted in the appellant’s favour and charging for the Inspection
    Service fees was the unlawful charging of an estimate fees, MTI was not
    unjustly enriched by its receipt of part of these fees because MTI’s agreement
    to receive seven per cent of the revenues from its franchisees was not illegal.
     In any event, the amounts charged by the
    franchisees for the labour to remove the transmission, was fair and thus, not a
    detriment to the plaintiff <span class=GramE>nor</span> an enrichment of the
    franchisees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motions judge also determined that MTI </span>franchisees
    were not agents of MTI and MTI had not breached the statutes because it was not
    a “repairer”.  He dismissed the claim for
    conspiracy on the basis that the damages resulting from the alleged conspiracy
    were not separate and distinct from those allegedly suffered as a result of the
    claim for breach of the statute but merged.  See <span class=SpellE><i>Normart</i></span><i> Management
    Ltd. v. West Hill Redevelopment Co.</i> (1998), <span class=GramE>113 O.A.C.
    375</span>.<span style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before us, Dean brought a motion seeking to have
    admitted as fresh evidence a portion of the training manual dealing with the
    Inspection Service that MTI provides to franchisees.  It instructs franchisees to tell customers
    that the fee includes, among other things, a charge for diagnosis.  This is inconsistent with Mr. Moore’s
    evidence.   Furthermore, the manual also appears to
    instruct franchisees that if any customer specifically questions the obligation
    to pay for the Inspection Service on a completed repair, franchisees are to
    tell the customers that they do not have to pay for the Inspection Service if
    the repair is authorized and carried out.  On its face, the training manual appears to be inconsistent with Moore’s
    evidence and with the position taken by MTI. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his cross-examination, Mr. Moore was asked to
    produce a copy of the training manual.  Counsel
    for MTI, responding for Mr. Moore, advised that his firm had a copy of the
    training manual and that he had reviewed it, but there was nothing in the
    training manual that was relevant to the matters in issue.  At another point in the cross-examination,
    counsel for MTI indicates that he would review the training manual and produce
    any parts of it relevant to the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After summary judgment was granted, counsel for Dean
    obtained a copy of the training manual from a former franchisee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dean’s motion to have this evidence, attached as an
    exhibit to an affidavit, admitted as fresh evidence was initially opposed by
    counsel for MTI on the basis that it was not relevant and that Dean had not
    exercised due diligence by bringing a motion to have it produced.  However, when the court pointed out to
    counsel for MTI that it was of the opinion he had misled his friend on the
    cross-examination, he apologized and explained he had not intended to do so.  He also later indicated that if he was
    successful on the motion he would not be seeking any costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We admit the fresh evidence.  The due diligence test for the admission of
    fresh evidence is less significant when the evidence is in the hands of a party
    against whom it is tendered and there was an obligation on the party to
    disclose or to produce it.  See: <i>R. Clancy Heavy Equipment Sales Ltd. v. Joe <span
class=SpellE>Gourley</span> Construction Ltd. </i>(2001), A.B.C.A. 114 (Alta.
    C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the fresh evidence calls for an
    explanation from MTI.  Without that
    explanation, the motions judge, through no fault of his own, simply did not
    have a full and fair record sufficient to pronounce judgment on this case.  The exercise of statutory interpretation is a
    contextual one that ought to be done with the benefit of a full and fair record.
     In the circumstances, without taking any
    position on the correctness of the motions judge’s interpretation of the
    legislation, we are of the opinion that the summary judgment must be set
    aside.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dean submits that the motions judge erred in that if MTI
    is not a repairer under the Act it could have committed the tort of conspiracy
    if it entered into an agreement with the franchisees to charge unlawful
    estimate fees.  If the fees were
    unlawful, and if, as MTI submits, it was not a “repairer” under the Act, the
    claim for conspiracy would not merge with the claim for breach of statute. See
    e.g. <i>Andersen Consulting Ltd. v. Canada
    (Attorney General) </i>(2001), 150 O. A.C.177 (C.A).  MTI concedes that on those assumptions, the
    claim for conspiracy would not merge.  Thus, a genuine issue for trial exists as to whether a conspiracy
    between the franchisees and MTI took place.  As there is a genuine issue for trial on the conspiracy claim against
    MTI, we need not address the issues of agency and unjust enrichment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the decision of
    the motions judge is set aside.  Costs of
    the motion before him are awarded to the appellant and are fixed in the amount
    of $40,000 all inclusive.   Costs of the appeal are also to the
    appellant.   We fix those costs in the amount of $30,000
    all inclusive.</p>
