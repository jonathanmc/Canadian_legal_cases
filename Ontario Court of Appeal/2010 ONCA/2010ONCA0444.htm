  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      On October 21, 2000, an apartment building
    located at 1 Summer Hill Road, Toronto caught fire after sparks from the
    appellant’s acetylene torch ignited some nearby highly flammable material. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      The appellant concedes that it was open to
    the trial judge to find that he [the appellant] was negligent when he proceeded
    with torch-cutting angle irons with an acetylene torch while standing on
    scaffolding adjacent to the tar-papered walls of the 13th floor of the
    apartment building. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      However, the trial judge also found that
    the appellant told the respondent’s representative on site that it was too
    dangerous to proceed in these conditions and that the appellant went ahead only
    after the respondent’s representative “instructed him the work had to continue”
    and said, “<span class=GramE>don’t</span> worry about it, if anything happens
    it will be my responsibility.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      The appellant contends that, in the face
    of these findings, the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to the appellant’s
    defence of <span class=SpellE><i>volenti</i></span><i> non fit <span class=SpellE>injuria</span></i>.
    In the alternative, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    allocating fault on a 50-50 basis as between him and the respondent and that
    the trial judge further erred in calculating the quantum of damages caused by
    his negligence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span style='line-height:200%;'>II.        DISCUSSION</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span style='line-height:200%;'>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) The <span

style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      The appellant concedes that the trial
    judge described the test for the <span class=SpellE><i>volenti</i></span> defence correctly. However, he submits the trial
    judge's finding that <span class=SpellE><i>volenti</i></span> does not apply in this case is unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      We disagree. The trial judge gave careful
    reasons for concluding the defence of <span class=SpellE><i>volenti</i></span> was not available in this case. His findings were
    premised on his review of the appellant's pleadings (in which the appellant
    claimed that the respondent failed to appreciate the risk it created for the
    appellant); his own assessment of the parties' appreciation of the level of
    risk involved in using an acetylene torch in the circumstances; and his
    interpretation of the words spoken by the respondent's representative on
    site.   Although we acknowledge that it may have been
    open to the trial judge to reach a different conclusion concerning the <span
class=SpellE><i>volenti</i></span> defence
    that is not the test applicable on appeal. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      Concerning contributory negligence, as we
    read his reasons, the trial judge premised his apportionment of 50% of the fault
    to the appellant on his conclusion that the appellant was fully aware of the
    significant danger in proceeding with the torch-cutting in the presenting circumstances
    and chose to proceed in any event. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      In our view, although the trial judge made
    reference to the differing positions of the parties (general contractor and
    subcontractor), he erred in failing to give effect to the resulting power
    imbalance that occurred in these circumstances, when apportioning fault.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>      The
    trial judge's central finding concerning the apportionment of fault was that
    the appellant “<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>kn</span></span><span
class=GramE>[</span><span class=SpellE>ew</span>] better” and the respondent “should
    have known better”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>However, in so holding, the trial
    judge failed to give any weight to the significance of the relative positions
    of the parties. Given the respondent’s representative's conduct in effectively directing
    the appellant to proceed, the appellant was subjected to at least some pressure
    to go ahead even though he knew he should not. Although this factor does not
    absolve the appellant of responsibility <span class=SpellE>vis</span>-a-<span
class=SpellE>vis</span> the respondent, it tips the scales of responsibility
    towards the respondent. Despite being warned of the danger by the appellant,
    the respondent exercised its authority and directed the appellant to proceed in
    any event.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>In our view, the trial judge erred
    in principle by failing to consider this factor that was relevant to the
    apportionment of fault. Taking account of this factor, we consider the proper
    apportionment of fault to be 75% to the respondent and 25% to the appellant.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>DAMAGES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span>As for the damages calculation, in our opinion,
    the trial judge erred in including amounts paid by the respondent on account of
    legal fees in relation to litigation pertaining to its insurance coverage as
    part of the damages calculation. The trial judge dealt with this issue as a
    matter of factual causation. In our view, it is an issue of legal causation -- and
    such a claim is simply too remote. On the facts of this case, it was not
    reasonably foreseeable that, as a result of the appellant’s negligence in
    causing the fire, the respondent would have to engage in litigation with its insurer
    concerning coverage issues. </p>
