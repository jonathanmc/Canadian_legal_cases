  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>On
    appeal from conviction by Justice T. David Little of the Superior Court of Justice
    for the possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, dated June 12,
    2009, and from sentence, dated June 12, 2009.</span></h4>
  <p><b><span
lang=EN-US>By The Court:</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine
    for the purpose of trafficking and sentenced to seven months imprisonment (in
    addition to one month credited for pre-trial custody). He appeals in writing
    from conviction and sentence. Although given the opportunity to do so, the
    appellant has filed no written argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction is essentially fact driven.
    The appellant denied being in possession of the cocaine that the police claim
    he disposed of as he was running across the street to a waiting cab. According
    to the appellant, after he and his co-accused entered the cab, his co-accused,
    who was seated in the back seat, opened the rear door of the cab and threw the
    cocaine onto the street. The appellant, who was in the front seat, opened the
    front passenger door and threw a small amount of marijuana underneath the cab.
    He testified that the police had to move the cab to retrieve it. He denied
    having anything to do with the cocaine the police found on the street some
    distance from the cab. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s version of the events conflicted with
    the evidence of the police. Constable Parker testified that the appellant threw
    something onto the street as the appellant was running towards a waiting cab.
    Constable Parker retrieved the item and it turned out to be a bag containing 29
    grams of cocaine. Upon searching the appellant, Constable Parker located a
    small bag containing two grams of marijuana. He denied finding the marijuana
    under the cab. He was asked no questions in cross-examination about having to
    move the cab to retrieve the marijuana – an event that was mentioned for the
    first time by the appellant in his testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable Parker’s partner, Senior Constable Anglin,
    did not see the appellant throw the bag that contained the cocaine. He did,
    however, confirm his partner’s evidence as to the location on the street where
    the bag was found. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the evidence of the police
    officers and rejected the appellant’s testimony. In accepting the evidence of
    Constable Parker and Senior Constable Anglin, the trial judge was alive to various
    discrepancies in their evidence but found the discrepancies to be immaterial.
    The fact that the officers had to refer to their reports to refresh their
    memory was, in his view, of little significance and “likely due to the passage
    of time.” The trial judge accepted Constable Parker’s evidence that the
    marijuana was not found under the cab as the appellant claimed but instead, was
    found on his person. In this regard, he noted that neither Constable Parker nor
    his partner was cross-examined on the need to move the cab to retrieve it
    “because it did not happen.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s testimony. In
    doing so, he pointed out that the appellant changed his testimony, claiming
    initially that he had seen his co-accused throw the cocaine out of the cab and
    then stating that this was an assumption on his part. The trial judge
    characterized the appellant’s evidence as “an after-the-fact fabrication.” In
    this regard, he no doubt took into account the appellant’s failure to
    cross-examine the officers about the need to move the cab to retrieve the
    marijuana – an event which, as noted, was mentioned for the first time during
    the appellant’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge’s reasons disclose no
    error. His credibility findings are supported by the evidence and we see no
    basis for interfering with them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from sentence is also dismissed. The
    sentence has been served and to that extent, the appeal is moot. In any event,
    the sentence was fit in the circumstances.</p>
