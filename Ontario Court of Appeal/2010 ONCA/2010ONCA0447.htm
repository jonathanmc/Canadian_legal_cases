  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    appeal is primarily concerned with the correct interpretation of, and
    relationship between, certain provisions of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.) (<span
class=GramE>the</span> “<i>ITA</i>”) and the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. B-3 (the “<i>BIA</i>”).  Under the provisions of the <i>ITA</i>, the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”)
    is able to seek jeopardy orders, which allow for it to take collection action
    on outstanding amounts assessed owing by a taxpayer, notwithstanding the fact
    that the taxpayer has filed a notice of objection.  Here, the CRA successfully obtained such an
    order from the Federal Court by arguing that the looming receivership of I.
    Waxman &amp; Sons Limited (“IWS”) would preclude collection of the tax
    debt.  The Trustee submits that the
    effect of the jeopardy order – that is, the CRA garnishing funds from its bank
    account – conflicts with the provisions of the <i>BIA</i> which specify that the Crown is an unsecured creditor in a bankruptcy
    proceeding and that a bankruptcy order takes precedence over all other interim
    judgments and orders.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    of September 18, 2006, IWS owed the CRA $1,273,452.10 in respect of corporate
    tax, penalties and interest for 2002, 2003 and 2004, arising from reassessments
    issued in August and September 2006.  On
    October 6, 2006, the CRA received a notice of objection from IWS with respect
    to its 2002 taxation year, and on November 1, 2006, the CRA received notices of
    objection with respect to its 2003 and 2004 taxation years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    February 19, 2007, the CRA issued a requirement to pay notice to the Canadian
    Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”) to collect the amount of $621,415.06 owed by
    IWS.  This amount consisted of the
    portion of the tax debt the CRA was permitted to collect at that time pursuant
    to s. 225.1(7) of the <i>ITA</i>.  Section 225.1(7) of the <i>ITA</i> allows the CRA to collect from a corporation for a taxation
    year in which it is a “large corporation” (which it is undisputed the appellant
    was at all material times) certain amounts determined by the formulae set out
    in the subsection, notwithstanding any objection or appeal of the assessment
    for that year by the corporation.  CIBC
    complied with the requirement to pay notice and the CRA received payment of
    that amount.  This appeal does not relate
    to the payment of this sum by CIBC to the CRA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    notice of motion dated February 28, 2007, Morris Waxman brought an application
    for the appointment of Deloitte &amp; <span class=SpellE>Touche</span> Inc. as
    the receiver of IWS pursuant to the provisions of the Ontario<i> Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. B.16 (the “<i>OBCA</i>”) and the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  The CRA received notice of the application in
    early March 2007.  The application,
    originally returnable on March 7, 2007, was adjourned and heard on March 26, 2007,
    at which time Deloitte &amp; <span class=SpellE>Touche</span> Inc. was
    appointed as receiver.</span></p>

    March 5, 2007, after having applied the sum of $621,415.06 to IWS’s outstanding
    debt for 2002 and 2003, IWS’s debt was reduced to $704,735.53.  The notices of objection filed by IWS precluded
    the CRA from taking collection action in respect of the remaining outstanding
    amount absent a court order authorizing it to do so under s. 225.2 of the <i>ITA</i>, commonly <span class=GramE>called</span> a “jeopardy order”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the time between receiving notice of application to appoint a receiver and the
    application being heard, the CRA sought a jeopardy order.  Specifically, on March 19, 2007, the CRA, as
    the Minister of National Revenue, brought an <i>ex parte </i>application under s. 225.2(2) before the Federal Court
    seeking authorization to take collection action in respect of the outstanding
    amount. On the application, the CRA submitted evidence of IWS’s unwillingness
    to pay its debt and of IWS’s imminent receivership, and argued that, because it
    could take no steps to attempt to collect or to secure its position vis-à-vis
    other creditors, the collection of the debt would be jeopardized by a delay in
    the collection thereof.  The CRA
    explained that if the receivership order were granted, the CRA’s claim in the
    receivership would be unsecured and the stay of proceedings resulting from the
    receivership order would preclude the CRA from doing anything to improve its
    position in the future.  As an unsecured
    claimant, the CRA would only realize <span class=GramE>its</span> pro rata
    share of any funds that remained after the secured creditors, including the
    Ontario Ministry of Finance, were paid.  As the other unsecured claims were upwards of $50 million, it was
    unlikely that the CRA would recover much, if any, of the debt unless <span
class=GramE>a jeopardy</span> order were granted.  On the same day, March 19, 2007, Blanchard J.
    of the Federal Court issued the requested order, which authorized the Minister
    of National Revenue to take forthwith any of the collection measures specified
    in s. 225.1(1)(a) to (g) of the <i>ITA </i>(the
    “jeopardy order”).</span></p>

    in March 2007, plus the interest earned on those funds, against the dividend
    amount to be distributed to the CRA as an unsecured creditor in the IWS estate.  The Trustee advised the CRA that the set-off
    was being asserted on the grounds that the jeopardy order obtained by the CRA
    was ill-founded as there was no evidence of asset dissipation or movement out
    of the jurisdiction, and that the effect of the jeopardy order was to create a
    preference for the benefit of the CRA contrary to the order of priorities as
    set out in the <i>BIA</i>.</span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    her reasons, the motion judge referenced s. 70(1) of the <i>BIA</i> which provides that a bankruptcy order takes precedence over all
    judicial or other attachments, judgments, executions and other process, except
    those that have been completely executed by payment to the creditor.  She concluded that it fell to her to
    determine whether a jeopardy order is an interim order and, if not, whether the
    process was completely executed by payment to the CRA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She
    found that nothing in the statutory language or scheme suggested that the order
    was <span class=GramE>interim</span> in nature or designed to preserve funds;
    rather, the order authorized the CRA to take the collection action
    notwithstanding an objection having been filed by the taxpayer.  She noted that Parliament imposed certain
    constraints, including the need for a court order in which terms that are fit may
    be imposed, and the ability of a taxpayer to seek a review of the jeopardy
    order.  Applying a contextual and
    purposive approach, she concluded that the jeopardy order was not an interim
    preservation order.  Moreover, CIBC’s
    payment of funds to the CRA and the CRA’s application of those funds to IWS’s
    indebtedness, constituted a complete execution of the process and, as such, s.
    70(1) of the <i>BIA</i> did not operate to
    require the CRA to repay the amount or to permit the Trustee to exercise any
    set off.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    the motion judge determined that the exercise of the jeopardy order was not
    contrary to s. 86(1) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    which specifies that, in the bankruptcy context, Crown claims rank as unsecured
    claims. The CRA complied completely with the statutory provisions of the <i>ITA</i>.  Further, s. 70 of the <i>BIA</i> permitted
    the CRA to collect its debt unaffected by any subsequent insolvency. Barring
    certain exceptions, such as fraud, completed executions survive a bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    relation to the Trustee’s argument that she should exercise her equitable
    jurisdiction to subordinate the Crown’s claims, she concluded that while the
    Supreme Court of Canada had left open the question of whether the doctrine of
    equitable subordination should be recognized in Canada, the case before her
    reflected no need to address the issue.  The CRA’s conduct was not inconsistent with the <i>BIA</i>, nor could it be said that it had engaged in inequitable
    conduct.  It acted pursuant to a court
    order that it was entitled to seek.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    relation to s. 73(4) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    which sets out that “[a]<span class=SpellE>ny</span> property of a bankrupt
    under seizure for … taxes shall … be delivered without delay to the trustee …<span
class=GramE>”,</span> she concluded that the section was not directed toward
    facts comparable to those in the case before her. The jurisprudence on the
    section tended to relate to a landlord or municipality acting on rights of
    distress for unpaid rent or taxes.  A
    distress that has been completely executed prior to bankruptcy precludes a trustee
    from recovery under the section since once executed the proceeds cease to be
    property of the bankrupt.  In this case,
    CIBC paid the CRA the funds and the funds were applied to IWS’s indebtedness in
    March 2007. IWS was not declared bankrupt until September 4, 2007.</span></p>

    Trustee argues that this question must be answered in the negative.  Bifurcation was inevitable since the CRA
    initiated <i>ex parte</i> proceedings before
    the Federal Court rather than the Superior Court of Justice which was already
    seized of the receivership application.  The Trustee remains of the view that the jeopardy order was not
    well-founded under the <i>ITA</i>, but does
    not seek to litigate that question before this court.  Instead, the Trustee argues that upon the
    occurrence of bankruptcy further questions arose as to the effect of executing
    the jeopardy order.  These are questions
    of bankruptcy – involving for example the interpretation and application of ss.
    70(1), 73(4) and 86(1) of the <i>BIA</i> –
    over which the Federal Court has no jurisdiction.  In short, the Trustee says it is not

    collection on the eve of insolvency; this is a challenge to the jeopardy order.

    in violation of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal

    was also argued that the appellant was by his action mounting a collateral
    attack on the orders of the Ontario Energy Board that authorized the LPPs.  In considering this argument, <span
class=SpellE>Iacobucci</span> J. stated at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    70-71:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>… <span
class=GramE>the</span> OEB does not have exclusive jurisdiction over this
    dispute.  While the dispute does involve
    rate orders, at its heart it is a private law matter under the competence of
    civil courts and consequently the Board does not have jurisdiction to order the
    remedy sought by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>… <span
class=GramE>this</span> action does not constitute an impermissible collateral
    attack on the OEB’s order.  The doctrine
    of collateral attack prevents a party from undermining previous orders issued
    by a court or administrative tribunal.  Generally, it is invoked where the party is attempting to challenge the
    validity of a binding order in the wrong forum, in the sense that the validity
    of the order comes into question in separate proceedings when that party has
    not used the direct attack procedures that were open to it (i.e., appeal or
    judicial reviews).  <span class=GramE>In <i>Wilson v.</i></span><i> The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, at p. 599, this Court described
    the rule against collateral attack as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>It
    has long been a fundamental rule that a court order, made by a court having
    jurisdiction to make it, stands and is binding and conclusive unless it is set
    aside on appeal or lawfully quashed.  It
    is also well settled in the authorities that such an order may not be attacked
    collaterally – and a collateral attack may be described as an attack made in
    proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation,
    or nullification of the order or judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Based
    on a plain reading of this rule, the doctrine of collateral attack does not
    apply in this case because here the specific object of the appellant’s action
    is not to invalidate or render inoperative the Board’s orders, but rather to
    recover money that was illegally collected by the respondent as a result of
    Board orders. Consequently, the collateral attack doctrine does not apply.  [Citations omitted.]</span></p>

    my view, the case at bar is clearly distinguishable from <i>Garland</i>.   In <i>Garland</i> the orders were only challenged
    in so far as they purported to authorize what was clearly unlawful.  In so far as the orders of the Board sought
    the collection of amounts that were unlawful, they were inoperative.  The <span class=GramE>remainder of the orders
    were</span> not subject to attack, and remained in full force and effect.  The object of the action was not to
    invalidate or render inoperative the Board orders, but rather to recover money
    that was illegally collected by the gas company as a result of the Board’s
    orders.  As the court noted at <span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span
lang=EN-US>            </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>Moreover, the appellant’s case lacks
    other hallmarks of collateral attack.  <span
class=GramE>As <span class=SpellE>McMurtry</span> C.J.O. points out at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>.</span> 30 of his reasons, the collateral attack cases
    all involve a party, bound by an order, seeking to avoid the effect of that
    order by challenging its validity in the wrong forum.  In this case, the appellant is not bound by
    the Board’s <span class=GramE>orders,</span> therefore the rationale behind the
    rule is not invoked.  The fundamental
    policy behind the rule against collateral attack is to “maintain the rule of
    law and to preserve the repute of the administration of justice” (<i>R. v. Litchfield, </i>[1993] 4 S.C.R. 333,
    at p. 349).  The idea is that if a party
    could avoid the consequences of an order issued against it by going to another
    forum, this would undermine the integrity of the justice system.  Consequently, the doctrine is intended to prevent
    a party from circumventing the effect of a decision rendered against it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span
lang=EN-US>            </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>In this case, the appellant is not
    the object of the orders and thus there can be no concern that he is seeking to
    avoid the orders by bringing this action.  As a result, a threat to integrity of the system does not exist because
    the appellant is not legally bound to follow the orders.  Thus, this action does not appear, in fact,
    to be a collateral attack on the Board’s orders.</span></p>

    owing.  Absent the order, the CRA had no

    same amount against amounts additionally owed by IWS to the CRA. Those
    additional amounts are the amounts represented by the claims filed by the CRA
    in the bankruptcy.  To suggest that the Trustee
    is not challenging the jeopardy order, but only its effect, is in my view to
    ignore the reality.  In fact, this case
    is a standard example of the use of the doctrine.  As <span class=SpellE>Iacobucci</span> J.
    noted, “[g]<span class=SpellE>enerally</span>, [the doctrine of collateral
    attack] is invoked where the party is attempting to challenge the validity of a

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         Is the jeopardy order a “completely executed” order within
    the meaning of <span class=GramE>s.</span>   <span
class=GramE>70(1) of the <i>BIA</i>?</span></span></h4>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Trustee’s Position</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In essence, the Trustee argues that the jeopardy order
    is an exceptional interim measure that functions as a preservation mechanism
    pending the resolution of a taxpayer’s dispute with the CRA.  This concept is echoed throughout the general
    policy scheme of the <i>ITA</i> assessment
    process, which is not complete until objections are resolved.  Jeopardy orders are not final; they operate
    to “freeze” security or in a <span class=SpellE><i>Mareva</i></span>-like manner pending the determination of the validity
    of a tax assessment.  The fact that the CRA
    collected the funds does not alter the nature of the order itself: loss of
    possession does not automatically result in a completely executed course of
    action since it remains inextricably linked to an incomplete overall process.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The CRA’s Position</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    CRA argues that the jeopardy order is not an interim collection measure, nor is
    it a collection measure at all.  Rather,
    it is a court order authorizing the CRA to take the collection measures
    specified in s. 225.1(1) of the <i>ITA</i>.
    Under the <i>ITA</i>, a tax debt is due and
    owing to the CRA from the moment it becomes payable. Unless and until
    successfully challenged, the tax liability confirmed by the Minister by the notice
    of assessment is valid, binding and final.  Even where a notice of objection is filed, the tax assessed is still payable
    forthwith.  The characterization of a
    jeopardy order as an interim measure would render any collection action taken
    by the CRA under such an order between the time a notice of assessment is
    issued and the time any such assessment is finally adjudicated, ineffective
    against a trustee.  This is a result
    contrary to the spirit and intent of the jeopardy provision of the <i>ITA</i>.</span></p>

    my view, this argument is summarily and correctly dealt with by the motion

class=GramE>the</span> CRA’s conduct was not inconsistent with the BIA nor can
    it be said that it engaged in inequitable conduct.  Indeed it acted pursuant to a court order
    that it was entitled to seek.  Unsecured
    creditors who had similarly executed on their judgments would be treated
    similarly.  No unfair advantage has been
    conferred on the CRA.</span></p>

    agree with the motion judge.  The CRA is
    statutorily entitled to seek a jeopardy order and, upon obtaining such an
    order, to immediately collect what is owed.  There is nothing unfair about the process.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I concur with the reasons of MacFarland J.A., with one

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Trustee’s motion is not a collateral
    attack on the jeopardy order granted by the Federal Court.  In the proceeding before us, the Trustee
    fully accepts the validity of that order.  Its argument is that a valid jeopardy order coupled with provisions of
    the BIA produces, as a matter of law, the result it contends for.  I would not characterize this as a collateral
    attack on the jeopardy order.  In this
    motion the Trustee is not seeking to indirectly challenge the validity of that
    order.</p>
