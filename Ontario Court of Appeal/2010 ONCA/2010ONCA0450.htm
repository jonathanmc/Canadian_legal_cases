  <h4><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises from a rule 21.01 order to determine
    a point of law on the pleadings in relation to the claim brought by the infant
    plaintiff Kevin Liebig.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no evidentiary record and the facts are those
    alleged in the fresh as amended statement of claim, which may be briefly
    summarized as follows.  Kevin Liebig was
    born in 2001.  The other plaintiffs are
    his parents and other family members.  The
    defendants are the hospital, the physicians and the nurses who provided
    maternal-fetal care up to and including delivery.  Kevin Liebig suffered hypoxic-ischemic
    encephalopathy during childbirth resulting in cerebral palsy.  The plaintiffs allege that Kevin Liebig’s
    injuries were caused by the negligence (or breach of contract) of the
    defendants immediately before and during the delivery process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion arose following a request made by the
    plaintiffs to the defendants to admit that they owed a duty of care to the
    infant plaintiff in relation to his delivery.  The defendants refused to give an affirmative
    response to the request to admit and gave the following reason for their
    refusal: “No such duty of care exists in law”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs then moved for a declaration before
    trial, pursuant to Rule 21, that the defendants owed a duty of care to Kevin in
    relation to his delivery.  The motion
    judge reviewed the relevant case law and granted the plaintiffs the declaration
    they sought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this appeal may be properly decided on the
    basis of the very long and well-established line of cases, duly cited by the
    motion judge, holding that an infant, once born alive, may sue for damages
    sustained as a result of the negligence of health care providers during labour
    and delivery: see <i>Crawford v. Penney</i> (2003),
    14 C.C.L.T. (3d) 60 (ON S.C.) at para. 210, aff’d (2004), 26 C.C.L.T. (3d) 246
    (C.A.); <i>Commisso v. North York Branson
    Hospital</i> (2003), 48 O.R. (3d) 484 (C.A.) at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These cases follow from the general principle that “a
    child may sue in tort for injury caused before birth”, although the legal
    status to sue arises “only when the child is born” and “damages are assessed
    only as at the date of birth”: see<i> Winnipeg Child and Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G. (D.F.)</i>, [1997]<i> </i>3 S.C.R. 925 at para. 21<i>; Montreal Tramways Co. v. Léveillé, </i>[1933]
    S<i>.</i>C.R. 456; <i>Duval v. Seguin </i>(1973)<i>. </i>1
    O.R. (2d) 482 (C.A.);<i> Family Law Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 66. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the facts alleged in the present case clearly fall
    within an established category where a duty of care exists, it is not necessary
    to engage in a <i>Cooper-<span class=SpellE>Anns</span> </i>analysis: see <i>Mustapha v. Culligan</i>,
    [2008] 2 S.C.R. 114 at para. 5; <i>Hill v.
    Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 129 at
    para. 25; <i>Childs v. Desormeaux</i>,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 643 at para. 15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central point of contention before both the motion
    judge and this court arises from the defendants’ contention that two recent decisions
    of this court – <i>Bovingdon v. Hergott </i>(2008),
    88 O.R. (3d) 641 and <i>Paxton v. Ramji </i>(2008),
    299 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 614 – introduced a fundamental change to the law that
    requires us to depart from this established line of authority and to hold that Kevin
    Liebig has no cause of action against them.  The plaintiffs dispute this proposition and
    add that if <i>Bovingdon</i> and <i>Paxton</i> do go that far, they should be
    overruled. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both <i>Bovingdon</i> and <i>Paxton</i> dealt with the situation
    of a doctor prescribing drugs to a woman who was not pregnant at the time.  In <i>Bovingdon</i>,
    the drug was a fertility drug that increased the likelihood of bearing twins
    and, by extension, the risk of complications associated with the birth of twins.
     In <i>Paxton</i>,
    the drug was intended to treat the woman’s acne, but could harm a foetus if
    conception were to occur while it was being taken.  Both the doctor and the woman believed that
    the woman could not become pregnant because her husband had undergone a
    vasectomy years earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases in the vein of <i>Bovingdon</i> and <i>Paxton</i>,
    which involve claims made by infants yet to be conceived at the time the
    alleged negligence occurred, have been characterized as and rejected by other
    courts as claims for “wrongful life”: see <i>Lacroix
    (Litigation guardian of) v. Dominique </i>(2001), 202 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    121 (Man. C.A) leave to appeal denied [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 477; <i>McKay v. Essex Area Health Authority</i>,
    [1982] 1 Q.B. 1166 (Eng. C.A.).  In <i>Bovingdon</i> and <i>Paxton</i>, however, this court held that the “wrongful life” approach
    ought not to be used.  The court
    proceeded not by determining whether to recognize a claim for “wrongful life”,
    but by conducting an analysis of whether a doctor owed a separate duty of care
    to a future child.  Both <span
class=SpellE><i>Bovingdon</i></span> and <i>Paxton</i> hold that there is no duty of
    care to a future child if the alleged negligence by a health care provider took
    place prior to conception.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At various points in the <i>Paxton</i> judgment, the court cast the issue in terms of a duty of
    care to a child “not yet conceived <i>or
    born</i>” or <span style='line-height:200%'>“<i><span style='color:black'>conceived</span></i><span
style='color:black'> or not yet conceived” [emphasis added]: see paras. 53 and
    76.</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:
&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'>  </span>The
    defendants adopt a strictly literal reading of those passages and submit that <i>Paxton</i> governs the present case and
    precludes recovery for the damages arising from the alleged negligence in the
    delivery of Kevin Liebig. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not read those passages as governing the issue
    raised on this appeal.  In accordance
    with the tradition of the common law and the doctrine of precedent, <i>Paxton</i> and <i>Bovingdon</i> must be read in the light of their precise facts, the
    issues they addressed, and in a proper legal context: see Rupert Cross, <i>Precedent in English Law</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Oxford: OUP, 1968) at pp. 39-43.  In
    our view, the authority of the labour and delivery cases remains intact and is unaffected
    by <i>Bovingdon</i> and <i>Paxton</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We recognize that,<i> </i>in the future, the reasoning in<i> Bovingdon</i> and <i>Paxton</i> may be brought to bear in other
    cases involving post-conception negligence.  Indeed, in written and oral argument, counsel
    ventured opinions on a wide range of issues and possible scenarios extending
    well beyond the narrow compass of the facts of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in our view, it is neither necessary nor
    desirable for this court in this case to attempt to set out comprehensively the
    duties owed and the potential liability of heath care providers in relation to all
    manner of injuries to infants arising from negligence before birth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary as the facts of this case fall within
    the familiar and well-established category of labour and delivery cases where
    it has never been seriously questioned that negligent health care providers are
    liable.  As we can decide this case on
    the basis of this body of case law, we need not venture into less familiar
    territory or speculate as to how the law might evolve with respect to other scenarios.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is undesirable for us to do so since all that we
    have before us is a sparse record consisting only of the pleadings in what, in
    law, amounts to a routine case easily decided on the basis of a
    well-established principle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our refusal to engage in making the kind of sweeping
    statements requested by the parties does not amount to an abdication of our
    duty as an appellate court to provide the guidance required to ensure that the
    law of Ontario is administered in an orderly and consistent fashion.  Difficult cases are bound to arise in this
    area of the law.  When such cases do
    arise, the courts will be guided by certain established legal principles that have
    evolved in this contentious area of law.  We have already mentioned one of those
    principles, namely, that a child born alive may sue in tort for injury caused
    before birth. Other relevant principles were canvassed in written and oral
    argument before us, including:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“[T]<span class=GramE>he</span> law of Canada
    does not recognize the unborn child as a legal or juridical person”: <i>Winnipeg Child and Family Services</i> at
    para. 11; <i>Tremblay v. Daigle</i> [1989] 2
    S.C.R. 530 at p. 553.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The primacy of maternal autonomy concerning choices
    made regarding pre-conception and pre-natal medical treatment: <i>Winnipeg Child and Family Services </i>at
    paras. 37-39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases may well arise that do not fit neatly under any
    of the established principles and, on occasion, the established principles may appear
    to be in conflict.  This situation is characteristic
    of the common law, which does not provide a comprehensive, over-arching theory
    of liability that is capable of deciding every case or dealing with every
    possibility or contingency.  Principles
    emerge, take shape and are reconciled on the basis of fact and context-specific
    judicial decisions, aided by scholarly commentary.  A common law court should be cautious about
    laying down principles or rules that are not required to decide the case before
    it and ordinarily should limit itself to the requirements of the case at hand:
    see G. Williams, <i>Salmond on Jurisprudence</i>,
    11<sup>th</sup> ed, (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 1957), at p. 224; <i>Watkins v. Olafson</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750
    at pp. 760-61. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As we can decide this case on the basis of
    established case law, in keeping with the tradition and spirit of the common
    law, we refrain from doing any more.</p>
