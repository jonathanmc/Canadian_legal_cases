  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with sexually assaulting S.L.
    on September 16, 2006, contrary to s. 271 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  On June 27,
    2008, he was convicted by Thomas J., sitting alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has an identical twin brother, Craig
    Crangle, with whom the complainant had a consensual sexual relationship.  On September 16, 2006, the complainant was
    asleep alone in the bed in Craig Crangles bedroom in his apartment.  The appellant entered the bed.  The two had sexual intercourse, which ended
    when the complainant discovered that the man was not Craig Crangle, but his
    brother Glen Crangle, the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals this conviction.  He argues that the trial judge erred in
    finding that (i) the complainants mistake about the identity of her sexual
    partner meant she did not consent to the sexual activity; and (ii) the
    appellant did not have an honest but mistaken belief in her consent.  The appellant also challenges the sufficiency
    of the trial judges reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that all three
    arguments fail and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After separating from her husband, the complainant
    moved into an apartment in Amherstberg.  Craig Crangle lived alone in an apartment in the same building.  He and the complainant became good friends
    and eventually the relationship became intimate.  The complainant subsequently moved to
    Brampton, but returned to Amherstberg regularly to visit her children, often
    staying at Craigs apartment over the weekend.  That is what she was doing on the weekend of September 16-17, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Saturday, September 16, Craig Crangle had a party at
    his apartment.  Both his twin brother,
    the appellant, and the complainant were there.  Everyone was drinking alcohol and by midnight, the complainant indicated
    that she had consumed most of a bottle of wine and was intoxicated.  Rather than leave with the others to go to a
    bar, she went to bed in Craig Crangles bedroom and fell asleep.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some three hours later, the appellant returned to the
    apartment with the others where they continued to party.  The appellant soon became tired.  Craig told him to go sleep in his bedroom in
    order to escape the noise of the party.  When the appellant entered the darkened room, he saw that the
    complainant was already asleep in the bed.  He nonetheless got in because, although he had no significant
    relationship with her, he thought no harm would come from it since they were
    both adults and were friends. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainants evidence was that she was awakened by
    a person she presumed to be Craig Crangle, proceeding to have sex with
    her.  She protested, saying she was on
    her period.  However he persisted,
    despite her calling out Craigs name perhaps a dozen times, and entreating him
    to stop.  Her evidence was that
    throughout, he said nothing.  She began
    to be concerned, thinking it was odd that Craig was acting so out of character.  She finally managed to get him off her and
    find a light switch.  When she saw that
    it was the appellant, not his brother, she reacted with anger and disbelief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants evidence was that shortly after he
    entered the bed, the complainant initiated heavy petting which led in due course
    to sexual intercourse.  He said that at
    no point did she call out his brothers name, although at some point something
    clicked and he decided that he better make sure that she knew it was him, so he
    said: are you sure.  He said that her
    response was to guide his erect penis into her vagina.  However, he confirmed that when she turned
    the light on, her reaction was much as she described it.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGES DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reciting the evidence summarized above, the trial
    judge first addressed the <i>actus reus</i> necessary for sexual assault.  He
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Clearly the activity between Crangle and S.L., in
    the absence of consent, amounted to a sexual assault within the meaning of s.
    271.  Equally transparent to me is that
    the sex occurred without S.L.s consent.  Whatever version of events the defence chooses to argue here all lead to
    the same ultimate conclusion.  The
    complainant may have been agreeable when the activity started.  She was not agreeable at its conclusion.  Meaning she <u>may</u> have consented to sex,
    but not this sex, that is sexual intercourse with Glen Crangle.  I say that because on all versions of events
    once S.L. is able to disengage and turn on the light her reaction is one of
    disbelief and anger.  She expresses her
    view of being duped by Glen Crangle immediately.  She confirms that with Craig.  She removes herself from the apartment with
    haste and reports the incident to friends, nurses and police.  One can only see her reaction to the
    knowledge of the identity of her partner as confirmation of her lack of consent
    to sex with Glen Crangle. [Emphasis in original]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then disposed of the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And so with the belief of this legal framework and
    accepting for the purpose of this analysis that Glen Crangle thought S.L. was
    consenting to sex with him, let us look at the accepted facts as they existed
    at about 3:00 A.M. on September the 17<sup>th</sup>, 2006.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>S.L. was at the time in bed, in a darkened room,
    under the influence of alcohol and asleep.  She had an ongoing relationship with the twin brother of the accused,
    which included consensual sex from time to time and she was asleep in <u>his</u> bed.  She had never had anything that
    approached a relationship with the accused before, sexual or otherwise, and
    Glen Crangle admits that there was nothing about her conduct at the party that
    evening that caused him to imagine that she would ever consent to this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All of these facts were known to the accused
    Crangle at the time he entered the room.  We know from his own evidence that the significance of these facts are
    not lost on him even during his time in that bed because he has told us that
    before the act of intercourse, he said something just clicked and he thought
    he should be sure and so he asked Ms. S.L., Are you sure?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is significant to me that he never went further
    to make his identity perfectly clear, and never said anything else during the
    bedroom events until he was near culmination of the sex act when his phrases of
    personal gratitude finally revealed his identity to the complainant.  Even if I accept all of the evidence of Mr.
    Crangle, he should have done more.  I
    believe he knew that and chose to play it as close to the line as possible in
    an attempt to ensure that sex in fact would take place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe it is open for the court to conclude that
    the actions of Glen Crangle on the issue of consent were both reckless and
    wilfully blind and that in any event did not approach reasonable steps in the
    circumstances known to him at the time.  I come to that conclusion. [Emphasis in original]</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offence of assault is created by s. 265(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>265.</b> (1) A person commits an assault when</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>) without the consent of another person,
    he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>b</i>) he attempts or threatens, by an act or a
    gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other
    person to believe upon reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to
    effect his purpose; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>c</i>) while openly wearing or carrying a
    weapon or an imitation thereof, he accosts or impedes another person or begs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 265(2) makes the section applicable to all
    forms of assault, including sexual assault.  While nothing in s. 265 provides a definition of consent, s. 265(3),
    which is applicable to all forms of assault, sets out circumstances in which
    the defence of consent is not available:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is
    obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>) the application of force to the
    complainant or to a person other than the complainant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>b</i>) threats or fear of the application of
    force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>c</i>) fraud; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>d</i>) the exercise of authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 273.1 speaks specifically to sexual
    assault.  Section 273.1(1) sets out a
    definition of consent in the context of this form of assault, and s. 273.1(2)
    provides a non-exclusive list of circumstances in which the defence of consent
    to sexual assault cannot be raised:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="codese:273_1"></a><span
style='"codese\:273_1"'><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>273.1</span></span> (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), consent means,
    for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, the voluntary agreement of the
    complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) No
    consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a
    person other than the complainant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>b</i>) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>c</i>) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity
    by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>d</i>) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of
    agreement to engage in the activity; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>e</i>) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual
    activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to
    engage in the activity.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)
    Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in
    which no consent is obtained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To establish the <i>actus
    reus</i> of sexual assault, the Crown must prove three elements: (i) touching; (ii)
    the sexual nature of the contact; and (iii) the absence of consent.  See <i>R.
    v. Ewanchuk</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330 at para. 25.  The first two elements are not in issue in
    this case.  However, the appellant argues
    that the complainants mistake as to the identity of her sexual partner was
    insufficient to vitiate her consent to the sexual activity.  He says that the offence could only have been
    made out if it was found that the appellant committed fraud so as to vitiate
    that consent pursuant to s. 265(3)(c) of the <i>Code</i>.  In essence, the
    appellant argues that unless the complainants mistake of identity was caused
    by his fraud, the Crown cannot establish the absence of consent.  Since the trial judge made no finding of
    fraud by the appellant, the appellant argues that the appeal must be allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this argument fails.  The analysis of the presence or absence of
    consent in this case must begin with the definition provided by s. 273.1(1) of
    the <i>Code</i>, which defines consent to
    mean the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
    activity in question.  It is the absence
    of consent defined in this way that the Crown was obliged to prove.  In other words, the Crown had to establish
    that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the sexual activity that took
    place that night.  In <i>Ewanchuk</i>,<i> </i>the Supreme Court of Canada made clear that the absence of consent
    must be assessed only on the basis of the complainants subjective state of
    mind towards the sexual activity in question and that assessment must be as of
    the time the activity occurred.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The absence of consent, however, is subjective and
    determined by reference to the complainants subjective internal state of mind
    towards the touching, at the time it occurred:&nbsp; see<b> </b><i>R. v. Jensen</i> (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 430 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 437-38, affd [1997] 1 S.C.R.
    304, <i>R. v. Park</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at p. 850, <i>per</i> LHeureux-Dubé J., and D. Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law</i> (3rd ed. 1995),
    at p. 513.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:7.0pt'> </span>Confusion has arisen from time to time
    on the meaning of consent as an element of the <i>actus reus</i> of sexual
    assault.&nbsp; Some of this confusion has been caused by the word consent
    itself.&nbsp; A number of commentators have observed that the notion of consent
    connotes active behaviour:&nbsp; see, for example, N. Brett, Sexual Offenses
    and Consent <a name=reflex-caselaw-53711569></a>(1998), 11 <i>Can. J. Law
    &amp; Jur.</i> 69, at p. 73.&nbsp; While this may be true in the general use of
    the word, for the purposes of determining the absence of consent as an element
    of the <i>actus reus</i>, the actual state of mind of the complainant is
    determinative.&nbsp; At this point, the trier of fact is only concerned with
    the complainants perspective.&nbsp; The approach is purely subjective.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rationale underlying the criminalization of
    assault explains this. Society is committed to protecting the personal
    integrity, both physical and psychological, of every individual. Having control
    over who touches ones body, and how, lies at the core of human dignity and
    autonomy.&nbsp; The inclusion of assault and sexual assault in the <i>Code</i> expresses societys determination to protect the security of the person from
    any non-consensual contact or threats of force.&nbsp; The common law has
    recognized for centuries that the individuals right to physical integrity is a
    fundamental principle, every mans person being sacred, and no other having a
    right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner:&nbsp; see Blackstones <i>Commentaries
    on the Laws of England</i> (4th ed. 1770), Book III, at p. 120.&nbsp; It
    follows that any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is what the trial judge did here.  The evidence was clear that the complainant
    had an ongoing consensual sexual relationship with Craig Crangle, but had
    nothing approaching the same with the appellant.  It was also clear that the sexual activity in
    question was the appellants sexual intercourse with her that night.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the evidence, the trial judge concluded that
    while in the beginning the complainant may have been agreeable to the activity
    because she thought it was with Craig Crangle, at no time did she consent to
    sexual intercourse with the appellant.  Thus, at no time did she voluntarily agree to the sexual activity in question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not only are these findings well grounded in the
    evidence, in my view, they are entirely reasonable.  In the beginning, the complainant mistakenly
    thought the sexual activity was with someone with whom she had an ongoing
    consensual sexual relationship.  Such a
    relationship is a deeply personal one in which the identity of the sexual
    partner is fundamental.  It is hardly
    surprising that, from the complainants perspective that night, the identity of
    her sexual partner was an inseparable component of any consent to sexual
    activity.  Subjectively, she did not
    voluntarily agree to sexual intercourse with anyone other than Craig
    Crangle.  That included the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the offence of sexual assault
    could only have been made out if it was found that he had committed fraud so as
    to vitiate the complainants consent pursuant to s. 265(3)(c) of the <i>Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is certainly true that this subsection provides that
    fraud can vitiate consent for sexual assault, as for all other forms of
    assault.  Moreover, in <i>R. v. Cuerrrier</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371,
    the Supreme Court of Canada decided that one form of fraud that can be found to
    vitiate consent is fraud pertaining to the identity of the partner.  It also made clear however, that fraud was not
    limited to this, but included fraud pertaining to the nature and quality of the
    act, or to other acts of dishonesty that on a principled basis can be shown to
    vitiate consent.  In other words, the
    purpose of s. 265(1)(c) encompasses more than fraud pertaining to
    identity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, there is nothing in the language of
    s. 265(1)(c) or the jurisprudence to suggest that only a mistake as to the
    identity of the sexual partner that is induced by fraud vitiates consent. Moreover,
    the appellant suggests no policy reason why an identity mistake caused by
    something else will not do.  Indeed s.
    273.1 suggests the opposite.  It does not
    confine consent to voluntary agreement except where that is negated by an
    identity mistake due to fraud.  Where the
    subjective state of mind of the complainant is that her consent hinged on the
    identity of her sexual partner, her mistake about that identity renders his
    conduct non-consensual, whether or not the mistake is induced by fraud.  The presence or absence of fraud may however
    be significant to whether the Crown can prove that the accused did not have an
    honest belief that the complainant was consenting.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where, as here, the complainants consent to sexual
    activity depended on it being with a particular person, her mistake about the
    identity of that person whether induced by fraud or not, necessarily means that
    subjectively she did not voluntarily agree to the sexual activity that occurred
    with someone else.  That is precisely
    what the trial judge found happened in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, I would dismiss the appellants argument
    and conclude that the trial judge did not err in finding that the Crown
    successfully proved the absence of consent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants second argument is that even if the
    absence of consent was established, the trial judge erred in his analysis of
    the defence of mistaken belief.  The
    appellant argues that the trial judge held the appellant to a standard higher
    than taking reasonable steps to ascertain consent and made no finding that the
    appellants mistaken belief was due to his recklessness or wilful blindness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 273.2 describes the circumstances in which an
    accused cannot rely on his belief that the complainant consented to the
    activity as a defence to a charge of sexual assault.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>WHERE BELIEF
    IN CONSENT NOT A DEFENCE.</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section
    271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the
    activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the accuseds belief arose from the accuseds            </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (i) self-induced intoxication, or                                             </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (ii)
    recklessness or wilful blindness; or                               </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) the accused did not take reasonable
    steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that
    the complainant was consenting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dealt first with whether the appellant
    took reasonable steps in the circumstances known to him at the time to
    ascertain that the complainant was consenting.  He found that the appellants actions  did not approach reasonable
    steps in the circumstances known to him at the time.  The trial judge did not require that the
    appellant take <u>all</u> reasonable steps.  I therefore disagree with the appellants assertion that the trial judge
    required him to do anything more than s. 273.2(b) requires.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence makes clear that what is required of
    an accused in the way of reasonable steps depends on the particular
    circumstances of the case, and can be more or less, depending on those
    circumstances, even to the point of requiring an unequivocal indication of
    consent from the complainant at the time of the sexual acitivity.  As the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    explained in <i>R. v. R.G.</i> (1994), 38 C.
    R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 123 at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, that does not conclude the matter, for s.
    273.2(b) clearly creates a proportionate relationship between what will be
    required in the way of reasonable steps by an accused to ascertain that the
    complainant was consenting and the circumstances known to him at the
    time.  Those circumstances will be as
    many and as varied as the cases in which the issue can arise, and it seems to
    me that the section clearly contemplates that there may be cases in which they
    are such that nothing short of an unequivocal indication of consent from the
    complainant, at the time of the alleged offence, will suffice to meet the
    threshold test which it establishes as a prerequisite to a defence of honest
    but mistaken belief.  On reading his
    reasons for judgment as a whole, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
    intended to say anything more than that this was one such case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that, in the circumstances of
    this case, reasonable steps required the appellant to make his identity
    perfectly clear to the complainant.  That
    conclusion was amply justified on these facts.  The appellant knew the complainant had an ongoing consensual sexual
    relationship with his twin brother, but nothing remotely like that with
    him.  He knew she had gone asleep
    intoxicated in his brothers bed, as she had done many times before.  The bedroom was pitch dark.  Nothing about her conduct that night caused
    him to think that she would ever consent to sexual intercourse with him.  The trial judges conclusion that reasonable
    steps required the appellant to do more than he did and make his identity perfectly
    clear to the complainant is fully supported by this evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it was enough for the trial judge to find that
    any one of the disqualifying circumstances in s. 273.2 existed here, he went on
    to conclude that the facts also supported the conclusion that the complainants
    absence of resistance arose because the appellant proceeded with recklessness
    and wilful blindness.  The trial judge
    made clear that in coming to that conclusion, he understood the distinction
    between the two concepts as described in <i>R.
    v. Sansregret</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 510.  He applied that legal test correctly.  Here too, the evidence amply sustained his conclusion that for the
    appellant to forge ahead in the circumstances was reckless or at the very least
    displayed a wilful blindness about whether the complainant consented.  There is no basis for us to interfere.  The appellants second argument therefore
    fails.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants third argument is that the reasons of
    the trial judge in rejecting the defence of mistaken belief in consent, failed
    to meet the standard required by <i>R. v.
    Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once again, I do not agree.  The trial judge explicitly found that the
    complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse with the appellant and
    described in detail the findings of fact on which that conclusion rested.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then considered the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief, accepting for the purpose of his analysis that the appellant thought
    the complainant was consenting.  The
    trial judge recited the relevant facts of that night known to the appellant and
    concluded that without doing more than he did to make his identity perfectly
    clear to the complainant, the appellant could not be said to have taken
    reasonable steps necessary to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.  Moreover, in proceeding, he was reckless and
    wilfully blind.  The path that the trial
    judge followed to reject this defence is clearly marked, is based on facts well
    established by the evidence, and is ample for appellate scrutiny.  This argument fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal from conviction must be
    dismissed.</p>
