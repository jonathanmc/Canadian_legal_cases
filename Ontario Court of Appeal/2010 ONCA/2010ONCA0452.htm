    Roy, Jasmine Shawanda and Amsay Osawamick lived in a two-floor apartment in the
    Bayheights east area of </span>Wikwemikong.  Late in the evening of April 16, 2006, Mr. Roy and Ms. Shawanda were at
    home watching television.  Ms. Osawamick
    was away from the apartment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Roy answered a knock at the apartment
    door.  Four men, all wearing dark
    clothing, pushed their way into the apartment. Among the intruders were the
    appellants and Christopher Cooper.  The
    fourth person was never identified.  Two
    of the men, including the appellant Jacko, wore bandanas covering most of their
    faces. The appellant Manitowabi was not masked, but wore the hood of his
    sweatshirt pulled over his head.</p>

    apartment.  The men punched and kicked Mr.
    Roy in the head and ribs. One man pushed Mr. Roy’s head through the drywall
    and, at the direction of the other intruder, took his watch and necklace. The blows
    rained on Mr. Roy caused him injury.</span></p>

    force to Mr. Roy’s head and ribs.  Jacko
    also pushed Mr. Roy’s head through the drywall and took his necklace and watch.
    Mr. Roy valued the property taken at $150 to $250.  Although Jacko wore two bandanas that covered
    most of his face, Ms. Shawanda recognized him.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US><b>The Circumstances of the Offenders</b></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The
    Appellant Lance Jacko</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacko is now 23 years old. He committed the offences
    that are the subject of this appeal on the day before his 19<sup>th</sup> birthday.
    His several convictions as a young person include both assault and aggravated
    assault, possession of property obtained by crime and four entries for breach
    of a recognizance.  Each disposition
    included terms of probation, although the conviction of aggravated assault also
    attracted a term of deferred custody and supervision. Several weeks after he
    committed the current offences, Jacko was convicted of two counts of breach of
    probation.  These convictions, his first
    as an adult, resulted in another term of probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacko is a lifelong resident of Wikwemikong, one of two
    siblings from a longstanding common law relationship. His father was a police
    officer. The relationship between Jacko’s parents was abusive, dominated by
    assaults and excessive alcohol consumption. The appellant suffered excessive
    physical discipline at home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacko struggled at school, in part because other
    students bullied him.  He fought
    back.  He began to use illicit
    drugs.  He drank alcohol to excess.  A follower by nature, he fell in with a
    dysfunctional group.  He came into
    contact with the law, and left high school. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The events of April 16, 2006, proved an epiphany for
    Jacko.  He returned to high school,
    completed his final year with Honours and received an award for proficiency in
    Ojibwe, his native language.  He stopped
    using drugs and drinking alcohol.  He got
    a job and worked hard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in 2006, Jacko began a relationship with Wahss
    Wabano, a young woman of similar age whom he had met in high school.  The couple lived together at Ms. Wabano’s
    family home, a stable and nurturing environment for both of them.  They now have two young children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s father died in September 2007, after a
    five-year battle with Alzheimer’s disease.  The appellant spent a great deal of time with his father in the final
    months of his father’s life. He remains a constant source of support for his
    mother, a devoted father to his children and a dedicated worker for his
    employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacko was accepted for admission at community college
    in a carpentry and building program. His common law partner applied for
    admission to a nursing program. According to the fresh evidence filed without
    objection on appeal, Jacko is now a fulltime student at Canadore College in
    North Bay, has achieved considerable academic success and should graduate from
    his program in August 2010.  His common
    law partner is enrolled in a nursing program at the same college.  They live together with their two young
    children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A sentencing circle, which included relatives of two of
    the victims of Jacko’s offences, but lacked any input from law enforcement or
    prosecution sources, supported a sentence to be served in the community,
    subject to several conditions.</p>
  <h3>The Appellant Sebastian Manitowabi</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manitowabi was 18 years old when he committed the
    offences and is now 22.  After his
    parents separated when he was three years old, he was raised by his mother and
    maternal grandmother.  During his
    formative years, Manitowabi suffered the unexpected loss of a cousin in a motor
    vehicle accident.  His grandmother, with
    whom the appellant was especially close, died in 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manitowabi was a rebellious youth who was bullied by
    his schoolmates.  He never completed high
    school and, despite being told that he needed to advance his educational
    qualifications in order to improve his employment prospects, he has done nothing
    to further his education.  Likewise, he
    has not undertaken any treatment or participated in any counselling for
    substance abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manitowabi has previous convictions for break, enter
    and commit an indictable offence, possession of stolen property and assault.  He was also convicted of robbery and disguise
    with intent in connection with an incident that took place after April 16,
    2006, but for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment that he served
    before the sentence under appeal was imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since his conviction, Manitowabi has become more
    interested in the traditional way of life and expressed an interest in
    beginning anew in British Columbia with relatives of his family.  He remains a high risk to re-offend because
    he has never come to grips with his abuse of drugs and alcohol, lacks both
    academic and vocational qualifications to obtain gainful employment, and has
    committed offences of increasing severity as he has become older.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing circle convened to consider a
    disposition for Manitowabi also recommended that he not be incarcerated, rather
    that he serve his sentence in the community, subject to certain
    conditions.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties at Trial</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel representing the appellants at trial and
    counsel for their co-accused, Christopher Cooper, each sought conditional
    sentences of two years less one day. The prosecutor sought mid-range
    penitentiary terms of four to seven years for Manitowabi and a more lengthy term,
    of five to ten years, for Jacko.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Reasons of the
    Trial Judge</b> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were convicted on April 21, 2008, and
    sentenced about 11 months later on March 24, 2009.  In the interim, both a <i>Gladue Report</i> and <i>Pre-Sentence
    Report</i> had been prepared for each appellant.  The trial judge also had the benefit of <i>viva voce</i> evidence, several letters
    attesting to the appellants’ character, victim impact statements from two
    victims and lengthy submissions from trial counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acknowledged the need to consider the
    aboriginal background of each appellant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[29]     Since
    these accused are of an aboriginal background, consideration must be given to
    any systemic and background factors that may have affected these individuals
    and if so, then a restorative approach may be considered.  And I am citing as authority the <i>R. v. Gladue</i> case [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688
    and <i>R. v. Wells</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R.
    207.  And also the more recent decisions
    by the Court of Appeal of Ontario in <i>R.
    v. Kakekagamick </i>(2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 664 and <i>R. v. Whiskeyjack, </i>[2008] O.J. 4755.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After noting that, in determining an appropriate
    sentence, a sentencing judge must consider increasing or reducing a sentence as
    a result of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the trial judge
    underscored the seriousness of “home invasion” crimes and addressed the
    aggravating and mitigating factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[37]     In
    this case the aggravating factors are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(1)       All
    three have significant criminal records involving violence.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(2)       They
    broke into a private dwelling.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(3)       There
    was planning and premeditation of the offence.  All four individuals attended at the same time and all four wore
    disguises and all four were looking for money or other valuable assets.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(4)       Violence
    was involved. Lance Jacko thrust Orien Roy’s head through the wall and then he
    and Cooper proceeded to strike Orien repeatedly in the face and in the stomach.  Christopher Cooper grabbed Jasmine Shawanda
    and placed a knife to her throat.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(5)       These
    incidents have had a traumatic impact on both Jasmine Shawanda and Amsay
    Osawamick in that both remain angry and fearful and feel that they have been
    violated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[38]     The
    mitigating factors on behalf of the accused are the rehabilitation efforts
    undertaken by them, and in particular, by Lance Jacko and their young ages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[39]     As
    stated previously since this offence, Lance Jacko has completed high school and
    has found employment and may have turned his life around.  With respect to Christopher Cooper, he has
    remained in custody and has undertaken counselling. Sebastian Manitowabi has
    not been in any further problems since his release from prison in January 2008
    and has found occasional seasonal employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acknowledged that rehabilitation was a
    significant factor influencing his sentencing decision, but he considered
    protection of the public, denunciation and deterrence to be of paramount
    importance.  The trial judge emphasized
    the importance of general deterrence. The offences were “planned and
    premeditated” and crime was prevalent in the Wikwemikong community. It was
    doubtful whether Manitowabi, or the co-accused Christopher Cooper, would be
    deterred from committing further violent crimes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the imposition of a
    conditional sentence would be inconsistent with the fundamental purpose and
    applicable principles of sentencing.  The
    offences committed were premeditated, violent and serious, thus attenuating the
    influence of <i>Gladue </i>factors and
    favouring sentences similar to those for non-aboriginal offenders.  The range of sentence appropriate for home
    invasion cases warranted sentences beyond dispositions that could be served in the
    community.  The sentencing objectives of
    denunciation and general deterrence could not be met by imposition of a
    conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the recommendations of the
    sentencing circles. The prosecutor and judge were not present.  No one advanced the position of the
    prosecutor or apprised circle members of the prior convictions of each
    appellant. The recommendations lacked specifics, especially regarding
    enforcement and control mechanisms.  The
    trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[55]  These
    were serious, violent, senseless offences, which took place in the privacy of
    the victims’ home, where they were entitled and are entitled to expect a
    feeling of security.  This is especially
    so in smaller communities where generally everyone knows each other. Here, the
    offences were perpetuated by three individuals, actually four but three were
    found, who could be considered neighbours and were known to each other either
    through their community or by having attended school together. The victims feel
    that they have been violated in their own home by people that they knew. The
    citizens of Wikwemikong and of Manitoulin Island, and in fact anywhere, should
    not live in fear that someone will invade them in their own homes. In addition,
    the accused committed these offences to support their addictions.</p>

  <h3> The Positions of the
    Parties on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each appellant alleged that several errors tainted the
    trial judge’s sentencing decision, including, but not only, errors relating to the
    application of the provisions of s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and implementation of the principles mandated by <i>R. v. Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.</p>
  <h3>The Position of the Appellant Lance Jacko</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For Jacko, Mr. Weppler submits that the trial judge
    failed to properly apply the analysis required by s. 718.2(e) and under <i>Gladue</i> in relation to serious violent
    offences. The trial judge appears to have held the view that in cases of
    serious violent offences, the sentences imposed on aboriginal offenders, like
    Jacko, must be the same as those imposed on similarly situated non-aboriginal
    offenders.  According to Mr. Weppler,
    such a conclusion does not follow from either <i>Gladue</i> or any of its progeny.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Weppler says that the trial judge gave inadequate,
    if any weight to restorative justice principles.  He unfairly cast aside the recommendations of
    the sentencing circle and failed to give effect to the principle of restraint
    as it is described in <i>Gladue</i>.  More to the point, the trial judge imposed a
    sentence driven exclusively by denunciation and deterrence despite the
    remarkable, if not unique rehabilitative measures undertaken by Jacko and
    advice from the community about the harmful effects of incarceration in distant
    jails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Position of the Appellant Sebastian Manitowabi</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For Manitowabi, Mr. Thompson submits that the trial
    judge erred in treating the appellant’s conviction for a similar offence
    committed <i>after</i> the offences under
    appeal as part of Manitowabi’s prior record for sentencing purposes.  In the result, Mr. Thompson continues, the
    trial judge regarded Manitowabi as an incorrigible recidivist worthy of a
    denunciatory sentence.  The trial judge
    should have recognized that the deterrent effect of the prior custodial
    sentence rendered unnecessary a further sentence dominated by the same
    sentencing objective.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Thompson further contends that the trial judge
    erred in treating the lower end of the sentencing guidelines for home invasion
    sentences as a mandatory minimum sentence from which no departure was
    permissible. Such a determination effectively precluded a conditional sentence.
      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In common with Mr. Weppler for Jacko, Mr. Thompson says
    that the trial judge failed to take proper account of the aboriginal heritage
    of the appellant, as well the perspective of the aboriginal community in
    reaching his sentencing decision. No principled reason existed to refuse a
    conditional sentence. </p>
  <h3>The
    Position of the Respondent</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent affirms the fitness of the sentences
    imposed on both appellants.  According to
    the respondent, there was no error in principle and no failure to consider a relevant
    or irrelevant factor.  There was no
    overemphasis of appropriate factors, and nothing demonstrably unfit about the
    sentences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the respondent, Ms. Roberts submits that the trial
    judge properly considered Jacko’s aboriginal status as required by <i>Gladue</i> and s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The offences were serious
    and violent. The predominant sentencing objectives, for aboriginal and
    non-aboriginal recidivists alike, are denunciation and deterrence. The trial
    judge gave appropriate weight to the recommendations of the sentencing circle
    that were vague, barren of specifics and based on erroneous and incomplete
    information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Roberts says that the trial judge was right in not
    imposing a sentence on Jacko that could be served conditionally. A penitentiary
    sentence was appropriate despite Jacko’s rehabilitative progress.  The offences were planned and took place
    while the apartment was occupied.  The
    perpetrators wore disguises.  A weapon
    was produced and held at the throat of one of the victims.  Jacko inflicted violence on one of the
    occupants, causing him injuries and damaging a wall in the apartment. Jacko is
    a youthful recidivist who received a sentence within the appropriate range, and
    the sentence should not be disturbed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Barrett takes the position that the sentence
    imposed on Manitowabi is untainted by error and sits comfortably towards the
    lower end of the range of fit sentences for Manitowabi and his offences.  The trial judge considered the proper sentencing
    objectives, assigned them appropriate weight and applied the proper methodology
    in considering the effect of Manitowabi’s aboriginal status and modest
    rehabilitative efforts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Barrett says that the trial judge did not err in
    the use he made of the appellant’s 2007 related convictions.  He was well aware that those offences took
    place <i>after</i> those upon which
    Manitowabi was to be sentenced. Similarly, the trial judge properly treated the
    sentencing guidelines for home invasion cases as a tariff, rather than a
    statutory minimum, and was correct in his application of the <i>Gladue</i> methodology and restorative
    justice principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Ms. Barrett, the trial judge did not err
    in rejecting the recommendations of the sentencing circle. He was entitled to
    weigh those recommendations and assign limited weight to them in light of their
    myriad weaknesses.  These offences,
    committed by a youthful recidivist, warranted penitentiary sentences.  A conditional sentence order and a
    reformatory sentence are inconsistent with the governing principles and would
    not protect the community from Manitowabi’s demonstrated recidivistic
    tendencies.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have concentrated their claims of
    unfitness on four discrete yet related grounds:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          failure to assign appropriate effect
    to the circumstances of each            appellant
    as an aboriginal offender and to apply the teachings of <i>Gladue</i>; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         overemphasis on the sentencing
    objectives of denunciation and             deterrence
    and inadequate attention to the ameliorating influence of       the objectives of restorative justice;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       treatment of sentencing ranges as the
    equivalent of minimum     sentences, thereby
    indirectly eliminating the availability of     conditional
    sentences; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.        failure to allot sufficient importance
    to the considered   recommendations of the
    sentencing circles in determining the         sentences
    to be imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To avoid unprincipled substitution of appellate
    hindsight for first instance experience, the discussion of governing principles
    can begin with a gentle self-reminder of the limits of appellate
    intervention.  </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The Governing
    Principles </h3>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The
    Standard of Review</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the expansive language of the mandate awarded us
    by s. 687(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    absent an error in principle, a failure to consider a relevant factor, an
    overemphasis of the appropriate factors or the imposition of a sentence that is
    demonstrably unfit, we are disentitled to intervene to vary a sentence imposed
    at first instance: <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i>,
    [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90; <i>R. v.
    M. (L.)</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By nature, sentencing is profoundly contextual, a
    delicate exercise requiring a fine balance of competing, if not antagonistic
    objectives, principles, and factors. The inherently individualized nature of
    the sentencing process, as well the significant advantage of the sentencing
    judge, especially in cases where, as here, sentence is imposed after trial,
    rather than on a plea of guilty, fully justifies a deference-based standard of
    review: <i>M. (C.A.)</i> at para. 91; <i>M. (L.) </i>at para. 15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This deferential standard disentitles this court to
    vary a sentence simply because all or a majority of us would have imposed a
    different sentence at first instance: <i>M.
    (L.)</i> at para. 14. We must also keep a weather eye on the reality that
    sentences for particular crimes vary, to some degree, across communities and
    regions in our province. The “just and appropriate” mix of accepted sentencing
    objectives, principles and factors depends upon and is a function of the needs
    and current conditions of and in the particular community where the offender
    committed the offence.  All the more
    reason for appellate deference: <i>M. (C.A.)</i> at para. 92.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The
    Fundamental Purpose of Sentencing</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 718 of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>describes the fundamental purpose of sentencing persons convicted of
    crime.  That purpose is to contribute,
    along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the
    maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions on
    offenders. Among the sentencing objectives that underlie the sentencing
    decision are:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>denunciation</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>reparation for harm done</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>promotion of offender responsibility</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>acknowledgement of harm</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Sentencing objectives such as the
    last four listed above, demonstrate the influence of restorative justice
    components in the sentencing decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Restorative objectives are of particular importance in
    determining the sentence to impose on youthful offenders, including immature
    recidivists.  Restorative justice, which
    underpins ss. 718(d)-(f), involves some form of restitution and reintegration
    into the community. Central to the sentencing process is the need for offenders
    to take responsibility for and acknowledge the harm caused by their conduct: <i>Gladue</i> at para. 43.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>The
    Fundamental Principle of Sentencing</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The fundamental
    principle of sentencing, codified in s. 718.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, is that the sentence must be proportionate to the
    gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
    Inherent in this fundamental principle is a legislative recognition and
    acknowledgement that sentencing is an individualized process, ill-suited to a “one-size-fits-all”
    approach.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some measure of the objective gravity of a crime is its
    maximum punishment as prescribed by Parliament.  In some instances, Parliament has also provided a minimum punishment for
    an offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Degrees of responsibility vary.  Some are principals.  Others are aiders, abettors, counsellors or parties
    to a common unlawful purpose. And<span lang=EN-US> even within each mode of participation, some bear greater
    responsibility than others.  Although all
    are parties in law and equally guilty of the offence, greater punishment is the
    usual consequence of greater responsibility.</span></p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>Other Sentencing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament has included several other sentencing
    principles in Part XXIII of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>,<i> </i>and directed sentencing
    judges to take these principles into account in determining what sentence to
    impose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar offenders who commit similar offences in
    similar circumstances should receive similar sentences, according to s.
    718.2(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This principle does <i>not </i>command identical sentences for co-accused, only similar
    sentences for co-accused whose participation in the offences is similar and who
    have similar antecedents, present circumstances and future prospects.  Disparity of sentences among co-accused is
    not <i>per</i> <i>se</i> error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another sentencing principle, evident from the
    introductory portion of s. 718.2(a), is that a sentence should be <i>reduced</i> to take into account any
    mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or offender, or increased to
    account for any aggravating circumstances, including those deemed to be
    aggravating in ss. 718.2(a)(i) to 718.2(a)(v) and described as aggravating in
    relation to a listed offence in s. 348.1. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite its references to the role of mitigating
    circumstances in decreasing a sentence, neither s. 718.2 nor any other <i>Criminal Code </i>provision contains a
    definitive or an illustrative list of mitigating circumstances.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%'>Section 718.2(e)
    and <i>Gladue</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its face, s. 718.2(e) requires a sentencing judge to
    consider alternatives to the use of imprisonment as a penal sanction. This
    sentencing factor embodies the principle of restraint and is of general
    application. Except in cases in which no other sanction or combination of
    sanctions is appropriate to the offence and offender, imprisonment is a penal
    sanction of last resort: <i>Gladue </i>at
    para. 36.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The juxtaposition of a specific reference to aboriginal
    offenders in the waning words of s. 718.2(e) signals to sentencing judges that
    they must pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders
    because they, or their circumstances, are unique and different from those of
    non-aboriginal offenders.  Section
    718.2(e) imposes a duty on the sentencing judge to give the remedial purpose of
    the provision real force in relation to aboriginal offenders: <i>Gladue </i>at paras. 34 and 38.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 718.2(e) alters the method of analysis a
    sentencing judge must undertake in their determination of a fit sentence for an
    aboriginal offender. The sentencing determination must take into account the
    unique circumstances of aboriginal peoples: <i>Gladue </i>at para. 75.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <i>Gladue</i> teaches, it is important to recognize that, for many, if not the vast majority
    of aboriginal offenders, our current sentencing concepts do not resonate.  Frequently, those concepts have not responded
    to the needs, experiences and perspectives of aboriginal people or aboriginal
    communities: <i>Gladue</i> at para. 73.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appropriateness of a sentence depends on the
    particular circumstances of the offence, the offender and the community in
    which the offender committed the offence.  Predictably, this individualized focus in sentencing decisions spawns
    disparity among sentences for similar crimes: <i>Gladue</i> at para. 76; <i>M. (C.A.)</i> at para. 92. The “just and appropriate” mix of sentencing objectives,
    principles and factors will depend on the needs and current conditions of and
    in the community in which the offence was committed: <i>M. (C.A.)</i> at para. 92.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another lesson from <i>Gladue</i> is that an aboriginal community will often understand the nature of the just
    sanction in a manner that differs markedly from non-aboriginal communities. <i>Gladue</i> acknowledges that, in appropriate
    cases, some traditional sentencing objectives will be correspondingly less
    relevant to the sentencing decision and the objectives of restorative justice
    will occupy a place of greater influence:  <i>Gladue</i> at para. 77.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Restorative justice objectives do not trump other
    sentencing objectives in every case involving aboriginal offenders. Separation,
    denunciation and deterrence retain their fundamental relevance for some
    offenders who commit serious offences.  As a general rule, the more serious and violent an offence, the more
    likely it is that the terms of imprisonment imposed on similarly-circumstanced
    aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders will not differ significantly, and indeed
    may be the same.  That said, in some
    instances of serious and violent crime, the length of a sentence of an
    aboriginal offender may be less than that imposed on a non-aboriginal offender: <i>Gladue</i> at paras. 79 and 80.  Serious crime and the objectives of
    restorative justice are not incompatibles in the sentencing process –
    restorative justice objectives may predominate in the sentencing decision for
    aboriginal offenders convicted of serious crimes: <i>R. v. Wells</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, at para. 49; <i>R. v. Whiskeyjack </i>(2008), 93 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), at para. 29.</p>
  <h3>The
    Availability of Conditional Sentences</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ claim for conditional sentences of
    imprisonment warrants a brief examination of the statutory requirements and
    principles governing the imposition of conditional sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellants were sentenced, the trial judge was
    required to consider several criteria in deciding whether to impose a
    conditional sentence.  Were any of the
    offences punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment?  Was a sentence of less than two years fit and
    appropriate?  Would the safety of the
    community be endangered if the appellants served their sentence in the
    community? Was a conditional sentence consistent with the fundamental purpose
    and principles of sentencing in ss. 718 to 718.2?: <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 at para. 46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine whether a sentence of imprisonment of less
    than two years in length is fit and appropriate, a sentencing judge must make a
    preliminary determination to exclude probation and a penitentiary term as
    sentencing options. This preliminary determination requires the judge to
    consider the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing in ss. 718 to
    718.2, including, in the case of aboriginal offenders, s. 718.2(e): <i>Proulx</i> at para. 60.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To assess the risk of endangerment of community safety,
    a sentencing judge should take into account both the risk of re-offending and
    the gravity of the harm that could ensue in the event of recidivism.  The risk of recidivism must be assessed in
    light of the conditions proposed and the supervision available under the
    conditional sentence order: <i>Proulx</i> at
    para. 72.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A conditional sentence is available in principle,
    though not always in practise, for all offences in which the statutory
    prerequisites are met.  Apart from
    offences excluded by the terms of s. 742.1, for example offences punishable by
    a minimum term of imprisonment, no specific or category of offence is
    presumptively excluded from the conditional sentence option: <i>Proulx</i> at paras. 79 – 81.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 718.2(e), like other sentencing principles,
    exerts an influence on the sentencing judge’s determination about whether to impose
    a conditional sentence or a jail term: <i>Proulx </i>at para. 95; <i>Wells</i> at para. 30.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Depending on the severity of the conditions imposed, a
    conditional sentence may nonetheless be reasonable even where denunciation and
    deterrence are the predominant sentencing objectives: <i>Wells </i>at para. 35. A conditional sentence can achieve both punitive
    and restorative sentencing objectives.  As Lamer C.J. explained in para. 100 of <i>Proulx</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To the extent that both punitive and restorative
    objectives can be achieved in a given case, a conditional sentence is likely a
    better sanction than incarceration. Where the need for punishment is
    particularly pressing, and there is little opportunity to achieve any
    restorative objectives, incarceration will likely be the more attractive
    sanction.  However, even where
    restorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will
    be preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can
    achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as effectively as
    incarceration.  This follows from the
    principle of restraint in s. 718.2(<i>d</i>)
    and (<i>e</i>), which militates in favour of
    alternatives to incarceration where appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A conditional sentence with house arrest carries a
    substantial stigma for the offender, especially in a smaller, tightly-knit
    community where everybody knows everybody else and their business.  The nature and extent of denunciation
    achieved by a conditional sentence will vary significantly, depending upon the
    circumstances of the offender, the nature of the conditions imposed, the
    community in which the sentence will be served and the knowledge of the
    offender’s crime within that community: <i>Proulx </i>at para. 106.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aboriginal status does <i>not</i> guarantee a conditional sentence.  It is, nonetheless, an important factor for
    the sentencing judge to consider in determining whether to impose a conditional
    sentence: <i>Wells </i>at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Principles Applied</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is time to return to the sentencing decision to
    determine whether, as the appellants contend, it reflects error to such an
    extent that appellate intervention is justified.  In the event of reviewable error, we are
    required to determine a fit sentence.  </p>
  <h3>Was There a Reviewable Error?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was confronted with a very difficult
    sentencing decision, one that required a delicate balancing of competing if not
    antagonistic sentencing objectives, principles and factors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On one hand, the appellants’ offences were serious,
    involving the invasion of an occupied home in a small community by a small band
    of youthful recidivists. Property was taken and damaged.  Occupants were assaulted, injured and
    threatened.  One of the invaders, not an
    appellant, used a weapon. The intruders, save one, were masked.  Their conduct was purposeful and bespoke
    prior agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, unique among the youthful
    recidivists who committed these offences, Jacko had undertaken and persevered
    with remarkable rehabilitative steps to make reparations for the harm caused by
    his crimes, to take responsibility for his conduct and to reduce the risk of
    his future recidivism.  Further, the
    community in which these appellants reside and in which they committed their
    crimes against other residents and their property adheres to notions of what constitutes
    just punishment that differ from much of society and assign prominence to
    objectives of restorative justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A combination of factors satisfies me that, despite the
    well-entrenched and richly-deserved deference due to sentencing decisions of
    trial judges, the sentences imposed on both appellants are infected by error
    that require our intervention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge failed to accord sufficient
    weight to the appellants’ aboriginal heritage and, more generally, to the
    sentencing objective of restorative justice. For example, the trial judge does
    not appear to have considered the impact of the provisions of s. 718.2(e) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> on his preliminary
    determination of whether a penitentiary sentence could be excluded from the
    available sentencing options.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge appears to have excluded the
    availability of a conditional sentence of imprisonment on the basis that the
    paramount sentencing objectives were deterrence and denunciation.  It is well-settled that the prominence of
    these sentencing objectives does <i>not</i>,
    on its own, foreclose a conditional sentence order as a sentencing alternative,
    since a properly crafted conditional sentence can give full voice to both
    objectives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, in my view, the trial judge failed to give
    sufficient weight to the nature of the community in which these offences were
    committed and the views of that community (as reflected in the recommendation
    of the sentencing circle) about the nature of punishment best suited to respond
    to the community’s needs and notions of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And finally, the trial judge appears to have treated
    the range of sentence discussed in <i>R. v.
    Wright</i> (2006), 216 C.C.C. (3d) 54 (Ont. C.A.) as imposing a <i>de facto</i> minimum sentence for these
    offences, despite the prosecutor’s apparent acknowledgement of the adequacy of
    a two-year sentence. To consider guidelines as constituting a <i>de facto</i> minimum sentence is
    inconsistent with the fundamental principle<i> </i>of proportionality, and amounts to either judicial creation of a category
    of excluded offences or a presumption that conditional sentences are
    inappropriate for certain offences.  Both
    are wrong.</p>
  <h3>What is a Fit Sentence for Each Appellant?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a fit sentence for each appellant, in the
    singular circumstances of these appeals, is a sentence of imprisonment at the
    upper end of the reformatory range, thus making a conditional sentence of
    imprisonment available in law if appropriate in all the circumstances.  I will explain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin with an acknowledgement of the obvious, the
    offences the appellants committed were serious.  A planned entry, looting and robbery.  Facial disguises, except for Manitowabi, albeit inadequate to their task
    of preventing identification. Physical violence and threats.  Use of a weapon.  And knowledge or at least recklessness that
    the premises, a home, was occupied at the time of the forced entry. The
    sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence were destined to occupy
    positions of prominence in the sentencing decision.  No controversy there. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But denunciation and deterrence are <i>not </i>the only sentencing objectives at
    work here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Restorative justice sentencing objectives are of
    crucial importance in the circumstances. They include assistance in
    rehabilitation, providing reparations for harm done to the victims and to the
    community, promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders and an
    acknowledgement by offenders about the harm their conduct has done to the
    victims and to their community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cases such as these, we must do more than simply
    acknowledge restorative justice sentencing objectives and note approvingly the
    rehabilitative efforts of those convicted.  They must have some tangible impact on the length, nature and venue of
    the sentence imposed.  The rehabilitative
    efforts here, more specifically those of Jacko, extend well beyond the promises
    made all too frequently between conviction and sentence, and all too
    infrequently executed and maintained in the days, weeks and months following
    imposition of a lenient sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time sentence was imposed, Jacko had remedied
    his educational deficiencies, purged his addictions, jettisoned his antisocial
    lifestyle, abandoned his confederates and taken on spousal and parenting
    responsibilities.  The passage of time
    since sentencing confirms the legitimacy of his efforts. College
    admission.  Employment.  Spousal and child support.  Community involvement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, while our decision in <i>Wright</i> and cases following its lead describe a range of sentence
    for “home invasion” cases, it is clear from <i>Wright</i> itself that these cases require an especially nuanced approach to sentencing
    that involves a careful examination of the circumstances of the case at hand,
    of the nature and severity of the offenders’ conduct and the circumstances of
    each offender involved in the offences: <i>Wright</i> at para. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentencing “ranges”, such as that described in <i>Wright</i>, are not immovable or
    immutable.  They are and represent
    guidelines, of greater or lesser utility depending upon the breadth of the
    range.  Individual cases may fall within
    or outside the range.  To consider a
    range of sentence as creating a <i>de facto </i>minimum
    sentence misses the point, ignores the fundamental principle of proportionality
    and is not faithful to the teachings of <i>Wright</i> itself.  Individual circumstances
    matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, that sentences for serious or violent offences
    should approach or be equivalent for aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders is
    a rule of general, but not universal or unremitting application:  <i>Wells </i>at
    para. 50.  As in every sentencing
    decision, sentencing aboriginal offenders proceeds on an individual basis. The
    analysis is, as it must be, holistic, designed to achieve a fit sentence in the
    circumstances, the elusive fundamental principle of proportionality: <i>Gladue</i> at paras. 80–81. Equipped with
    s.&nbsp;718.2(e), sentencing courts are furnished a substantial measure of
    flexibility and discretion that permits the consideration in appropriate circumstances,
    of alternative sentences to incarceration that are at once apposite for the
    aboriginal offender and community and congruent with the governing purpose,
    objectives and principles of sentencing: <i>Gladue</i> at para. 81.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the sentencing objective of restorative justice
    may be assigned greatest weight in the sentencing determination despite the
    seriousness of an offender’s crime: <i>Wells </i>at paras. 49–50.  This case involves
    significant restorative justice considerations fully developed in the <i>Gladue</i> <i>Report </i>and the recommendations of the sentencing circle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, sentencing is an inherently individualized
    process. Sentences can be expected to and do vary to some degree across various
    communities. The just and appropriate mix of sentencing objectives, the
    application of the fundamental principle of proportionality depends on the
    needs and current conditions of and in the particular location where the crime
    occurred.  It is all the more so where
    the community has offered its input to the sentencing court: <i>M. (C.A.) </i>at para. 92; <i>Gladue </i>at paras. 76-77.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seventh, depending on its terms, a conditional sentence
    order can deliver significant measures of denunciation and deterrence: <i>Proulx</i> at para. 100; <i>Wells</i> at para. 35.  Incarceration may provide for more
    denunciation and deterrence than a conditional sentence.  But, at least as a general rule, a
    conditional sentence is more tailored to accomplishing the restorative
    objectives of rehabilitation, reparation and promotion of a sense of
    responsibility in the offender: <i>Proulx</i> at para. 109.  Of greater importance,
    when, as here, the objectives of rehabilitation, reparation and promotion of a
    sense of responsibility may realistically be realized for a particular offender,
    a conditional sentence is likely the appropriate sanction, provided
    denunciation and deterrence considerations are adequately serviced by the
    sentence: <i>Proulx</i> at para. 109.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a conditional sentence is appropriate for
    Jacko in this case, but not for Manitowabi.  </p>
  <h3>Duration, Venue and Terms of the Sentences</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a sentence at the upper end of the
    reformatory range accords proper weight to the principal sentencing objectives
    at work in this case: denunciation, deterrence and restorative justice.  Such a term also pays heed to the relevant
    sentencing principles, as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors at
    work in the case of each appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The length of sentence that I consider appropriate in
    this case falls outside the range of sentence described in <i>Wright</i>, but as the <i>Wright</i> court itself makes plain, the range of sentence described there is a guideline,
    of general service, not of universal application.  Exceptions exist. This case demonstrates one
    of them.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal drivers of the range of sentence
    described in <i>Wright</i> are the
    sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation.  No restorative justice objectives were at
    work in <i>Wright</i>, unlike here where
    their influence is profound, at least in the case of Jacko.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the roles of the appellants
    to be of equivalent gravity and reflect the same degree of responsibility.  I agree.  Neither appellant was the ringleader, but each was an active
    participant.  Their conduct
    differed.  Jacko, along with another, the
    prime mover, Christopher Cooper, assaulted Mr. Roy. Manitowabi stole property
    and vandalized the premises.  Jacko’s
    facial features were disguised, though not apparently well. Manitowabi was
    unmasked. And all the participants were known to one another.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To take Jacko first.  In my view, an appropriate sentence for Lance Jacko is a sentence of
    imprisonment of two years less one day to be served in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacko, who is now 23 years old, is currently enrolled
    as a full-time student at Canadore College in North Bay. His partner attends
    the same college where she pursues another program.  Jacko expects to graduate this year, work for
    the next two years while his partner finishes her course, and pursue further
    education.  He is sober, a responsible
    father to two young children and has been persistent and consistent in his
    self-rehabilitation since his release from custody. He poses no danger to his
    community or to any identifiable segment of that community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The terms and conditions included in the conditional
    sentence order for Lance Jacko are these:</p>

    either persistent or consistent in his efforts at self-rehabilitation. He has
    not pursued further education, despite advice of the necessity for it in order
    to enhance his opportunities for employment.  He has undertaken some counselling for abuse of illicit drugs, but seems
    little motivated in its consistent pursuit. His employment history reveals
    intermittent seasonal jobs and no attempt to follow any course apt to develop
