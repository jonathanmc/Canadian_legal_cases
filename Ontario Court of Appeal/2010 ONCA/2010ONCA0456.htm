  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chartrand</span>,
    owed a mortgage debt of approximately $237,474.75 to the appellant, Canadian
    Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), including $37,000 for back taxes which CIBC
    paid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) had a claim for unpaid
    GST in the amount of $175,000 for which it claimed a super priority by virtue
    of s. 222(1) of the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985<b>, </b><span class=GramE>c</span>.
    E-15<b>,</b> over the CIBC mortgage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CIBC brought an application for a bankruptcy order
    against Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chartrand</span>. The issue on this appeal is
    whether CIBC satisfied the requirements of ss. 43(1) and (2) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, <span
lang=EN>R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3, s. 1; 1992, c. 27,
    s. 2., (the <i>BIA</i>)</span> which state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. 43(1) Subject to this section, one or more
    creditors may file in court an application for a bankruptcy order against a
    debtor if it is alleged in the application that</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> debt or debts
    owing to the applicant creditor or creditors amount to one thousand dollars;
    and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) <span class=GramE>the</span> debtor has
    committed an act of bankruptcy within the six months preceding the filing of
    the application,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>if</span> applicant creditor is a
    secured creditor. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span lang=EN> If
    the applicant creditor referred to in subsection (1) is a secured creditor,
    they shall in their application either state that they are willing to give up
    their security for the benefit of the creditors, in the event of a bankruptcy
    order being made against the debtor, or give an estimate of the value of the
    applicant creditor’s security, and in the latter case they may be admitted as
    an applicant creditor to the extent of the balance of the debt due to them
    after deducting the value so estimated, in the same manner as if they were an
    unsecured creditor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as CIBC did not wish to give up its security
    entirely, it had to give an estimate of the value of the security.  For CIBC’s application to succeed, the
    unsecured portion of its claim had to exceed $1,000.  In addition, it had to prove that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Chartrand</span> had committed an act of bankruptcy within the six
    months preceding the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its application dated March 5, 2008, CIBC estimated
    the value of its mortgage security to be $200,000, thus asserting that there
    was an unsecured balance owing of approximately $37,000.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chartrand</span> disputed CIBC’s application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, CIBC submitted two appraisal reports.  The first dated March 6, 2007 valued the property
    at <span class=GramE>between $209,000 to $225,000</span>; the second dated
    January 23, 2008 at $230,000.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Chartrand</span>, who represented himself, testified that the
    value of the property was $275,000.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Application Judge’s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that the evidence that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Chartrand</span> had committed an act of bankruptcy and was unable
    to pay his debts generally as they came due within the six months that preceded
    the application was overwhelming. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was also satisfied that there was no merit in Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Chartrand’s</span> allegation that the application was brought for
    an improper purpose.  If CIBC’s
    application was granted, then, by virtue of the provisions of the <i>BIA</i> respecting distribution,<span
lang=EN> the priorities between itself and the CRA
    would be reversed.  The application judge</span> held, in accordance with <i>Re <span
class=SpellE>Ivaco</span> Inc., </i>(2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 108 (C.A.), that this
    was a legitimate reason to bring the application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge dismissed CIBC’s application on
    the basis that he was not satisfied it had shown it had at least $1,000 of
    unsecured indebtedness.  In so doing, the
    application judge was alive to the fact that the <i>BIA</i> did not require the applicant to provide an independent
    appraisal and that it need only provide an estimate which must establish that
    its valuation was not a sham or absurdly low.  Although the appraisal reports were hearsay,
    they could be considered for the purpose of determining that the estimate of
    value was made in good faith and was not a sham or absurdly low.  See <i>Re
    C. <span class=SpellE>Tokmakjian</span> Ltd.</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 4667 (S.C.)
    at para. 41.  The application judge,
    however, distinguished <span class=SpellE><i>Tokmakjian</i></span><i> </i>from the situation before him.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Tokmakjian</i></span><i>,</i> the
    applicant’s account manager testified about efforts made to sell the security
    and gave evidence that these efforts had resulted in few offers and those that
    were received were low because the market was poor.  In the instant case, CIBC had chosen not to
    offer any evidence in this regard.  It
    had filed its application after just receiving the last appraisal valuing the
    property at $230,000, yet it had chosen to estimate the value at $200,000
    without explanation.  Thus, the
    application judge held that the estimate was absurdly low, that he could not
    find on the evidence that the estimate was made in good faith, and that CIBC had
    not established that the value of the property was at least $1,000 less than
    the debt owed by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chartrand</span>. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Argument on Appeal and Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the very narrow margin between the
    debt claimed and the appraisals, combined with CIBC’s omission to adduce any
    evidence of valuation, the application judge’s decision in favour of the
    unrepresented Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chartrand</span> is certainly
    understandable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this appeal, CIBC submits that the application judge
    made a palpable and overriding error in concluding that it failed to establish
    at least $1,000 of unsecured debt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CIBC makes two submissions in support of its
    argument.  The first is that a valuation
    of $200,000 was not absurdly low.  The
    appraisal of $230,000 did not take into consideration that property taxes in
    the approximate amount of $32,500 were owed.  Thus, this amount should have been subtracted
    from the appraised value.  The second is
    that, as CIBC’s mortgage ranked behind CRA’s claim for GST in the amount of
    $175,000 on the date of the application, there was in excess of $100,000 of
    unsecured debt owing to CIBC at that time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CIBC’s affidavit in support of its application valued
    its security at $100,000.  Based on the
    argument CIBC now makes before us, the affidavit overvalued the amount of CIBC’s
    secured debt by at least $100,000 to its detriment.  It therefore appears that CIBC’s submissions
    may not have been made to the application judge.  In addition, had this been the case, it is
    likely the application judge would have addressed them in otherwise
    comprehensive reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that the date for valuing CIBC’s security is
    the date of the application and that, taking into consideration the amount of
    the debt owing to the CRA and its priority, CIBC was an unsecured creditor.  The relevant time for determining whether an
    act of bankruptcy has occurred is the date of the application.  See <i>The
    2010 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, Lloyd W. Houlden, Geoffrey B.
    Morawetz &amp; Janis P. <span class=SpellE>Sarra</span> at p. 148 and cases
    cited therein.  It only makes sense that
    that date is also the relevant date for determining the value of the security. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other jurisprudence also supports our conclusion that
    the application should succeed.  The
    decision of <i>Fred Walls &amp; Son Holdings
    Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1999] 13 C.B.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 60 appeal dismissed on
    procedural grounds at [2003] 40 C.B.R.(4<sup>th</sup>) 171 holds that the
    relevant date for valuing a security is both the date of the application and
    the date that the </p>
</div>
<br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always;'>
<div class=Section2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE>application</span> is heard.  Payments made to reduce
    indebtedness to the applicant creditor after the date of the application and
    before the date of the hearing would thus be taken into consideration in
    determining the amount of unsecured debt.  Here, there were none.  I also note that in <i>A.E.S. Empire Inc.,</i> [1989] 77 C. B.R. (N.S.) 33 (Ont. S.C.),<i> </i>Saunders J. dealt with a situation in
    which the applicant creditor was owed approximately $300,000.  It alleged its security was worth only
    $250,000 although the property in issue had been sold to the debtor in an arm’s
    length transaction a few months earlier in the same year for $351,000.  The applicant creditor had not had the
    property appraised and there was no evidence of valuation from any person
    qualified to give such evidence.  Saunders J. held, however, that the valuation was not a sham.  The debt owing was certain, and, having
    regard to the evidence of second <span class=SpellE>mortgagees</span>, it was
    apparent there was a problem of unsecured indebtedness.  In these circumstances, he held that a court
    ought to grant the petition rather than exercise its discretion to grant a
    stay.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the decision of the application
    judge is set aside, the appeal is allowed and the application is granted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the fact that the submissions now
    advanced on appeal were submissions that ought to have been made at first
    instance, we would order that there be no costs at first instance.  Costs of this appeal are to the appellant and
    are fixed in the amount of $9,000, all inclusive.</p>
