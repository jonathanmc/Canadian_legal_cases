  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the judgment of Borkovich J.
    wherein he ordered that the respondent was to have judgment against the
    appellant in the sum of $107,732.79 in damages for Income Replacement Benefits
    (“IRBs”), plus $438,268.65 in prejudgment interest in accordance with s. 68 of
    the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule
    – Accidents After December 31, 1993 and Before November 1, 1996</i>, O. Reg.
    776/93 (the “<i>SABS</i>”).  Further, although not discussed in the
    reasons, the trial judge also found that the appellant was required to continue
    to pay ongoing weekly benefits until such time as the appellant provided a proper
    notice of termination of benefits and a proper disability Designated Assessment
    Centre (“DAC”) assessment was conducted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent cross-appeals and seeks to overturn the
    trial judge’s finding that  as of the
    fall of 1998, the respondent no longer continued to suffer a substantial
    inability to perform the essential tasks of her employment.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent suffered injuries in a motor vehicle
    accident on May 18, 1996.  The record
    discloses that her injuries were of a physical and psychological nature.  The appellant paid the respondent IRBs until
    September 1997, when it terminated her benefits.  The notice of termination sent to the
    plaintiff was a standard form prescribed by the Commissioner of Insurance [now
    the “Superintendent”] and was identical in form to the one considered in the
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Smith
    v. Co-operators General Insurance Co., </i>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 129.  In <i>Smith</i>,
    the majority of the Supreme Court held that the notice of termination form did
    not comply with s. 71 of the <i>SABS</i> because it did not inform the claimant of the entire dispute resolution process
    set out in the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. I.8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge, after referring to <i>Smith,</i> concluded at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    12 to 14:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Likewise, in this lawsuit, the notices to terminate
    weekly benefits are invalid and therefore Allstate has improperly terminated
    the plaintiff’s weekly benefit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 64(13) SABS as it applies to the
    circumstances of this law suit sets out as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>…, and, if it is finally determined that the
    benefits should not have been stopped, the insurer shall,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       <span
class=GramE>resume</span> payment of the benefits; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       <span
class=GramE>pay</span> the benefits that were not paid.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I therefore conclude that the plaintiff is entitled
    to the payment of weekly benefits to the date hereof and the continuation of
    weekly benefits in the amount of $356.00 hereafter.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge’s reliance on <i>Smith</i> was misplaced. <i>Smith </i>was concerned with the
    applicability of the two-year limitation period in the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  The
    legislation required that a claimant bring an action against an insurer “within
    two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the benefit claimed or within such
    longer period as may be provided in the [<i>SABS</i>].”
    The <i>SABS</i> provided that where an
    insurer refused to pay a benefit, the insurer had to inform the claimant in
    writing of the procedure in the <i>Insurance
    Act</i> for resolving disputes relating to benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Smith</i>, the
    insured had been in a motor vehicle accident on April 14, 1994.  She claimed and received statutory benefits
    from her insurer who ceased paying those benefits on May 8, 1996, by letter of
    that same date.  The insured was unable
    to persuade the insurer to reinstate her benefits and proceeded to the required
    mediation on August 11, 1997, which failed.  The insured issued a statement of claim for ongoing statutory benefits on
    September 8, 1998.  The insurer moved for
    summary judgment to dismiss her claim on the basis that her claim had been
    issued more than two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the benefit claimed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the court found that the form sent by
    the insurer to notify the insured of the refusal to pay her IRBs was inadequate
    as it did not satisfy the requirement in the <i>SABS</i>.  It did not inform the
    insured of the dispute resolution process in the <i>Insurance Act</i>, which provided how an insured who disagreed with the
    decision to terminate benefits could challenge that decision. The court
    determined that without certain basic information on the dispute resolution
    process, it could not be said that a valid refusal had been given. Since the
    limitation period only begins to run upon a refusal, the limitation period was
    not triggered and the insured’s action could continue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, however, at para. 1 of the reasons
    Gonthier J. noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here was no proper refusal made and the
    limitation period did not begin to run. The appellant is not barred from
    bringing her action. <i>However, I make no
    conclusion about the merits of her claim, which a trial judge must assess. </i>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inadequate notice did not automatically entitle the
    insured to payment of benefits.  She was
    still required, as the court acknowledged, to prove her claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That same reasoning applies to the facts of this
    case.  The inadequacy of the refusal
    notice did not entitle the respondent to payment of benefits in perpetuity
    until proper notice was given or a proper DAC assessment was carried out.  The respondent was still required to prove
    that she was entitled to the continued payment of IRBs because of her continued
    substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of her employment.  Moreover in this case no question of an
    expired limitation period arises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evidence before him the trial judge found that
    at the time the appellant gave the respondent notice of termination of her IRBs,
    her  physical injuries had resolved to
    the point where she could resume a graduated return to her full-time employment.
     Her inability to perform her employment
    at that time was largely due to her psychological injuries. He further found that
    by August 1998 she was no longer depressed so that as of the fall of 1998 she
    no longer continued to suffer a substantial inability to perform the essential
    tasks of her employment at the restaurant, and had recovered from all her
    injuries related to the motor vehicle accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings are amply supported on the
    evidence before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also argued that because the doctor who
    performed the DAC assessment was only authorized to assess musculoskeletal,
    brain and spinal cord impairments and not psychological or psychiatric impairments,
    the DAC assessment was invalid.  The
    trial judge agreed and found that the process was flawed and the respondent was
    entitled to continue to receive weekly benefits until a proper DAC assessment was
    conducted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the doctor who performed the DAC assessment had
    the necessary academic and professional qualifications to conduct both physical
    and psychological assessments, he was only authorized under the DAC process to
    perform assessments of musculoskeletal, brain and spinal cord impairments.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  While the DAC process was flawed as the
    result of this lack of authorization, this procedural flaw did not entitle the
    respondent to ongoing disability benefits unless she was entitled to those
    benefits under the statute – i.e., unable to substantially perform the
    essential tasks of her employment.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>QUANTUM OF BENEFITS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the reasons of the trial judge that
    demonstrate how he came to the conclusion that the amount of weekly benefit
    payable to the respondent was $356.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position is that the amount of weekly
    benefit payable is $234.23, which is based on the respondent’s actual
    employment earnings during the four-week period preceding the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant section of the <i>SABS</i> in force at the time reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>GROSS ANNUAL
    INCOME</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            9.
    (1) For the purpose of determining the amount of a person’s weekly income
    replacement benefit under paragraph 1 or 2 of subsection 7(1), the person’s
    gross annual income from employment shall be deemed to be the following amount:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.  In
    the case of a person who designated the four weeks before the accident under
    paragraph 1 of subsection 7(2), the person’s gross income from employment for
    the four weeks before the accident, multiplied by thirteen.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (2)       For the purpose of subsection (1), a
    person who,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote> (a)       <span
class=GramE>is</span> entitled to weekly income replacement benefits under
    paragraph 1 of subsection 7(1);</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote> (b)       <span
class=GramE>designated</span> the four weeks before the accident under
    paragraph 1 of subsection 7(2); and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>           (c)        <span
class=GramE>started</span> the employment in which he or she was engaged at the
    time of the accident during the four weeks before the accident,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>may elect that the person’s gross income from
    employment for the four weeks before the accident be deemed to be the amount
    determined by taking the person’s gross income from employment for the part of
    the four-week period for which the person earned income from the employment in
    which he or she was engaged at the time of the accident and extrapolating it
    over the rest of the four-week period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position is that having been
    continuously employed at the Village Inn Steak House &amp; Dining Lounge (the “Village
    Inn”) in the four-week period prior to the accident, and having chosen such
    four-week period for the calculation of the weekly benefit, it is s. 9(1)1 of
    the <i>SABS</i> that ought to apply.  Using her actual employment income for the
    four-week period yields a benefit of $234.23 per week.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If one applies s. 9(2) of the <i>SABS</i>, it is argued, the benefit would be $356.00 per week; however,
    the appellant submits that s. 9(2) is only available where the respondent had
    changed jobs during the four-week period prior to the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record discloses that the respondent began to work
    at the Village Inn in December 1995 on a part-time basis. She worked about 15
    hours per week and was paid $10 per hour less deductions.  She mostly did the books, although when
    required she would help out the owner in the kitchen or with other aspects of
    the business including the day-to-day administration of the office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About two and one-half weeks before the accident, the
    respondent became a full-time employee of the restaurant.  She was doing all the things she did before
    but now on a full-time basis, working Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to
    4:30 p.m. or 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  This
    change resulted in an obvious increase in her income that, if she were
    permitted to take into account in the calculation of her IRBs, would result in
    a greater weekly benefit payment to her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the respondent did not “[start]
    the employment in which she was engaged at the time of the accident during the
    four weeks before the accident”.  Rather,
    she started that employment in December 1995.  Her job remained unchanged and her employer remained unchanged.  All that changed was the number of hours
    worked and her status as a part-time or full-time employee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the respondent started full-time employment in
    the two and one-half weeks prior to the accident.  The question remains whether that change
    alone is sufficient to bring the respondent within the language of s. 9(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) – “started the employment in which he or she was
    engaged at the time of the accident during the four weeks before the accident”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the change is sufficient.  The appellant has not pointed to anything elsewhere
    in the legislation that suggests the legislature intended by this section to
    reference only changes in the actual nature of the employment or employer.  Indeed, common sense would suggest the
    contrary.  If, for example, the respondent
    had left the Village Inn and started a new job with a different employer doing
    the same kind of work she had at the Village Inn, there is no doubt she would have
    been covered and able to qualify for IRBs using s. 9(2).  Similarly, if she had gone from an
    entry-level employee at a hotel earning $10 per hour to the manager at the same
    hotel earning $150,000 per year, she would qualify under s. 9(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obvious purpose of s. 9(2) is to afford to persons
    who have started new employment with higher wages immediately before being
    injured in an accident, access to IRBs at a higher rate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that at the time this particular
    regime was in place in Ontario, injured claimants were unable to bring claims
    in tort for economic loss. To make up for this loss, accident benefits were
    more generous than they had been under prior regimes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had the legislature intended a more restrictive
    interpretation, it could and would have chosen clear language to signal that
    intention.  It did not do so.  In my view, the language is sufficiently
    broad to cover the respondent<span lang=EN-US>’s
    situation and she should be paid benefits during the period of her entitlement
    accordingly.</span></p>
