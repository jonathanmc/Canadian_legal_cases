  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a lawyer, appeals from a finding of
    criminal contempt.  That finding arose
    out of a submission the appellant made on behalf of her client, Jean-Claude
    Côté, in a sentencing proceeding.  At the
    contempt hearing, which was presided over by the judge who had sentenced the
    appellant’s client, the appellant acknowledged that a submission she had made
    with respect to credit for pre-sentence custody had misled the judge into believing
    that her client was not in custody on any other matter.  Her client was in fact serving a two-year
    sentence imposed about a week earlier in Québec.  As the judge was unaware that the client was
    serving a sentence, he did not indicate that any part of the 12-month sentence
    he imposed should run consecutively to any other sentence.  Consequently, part of the sentence was
    interpreted by the correctional authorities as running concurrent to the Québec
    sentence, resulting in a different and lesser sentence than the judge had
    intended.  The judge later amended the
    warrant of committal to indicate that the entire 12-month sentence was
    consecutive to the Québec sentence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the contempt hearing, the appellant argued that she
    had not intended to mislead the sentencing judge and that her inadvertently
    misleading statement concerning credit for pre-sentence custody was a product
    of her inexperience and lack of expertise in criminal law matters.  The appellant offered a written, unqualified
    apology for having unintentionally misled the judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the contempt proceedings, the judge
    rejected both the appellant’s explanation for her misstatement and her apology.  He concluded that some of the factual
    assertions made in the appellant’s explanation were unbelievable.  The judge made a finding of criminal contempt
    and imposed a fine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal.  The judge’s reasons demonstrate that he proceeded
    on the basis that the appellant, having made a misleading submission that
    caused the judge to impose a sentence other than the intended sentence, was
    guilty of criminal contempt unless she could “purge” or “negate” that contempt
    by offering an adequate explanation or apology.  The judge erred in presuming criminal contempt upon a finding of the
    requisite <i>actus reus</i>, and in placing
    a burden on the appellant to demonstrate that her conduct was not
    contemptuous.  The judge should have
    considered the entirety of the record, including the appellant’s explanation for
    her misstatement and her unqualified apology, before deciding whether he was
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the appellant made the misleading
    statement, she had the necessary <i>mens rea</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that, had the requisite <i>mens rea</i> for criminal contempt been
    properly addressed, there would have been no reasonable basis upon which the judge
    could have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant acted
    with the necessary <i>mens rea</i>.  I would quash the conviction and enter an
    acquittal.</p>

  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was called to the bar in February 2000
    and was employed by an Ottawa law firm beginning in November 2001.  Eighty per cent of her practice involved
    civil litigation, 10 per cent involved family litigation, and 10 per cent
    involved criminal litigation.  The
    appellant is bilingual and most of the criminal work she received at the law
    firm was because the client was a Francophone or the disclosure was in
    French.  As of the contempt proceedings
    in 2007, the appellant had conducted three criminal trials and about 15 to 20
    guilty pleas.  Three or four of her cases
    involved clients that were in custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant returned to her employment with the law
    firm from maternity leave on October 16, 2006.  On that same day, another lawyer in the firm instructed her to appear on
    behalf of one of his clients to enter a guilty plea on October 20, 2006.  The appellant was told that a plea agreement
    had been arranged and that there would be a joint submission on sentence.  The lawyer told the appellant that there
    would be a pre-trial on October 18, 2006.  He did not give her any further information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant attended the judicial pre-trial on
    October 18, 2006.  The Crown confirmed
    that the matter would proceed on October 20, 2006 by way of a guilty plea with
    a joint submission that the client should receive a sentence of 12 months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant went to the cells to meet her client before
    court on October 20, 2006.  She wanted to
    get to know him a little bit before sentencing.  As the appellant was about to leave the cell, the client asked her if it
    was true that a sentence would be concurrent to any other sentence being served
    unless the judge said that the sentence was “consecutive” when he imposed it.  The client told her that he had pled guilty
    to certain charges in Québec the prior week and had received a two-year
    sentence.  The client had a long criminal
    record and was no doubt quite familiar with the operation of the criminal
    justice system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant told the client that she did not know
    whether the sentence would be concurrent or consecutive if the judge said
    nothing when he imposed sentence.  She said
    she would try to find out the answer to his question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before going into court, the appellant spoke to a
    colleague who told her that a sentence would be concurrent if the word
    “consecutive” was not mentioned by the judge when the sentence was imposed.  Her colleague also told her that, in her
    opinion, the appellant had no obligation to disclose the client’s recent conviction
    and sentence to the Crown or to the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not tell the Crown or the court at
    the sentencing hearing that her client had been sentenced to a two-year jail
    term the prior week in Québec.  For the
    purposes of this appeal, it is important to understand that it was never
    alleged that the appellant’s failure to advise the court of the Québec sentence
    constituted a contempt of court.  Rather,
    it is common ground that the question whether the appellant was ethically
    obliged to advise the Crown or the court of the Québec sentence is a matter on
    which there could be reasonable disagreement.  As the appellant’s failure to advise the court of the Québec sentence
    was not the basis upon which the contempt allegation proceeded, and the issue
    was not canvassed in argument, it would be inappropriate for this court to
    comment on the appellant’s ethical duties upon being advised of the Québec
    sentence by her client.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of very brief submissions on sentence,
    the appellant said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This matter was pre-tried with Ms. Meloche and
    Justice Alder and we – it is a joint submission.  <u>We would ask that he gets time served.  He’s been in custody since September 20<sup>th</sup> – so that’s thirty-one days – with a 12-month custody, deducting the time
    served, and two years probation with certain conditions.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, Crown counsel made equally brief
    submissions during which he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[J]ust a couple of clarifications.  One is with respect to the sentence, at least
    my note – <u>and I’ve indicated this to my friend – is that it’s 12 months from
    today, not 12 months less the dead time.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant made no submissions in response.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge imposed a sentence of eight months on the
    charge of uttering a threat and a consecutive sentence of four months on the
    charge of unlawfully entering a dwelling house with two years probation to
    follow.  He indicated that the 31 days of
    pre-sentence custody could be reflected on the first count on the warrant of
    committal.  In imposing a total sentence
    of 12 months, the judge intended that the client would serve a 12-month
    sentence.   He, of course, did not know
    that the client had received a two-year jail term a week earlier.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2007, about seven months after the sentences
    were imposed, the Crown received a letter from Correctional Services Canada
    advising that the client had been serving a two-year sentence on the Québec
    charges at the time he was sentenced in Ontario.  Correctional Services requested clarification
    as to whether the sentences were to be served concurrently or consecutively to
    the Québec sentence.  Correctional
    Services interpreted the eight-month sentence imposed by the judge on the
    threatening charge as concurrent to the two-year Québec sentence and the
    four-month sentence imposed on the other charge as consecutive to that
    sentence, resulting in the net increase of four months imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When notified of Correctional Services’ concerns, the Crown
    brought an application before the judge to amend the warrant of committal to
    make it clear that the entire 12 months was to be served consecutively to the
    Québec sentence.  The appellant’s law
    firm was served with notice of the application, but declined to respond on the
    basis that it no longer represented the client.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge conducted a hearing, determined that he was
    not <i>functus</i> and that he had not
    intended that any part of the sentence run concurrently to any other
    sentence.  The judge amended the warrant
    of committal to make it clear that the sentences he imposed were to run
    consecutively to the Québec sentence.  During
    this proceeding, the judge decided that the appellant should be cited for contempt.  Appropriate notices were given and the
    contempt proceedings followed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contempt hearing took place in December 2007.  The appellant, through counsel, provided a lengthy
    letter of explanation and apology to the court.  In the letter, she acknowledged her inexperience in criminal law matters
    and her faulty understanding of certain aspects of the sentencing process.  The appellant also admitted that she was not
    adequately prepared for the sentencing hearing.  She denied, however, that she had acted dishonestly or had ever intended
    to deceive the court.  The appellant
    accepted that her unintentional misstatement concerning pre-sentence custody
    had in fact misled the judge.  She
    offered an unequivocal apology.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, counsel for the appellant advised the
    court that the appellant would take the stand and reiterate her explanation and
    apology if the judge thought it appropriate.  The judge did not pursue counsel’s invitation.  Nor did the Crown request an opportunity to
    cross-examine the appellant on her explanation and apology.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were many issues canvassed at the contempt
    hearing, including the appellant’s competence, inexperience, the adequacy of
    her firm’s supervision of her practice, and the remedial steps that might be
    taken to improve the appellant’s competence.  However, as the judge observed, the crux of the contempt allegation
    centred on the appellant’s submission that her client should get credit for 31
    days pre-sentence custody.  While there
    were other failings in the appellant’s representations on sentence, including a
    misdescription of her client’s criminal record, those failings were not relied
    on to support the contempt finding.  The
    appellant’s liability on the contempt charge turned on her state of mind when
    she made the submission asking for credit for pre-sentence custody.  She could only be convicted if, when she made
    that submission, she had the <i>mens rea</i> necessary for contempt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two problems with the appellant’s submission
    that her client should get credit for 31 days pre-sentence custody.  First, under the terms of the plea agreement,
    the sentence was to be 12 months from the date of imposition without any credit
    for pre-sentence custody.  Second, the
    appellant’s submission that her client should get credit for pre-sentence
    custody implied that her client was not in custody on any other matter;
    otherwise, he would not have been entitled to full credit for the 31 days.  By implying that the client was not in
    custody on any other matter, the appellant’s submission caused the court to assume
    that the client was not in custody on any other matter and to not make any
    inquiries about the need to indicate that the 12-month sentence should be served
    consecutive to any other sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant’s counsel on the contempt proceedings
    addressed both difficulties flowing from the appellant’s submissions concerning
    credit for pre-sentence custody.  He
    acknowledged that the submission was contrary to the terms of the plea
    agreement.  Counsel submitted, however,
    that in making her submission, the appellant had not intended to repudiate or
    contradict the plea agreement, but was simply ignorant of its specific terms
    when she made the submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel’s submission is borne out by the transcript of
    the sentencing proceedings.  Immediately
    after the appellant made reference to credit for pre-sentence custody, counsel for
    the Crown, after speaking with the appellant off the record, advised the judge
    that under the terms of the plea agreement there was to be no credit for pre-sentence
    custody.  The appellant said nothing to
    suggest that Crown counsel’s correction was inaccurate and the sentencing proceeded
    accordingly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing sinister can be read into the appellant’s
    misstatement of one of the terms of the plea agreement.  She knew next to nothing about the agreement,
    and was aware of the terms only to the extent that they were discussed in the
    brief judicial pre-trial a few days earlier.  The record is silent as to exactly what was said at the pre-trial about credit
    for pre-sentence custody.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant would not be the first lawyer to have a misunderstanding
    of what credit, if any, was to be given for pre-sentence custody as part of a
    plea bargain.  It is also not unusual
    that, during submissions, counsel for the defence or the Crown will innocently misstate
    a term of a plea agreement.  Inevitably, a
    brief off-the-record discussion follows and the misstatement is quickly corrected
    by either or both counsel.  That is what happened
    here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would be unreasonable to infer an intention to
    mislead the court through the misstatement of the term of the plea agreement
    relating to credit for pre-sentence custody.  Nor do I think that the judge ultimately based his finding of contempt
    on the conclusion that the appellant had deliberately misstated a term of the plea
    agreement.  The judge’s finding turned on
    his conclusion that the submission concerning pre-sentence custody left him
    with the impression that the client was not in custody on any other matter,
    such that the question whether the sentence should be consecutive did not arise.  The judge was satisfied that the submission misled
    him into imposing a different sentence than the one he had intended.  That result constituted a significant interference
    with the due administration of justice.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant dealt at some length in her written
    explanation and apology with her submission concerning credit for pre-sentence
    custody.  I will set out the entirety of
    that part of the letter:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I asked your Honour to take into consideration his
    pre-sentence custody of 31 days because I had information that Mr. Côté had
    been in custody in Ontario since September 20, 2006.  I also asked your Honour to apply his
    pre-sentence custody to the jail term because of past experience.  On the 3 or 4 pleas I did on behalf of
    clients who were in custody, I always asked the judge to take into
    consideration the pre-sentence custody.  So it was common sense to me to ask the same thing for Mr. Côté.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>I had no idea I could not ask your Honour to
    take into consideration Mr. Côté’s pre-sentence custody while Mr. Côté was
    serving another sentence somewhere else.  As mentioned earlier, the Quebec sentence had no relation whatsoever
    with the Ontario sentence.</u>  At no
    time was the Quebec sentence in my mind because it was another matter in a
    different jurisdiction, it was a closed matter and was dealt with by another
    lawyer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>It was only after July 20, 2007 I was explained
    by a colleague the consequences of asking for pre-sentence custody when a
    client is already serving a sentence.  I
    was informed that by asking this, I am double dipping.  In addition, I now understand that to an
    experienced trial judge, requesting a pre-sentence custody may leave the
    impression that the client is not in custody on any other matters.  I apologize that my submissions gave you that
    impression.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>I would never intentionally mislead this Court
    and your Honour in any way.  I have the
    highest respect for this Honourable Court and your Honour.  I understand that my representations on
    behalf of Mr. Côté contributed to your Honour to unintentionally impose a
    sentence that would have otherwise been different and I apologize for
    that.  That was never my intention to
    mislead and deceive this Court.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In hindsight, I regret accepting this plea.  Although the matter was outside the area of
    my expertise and usual practice, Mr. Côté’s matter appeared
    straightforward.  A joint position on a
    plea is usually not a complicated matter.  When this new information was brought to my attention by Mr. Côté, <u>I
    should have investigated the matter more carefully before proceeding with Mr. Côté’s
    plea.  I reiterate that in no way, was I
    intentionally deceptive or dishonest.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <h3>THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the relevant chronology, the judge summarized
    the submissions made by appellant’s counsel.  He noted that appellant’s counsel had acknowledged that the appellant
    should not have made the submissions she did and that it was quite proper for
    her to be called before the court to give an explanation and an apology.  Counsel’s reference to the “submissions” included
    the appellant’s submission that the client should get credit for the pre-sentence
    custody.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After setting out the appellant’s letter of explanation
    and apology, and summarizing the letter provided by the appellant’s law firm,
    the judge immediately made a finding of contempt, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> [The
    appellant’s] conduct in making the representations that she made to this Court
    on October 20<sup>th</sup>, 2006, <u>constitute contempt in the face of the Court.  Does her explanation and that offered by her
    employers serve to purge the contempt?</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After referring to some of the leading authorities, the
    judge reiterated what he viewed as the determinative issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Has Ms. Devost’s explanation and apology been
    sufficient to negative any finding of contempt?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge’s ultimate findings are set out in the two
    passages below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The actions of Ms. Devost were such that they
    obstructed or interfered with the administration of justice.  The Warrant of Committal for Jean-Claude Côté
    had to be amended one year later to reflect the sentence that was meant to be
    imposed.  The actions of Ms. Devost
    demonstrated a very serious disrespect for the Court and its processes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have considered the accused’s explanation and
    apology as well as all of the evidence presented as part of the contempt
    hearing.  <u>I find that the deliberate
    actions of Ms. Devost and her indifference to her duties placed the integrity
    of the administration of justice at risk.</u>  The finding of contempt has not been purged or negatived.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h1><b><span

  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The crime of contempt in the face of the court is
    unique in many ways.  It is,
    however,  a true crime requiring proof of
    prohibited conduct (<i>actus reus</i>) and
    proof that at the time the accused engaged in the prohibited conduct, he or she
    had the requisite culpable state of mind (<i>mens
    rea</i>).  Both elements must be proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>actus reus</i> of contempt in the face of the court consists of conduct that seriously
    interferes with or obstructs the administration of justice or conduct which
    causes a serious risk of interference or obstruction with the administration of
    justice:  <i>R. v. Glasner</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 242-43.  A misrepresentation that leads a judge to
    impose a different sentence than the one intended can constitute the <i>actus reus</i> of a criminal contempt.  As I read the submissions of counsel for the appellant
    at the contempt proceedings, he virtually admitted that the appellant’s
    misstatement concerning credit for pre-sentence custody did satisfy the <i>actus reus</i> requirements of criminal
    contempt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The crime of contempt also requires proof of <i>mens rea</i>.  In <i>Glasner</i>,
    Laskin J.A. described the necessary <i>mens
    rea</i> in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In short, the fault requirement for criminal
    contempt calls for deliberate or intentional conduct, or conduct which
    demonstrates indifference, which I take to be akin to recklessness.  Nothing short of that will do.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, the appellant could only be
    convicted of contempt if, at the time she made the submission concerning credit
    for pre-sentence custody, she intended to mislead the court so that the judge
    would impose a different sentence than the one intended, or she knew there was
    a risk that her misleading statement would lead to that result and she was
    indifferent to that risk in making the submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge referred to the extract from <i>Glasner</i> quoted above in the course of
    summarizing the relevant case law.  Nowhere in the reasons, however, does the judge address the requisite <i>mens rea</i> as distinct from the required <i>actus reus</i>.  As I read the reasons of the judge, he took
    the acknowledgement by the appellant that she had made a submission that had
    misled the judge into imposing a different sentence than the intended sentence
    as an admission of contempt.  The judge
    then looked to the contents of the letter for something that would justify a
    decision to not make a finding of contempt despite the admission that the
    conduct was contemptuous.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge never considered whether, on the totality of
    the evidence, the necessary <i>mens rea</i> had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  Clearly, the letter was not an admission of the requisite <i>mens rea</i>.  To the contrary, it was an express and
    emphatic denial of the existence of the <i>mens
    rea</i>.  In my view, the judge convicted
    the appellant because she made a misstatement that misled him into imposing the
    wrong sentence and because she failed to offer an explanation or apology that
    was “sufficient to negative” that conduct.  This analysis fails to address her state of mind at the relevant
    time.  Furthermore, it inappropriately
    places a burden on the appellant to negate a finding of contempt once the <i>actus reus</i> is established.  Both errors are sufficiently serious to
    require the quashing of the conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant on appeal seeks an
    acquittal.  She submits that on a proper
    understanding of the <i>mens rea</i> of
    criminal contempt, a reasonable trier of fact could not, on this record,
    convict the appellant of contempt of court.  Crown counsel contends that there is a basis in the record for a
    conviction.  Both counsel provided a
    helpful and thorough review of the record in their submissions.  Having had the benefit of these submissions,
    I think the reasonableness of a finding of contempt comes down to a
    consideration of the appellant’s letter of explanation and apology and the circumstances
    extant when the appellant made the submission for credit for pre-sentence
    custody.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her letter, the appellant explained how she came to
    make the submission she did and offered an unqualified apology for having
    unintentionally misled the judge.  Her
    counsel offered to put the appellant in the witness stand if either the Crown
    or the court saw the need to do so.  Ultimately,
    the judge rejected the explanation and apology, and found aspects of the
    explanation to be incredible.  I think that
    before rejecting the explanation and unqualified apology as disingenuous or
    otherwise inadequate, the judge should have put his specific concerns to the
    appellant and given her an opportunity to address them.  I will refer to two examples to make this
    point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge found that the appellant’s explanation in her
    letter was inadequate in part because it did not explain why she referred to
    her client as being in custody “in Ontario” since September 20, 2006 during her
    sentencing submissions.  The judge
    observed that the appellant must have known that this submission was inaccurate
    as she knew that her client had been sentenced in Québec a week earlier.  It is unclear to me from the record whether
    the client was ever in custody anywhere other than Ontario except for his court
    appearance in Québec.  If the judge considered
    the reference during the sentencing submissions to the client being in custody
    “in Ontario” as potentially undermining the validity of the appellant’s
    explanation and apology, I think it was incumbent upon him to give the
    appellant a chance to take the stand and address that concern directly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge drew an inference against the appellant based
    on the assertion in her letter that the “Quebec sentence had nothing to do with
    the current matter in Ontario”.  The
    judge noted that the appellant was well aware after speaking to a colleague
    that the sentence in Québec could have a significant effect on the operation of
    any sentence imposed in Ontario.  In the judge’s
    view, the appellant could not honestly have believed that the Québec sentence was
    irrelevant to the matters in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the judge was right in that the Québec
    sentence was not totally irrelevant to the Ontario proceedings.  What is unclear, however, is exactly what the
    appellant meant in her letter when she referred to the Québec sentence as having
    nothing to do with the Ontario matter.  There
    does not appear to have been any factual connection between the Québec and
    Ontario charges.  Indeed, on the Crown’s
    earlier application to re-open the sentencing proceeding, the judge himself
    stated, “[T]he matters for which the accused was sentenced in Québec have no
    bearing to the charges before this Court on October 20, 2006.” Once again, I
    think that if the judge was inclined to reject the appellant’s explanation and
    apology as unbelievable and insincere, he should have allowed her the
    opportunity to explain why she referred to the Québec sentence as having
    nothing to do with the Ontario proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, I think a finding
    that the appellant had the requisite <i>mens
    rea</i> for contempt could only reasonably be made if the judge rejected her
    explanation, as buttressed by her apology, for misleading the court.  Clearly, a judge is not obliged to accept an
    explanation or an apology.  There is,
    however, nothing manifestly incredible about the appellant’s explanation or any
    apparent reason to doubt the sincerity of her apology.  I say this having regard to the unchallenged
    evidence with respect to her inexperience in criminal law matters.  It was unreasonable to reject the explanation
    based on a critical parsing of parts of that explanation without affording the
    appellant an opportunity to address the specific concerns that the judge had. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the problems I see with the manner in which
    the appellant’s explanation and apology were rejected, I am also satisfied that
    on the uncontested facts as they existed when the submission was made, a
    finding that the appellant had the necessary <i>mens rea</i> is unreasonable.  The appellant barely knew the client.  She had no ongoing relationship with him beyond appearing for him on a
    joint submission, and had no apparent reason to lie to the court on his
    behalf.  The appellant had nothing to
    gain by doing so and potentially a great deal to lose.  To the extent that common sense can be a reliable
    guide to human behaviour, the appellant’s explanation that her misstatement was
    the result of her inexperience, lack of expertise, and failure to prepare
    adequately is much more plausible than the suggestion that she set out to deliberately
    mislead the court to help a client with whom she had no relationship beyond her
    very brief appearance to implement a joint sentencing submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the misrepresentation concerning credit
    for pre-sentence custody also belies a submission that it was done with the
    intention of causing the court to impose a different sentence than the intended
    sentence.  The client was serving a
    two-year sentence on the Québec charges that neither the court in Ontario nor
    the Crown knew anything about.  The
    appellant knew that if the judge said nothing, the sentence he imposed would be
    concurrent to the Québec sentence.  If
    the sentence was concurrent, the client had nothing to gain by being given
    credit for pre-sentence custody on a one-year sentence to be imposed in Ontario.  Even if the judge had acceded to the request
    for credit for time served, it would have made no difference to the client as
    long as the judge did not know about the Québec sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would have thought that if the appellant wanted to
    assist the client by getting him a 12-month concurrent sentence in Ontario
    despite the judge’s intention of imposing a 12-month sentence that was not
    concurrent to any other sentence, the best way for the appellant to achieve
    that result would have been to say nothing in the hope that the matter would
    proceed with the imposition of the agreed upon 12-month sentence.  That sentence would become concurrent by the operation
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as long as it
    was not expressly made consecutive.  The
    submission concerning credit for pre-sentence custody, that had no practical
    value to the client, could well have precipitated inquiries as to the client’s pre-trial
    status at the time of the sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Treating the appellant’s submissions concerning credit
    for pre-sentence custody as part of a scheme to mislead the judge into imposing
    a concurrent sentence requires that one assume that the appellant had thought
    through the various scenarios and decided that the best way to mislead the
    judge about her client’s status was not by remaining silent, but rather by
    bringing up the issue of credit for pre-sentence custody in order to hopefully
    pre-empt any inquiry by the judge as to her client’s custodial status.  This strategy makes sense only if one assumes
    that the appellant was not only prepared to mislead the court, but had chosen a
    somewhat daring and subtle way of doing so.  This strategy also ascribes to the appellant a degree of sophistication
    in matters relating to criminal sentencing that is inconsistent with her
    limited experience and her obvious lack of familiarity with concepts like
    credit for pre-sentence custody, which is evident from the content of her
    submission quoted earlier in these reasons (see para. 13).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the appellant’s letter of explanation
    and apology, and the circumstances at the time the submission was made, I think
    it would be unreasonable for a trier of fact to hold that the appellant’s
    representation concerning credit for pre-sentence custody was made with the <i>mens rea</i> required to justify a finding
    of criminal contempt.  </p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>V</span></b></h1>
  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s inexperience and somewhat cavalier approach
    to the sentencing proceedings caused the administration of justice to go off
    the rails when sentencing her client.  Fortunately,
    that error has been rectified.  The appellant’s
    conduct is quite properly the subject of criticism.  The appellant’s letter demonstrates that she
    has come to appreciate her shortcomings in the handling of this matter and that
    she understands and regrets the significant adverse consequences that flowed
    from her conduct of these proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is one thing, albeit a serious thing, to declare
    that a lawyer’s inexperience or even incompetence has led to conduct that has frustrated,
    at least for a time, the proper administration of justice.  It is quite another thing, and a much more
    serious thing, to declare that a lawyer has acted criminally in the discharge
    of his or her duties by intentionally frustrating the due administration of
    justice.  The judge was fully justified
    in conducting a full and careful inquiry into the appellant’s actions.  With respect, however, having regard to the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i>, it was unreasonable
    in all of the circumstances to label the appellant’s conduct as criminal.  </p>
