  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Daniel Lee Thompson, was charged with
    murder in the death of Kevin Monroe.  The
    respondent offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, and, following a
    preliminary inquiry, the Crown consented to entry of the plea.  During the sentencing proceedings, the parties
    did not present a joint submission on sentence.  However, due to what was essentially a
    mathematical error involving credit for pre-trial custody, the sentencing judge
    appeared to believe that the effective difference between the low end of the
    Crown’s range and high end of the defence’s range was only one <span
class=GramE>day.</span>  The sentencing
    judge considered that a sentence of four years less a day was appropriate.  Given that the respondent had spent one year
    in pre-trial custody, the judge sentenced the respondent to two years less a
    day in a provincial reformatory, followed by three years probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown now seeks leave to appeal from the sentence
    imposed.  It raises three issues on this
    appeal: whether supplementary reasons released by the sentencing judge can be
    considered on this appeal; whether the sentencing judge erred in principle in
    rendering his sentence; and whether the sentence imposed was demonstrably
    unfit.  While I agree with the appellant
    that the supplementary reasons provided by the trial judge in this case cannot
    be considered on appeal, for the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After attending a party on the evening of September 19,
    2008, the respondent and several of his friends went to the apartment of Alan
    Clark.  The victim, Kevin Monroe, was
    living in Mr. Clark’s apartment at the time, and was asleep on a couch in the
    living room when the partygoers arrived.  Mr. Monroe was described as being muscular, had a criminal record
    including crimes of violence, and had the reputation of being “the craziest guy
    in Picton”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the crowd arrived at the apartment, some of the
    partygoers started to go through Mr. Monroe’s belongings looking for
    cigarettes.  Mr. Monroe awoke and, upset,
    pushed several of the partygoers around, including the respondent’s former
    girlfriend. The group responded by ganging up on Mr. Monroe and inflicting 27
    blunt force injuries, and 3 stab wounds.  Two of the stab wounds penetrated Mr. Monroe’s lung, one of which also
    severed an artery.  Expert evidence
    established that these two wounds caused or contributed to the victim’s
    death.  A third knife wound injured Mr.
    Monroe’s liver but, according to the pathologist, did not cause or contribute
    to Mr. Monroe’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent initially denied any involvement in the
    homicide but later confessed to being present.  He explained that when he entered the apartment, the initial physical
    confrontation between Monroe and the others had already begun.  He saw his ex-girlfriend lying on the ground,
    having already been attacked by the victim.  He then saw everyone start kicking the victim.  He admitted that he then picked up a knife
    from a nearby table and stabbed the victim once as the victim was lying on the
    ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was genuinely remorseful and, soon after
    his arrest, wrote a letter of apology to the relatives of the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter and a
    sentencing hearing proceeded on the basis of an agreed statement of facts.  The agreed statement was the product of
    various witnesses’ statements and testimony given at the preliminary inquiry as
    well as expert reports.  In several
    respects, the agreed statement of facts was internally inconsistent.  Where there were inconsistencies, the sentencing
    judge adopted the facts most favourable to the respondent.  As a result, the sentencing judge proceeded
    on the basis that the respondent inflicted the non-fatal stab wound.  He also accepted that provocation, based upon
    the respondent’s reaction to the victim’s assault on his ex-girlfriend, would
    have been a live issue at the trial.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Position
    of the parties at the sentencing hearing</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown and defence did not make a joint submission on sentence.  The respondent has been detained for
    approximately 1 year prior to his guilty plea, and all parties agreed that this
    time ought to be credited at a rate of two for one.  The Crown was seeking a sentence of six to
    eight years, less credit for pre-trial custody.  The defence sought a sentence of two years less a day after pre-trial
    detention was taken into account.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    sentencing hearing proceeded for approximately 1 ½ days and, in the course of
    it, defence counsel made the following comment:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>My friends are at six to eight years less time
    served so the divergence between our respective submissions only occurs at the
    high end of that range Your Honour.  If
    you apply Mr. Thompson’s pre-trial custody to the low end of the range
    suggested by my friend, we’re at the same amount time – four years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown made no comment in response to this
    submission.  However, it was clearly
    wrong: the Crown was seeking a four-year sentence after having taken pre-trial
    custody into account.  The defence, on
    the other hand, was seeking four years less a day before credit for pre-trial
    custody had been applied. </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Reasons
    of the sentencing judge</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the outset of his reasons, the sentencing judge referenced the submission made
    by defence counsel concerning the purported overlap of the Crown and defence
    positions.  The sentencing judge then
    carefully reviewed the law and the submissions of counsel.  He then listed the aggravating and mitigating
    circumstances as follows:</span></p>

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent’s conduct might have been
    influenced by Monroe’s attack against his former girlfriend.  Although this would not likely have given
    rise to a viable self-defence claim during a trial, it might have approached
    provocation;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span

'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent has few real skills and a limited
    education.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge then instructed himself on the
    principles of sentencing in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Before concluding, he again
    referenced defence counsel’s understanding of the overlap on sentencing as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I indicated to you earlier the lower end of the
    Crown’s submission and the Defence submission are almost identical and for the
    matter of one day, I am prepared to sentence accordingly given all of the
    circumstances, a non-penitentiary term of imprisonment would satisfy the
    principles of sentencing set out in <i>The
    Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here again, neither counsel commented on the error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge then sentenced the respondent to
    two years less a day after crediting him for the equivalent of two years for
    pre-trial custody.  To this he added
    three years probation explaining that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you were to go to the penitentiary, I would not
    be able to put you on probation but because your sentence is confined to a
    reformatory situation; that is, two years less one day, you will be sentenced
    to three years probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge then added that he recommended
    that the respondent be admitted to the St. Lawrence Valley Treatment Centre in
    Brockville so that he might be treated for the psychological disorder he is
    suspected to suffer from.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After counsel and the respondent had left the
    courthouse the sentencing judge realized that he had made a mathematical error
    in concluding that the Crown and defence had both suggested <span class=GramE>that</span> four years was an appropriate sentence.  He spoke to the court reporter and advised her that he would be
    providing expanded reasons shortly.  These were incorporated in the transcript and explained that, after
    leaving the courtroom, he had realized the obvious error he had made in
    accepting defence counsel’s calculation.  He noted that neither counsel had commented on the error and went on to
    explain as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given
    this obvious error on my part, I felt obligated to write this footnote.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Firstly,
    I do not believe that Counsel intentionally misled me and, for reasons which
    are otherwise contained in my Judgment, I would have arrived at the same
    conclusion as to the appropriate and fair sentence in this case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Secondly, I apologize
    for the inconvenience which I have caused to the justice system.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal sentence and, if

    addition to pre-trial custody.</p>

    Crown argues that this court cannot rely on the sentencing judge’s additional
    reasons because he was <i>functus officio</i> when they were given.  The respondent
    submits that the addendum is either the simple correction of an error or, in
    the alternative, a clarification of the reasons rendered at the sentencing
    hearing: see <i>R. v. Malicia</i> (2006),
    211 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.).  As I
    will explain below, in my view the doctrine of <i>functus officio</i> is not the correct tool to use in analyzing this
    issue.</span></p>

    that “[i]n judge alone cases, the point of no return is after the trial judge
    endorses the indictment.”  Once the
    indictment is endorsed, the trial judge is <i>functus
    officio</i>, and normally may not alter his or her order. <i>Malicia</i> allows only that in limited circumstances a judge can
    correct errors made in recording his or her manifest intent, or otherwise
    confirm or clarify the substance of the decision made, so long as it does not
    involve a reconsideration of the decision.</span></p>

    the present case, the sentence imposed was clear and manifest.  There was no need for clarification.  Indeed, in the addendum, the sentencing judge
    neither altered nor clarified the sentence that he imposed.  His added comments were directed towards
    correcting an error in his reasons for sentence, and not towards the sentence
    itself.  He sought to clarify not what he
    decided, but why he decided it.  The
    doctrine of <i>functus officio</i> is
    concerned with what a given decision was, not why the decision was made.</span></p>

    to this case, it is apparent from the words used by the sentencing judge in his
    addendum that the addendum is in the nature of after-the-fact reasons, which
    cannot be considered on appeal.  In the
    addendum the sentencing judge clearly acknowledges the mistake he made in his
    reasons for sentence.  He then goes on to
    explain what he “would have” done had he not made the mistake.  It is clear therefore, that he was not expanding
    on the reasons for the decision he did in fact make, but rather, providing
    reasons for the decision he would have made but for the error.</span></p>

    of the appeal. However, this is not determinative of the appeal. Rather, this

    they reveal an error in principle, or resulted in a sentence that was

    Crown alleges an error in principle based on the judge’s misapprehension of the
    positions of the parties.  It claims that
    the judge approached sentencing as if the parties had presented a joint
    submission of four years less credit for pre-trial custody.  The respondent concedes that the sentencing
    judge misapprehended the positions of counsel but argues that, to succeed, the
    Crown must show that the misapprehension is sufficiently material so as to
    warrant appellate intervention.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is not disputed that the trial judge misapprehended a fact, that being that the
    low end of the Crown’s position on sentencing and the high end of the
    respondent’s position <span class=GramE>were  only</span> one day apart.  If, as the Crown suggests, this means that
    the sentencing judge then approached the sentencing as if there had been a
    joint submission, this would constitute an error in principle.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where
    a judge considers a joint submission, he or she considers whether the proposed
    sentence would be against public policy, or otherwise bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute: see <i>R. v.

    the submissions of counsel and the reasons of the sentencing judge, it is clear
    that the judge did not believe there was a joint submission.  He understood that the parties disputed what
    the proper sentence should be.  Rather
    than consider whether a reformatory sentence would be against public policy or
    bring the administration of justice into disrepute, he considered the
    aggravating and mitigating factors present in the case, examined relevant case
    law, and ultimately settled on a sentence he viewed as fit.  Even with the mathematical error, the sentencing
    judge was aware that the Crown was seeking penitentiary time, while the defence
    was advocating for a high reformatory sentence. </span></p>

    question therefore is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the
    sentencing judge’s misapprehension of a fact rises to the level of an error in
    principle.  Put another way, I need to
    consider what impact, if <span class=GramE>any,</span> the error on overlap had
    on the sentencing judge’s reasoning process.  </span></p>

    order to assess the impact of the error, the reasons need to be read as a whole
    and in context.  That context includes

    submissions make it clear that the Crown and respondent were advancing
    different positions on sentence.  The
    respective positions of the parties were correctly set out in the sentencing
    judge’s reasons.  While he may have
    started and ended his reasons by stating the mathematical error, the balance of
    the sentencing judge’s reasons standing alone were complete and thorough.  The judge canvassed the aggravating and
    mitigating circumstances as well as the circumstances of the offence and the offender.
     He was fully aware of his ultimate duty
    to impose a sentence on the respondent that was fit.  After his analysis, the sentencing judge
    concluded that a non-penitentiary term of imprisonment satisfied the principles
    of sentencing set out in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, and sentenced the respondent accordingly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    not specifically addressed in his reasons, it is apparent that the sentencing
    judge considered a sentence of two years less a day to better meet the
    sentencing goal of rehabilitation than the lengthier penitentiary term the
    Crown asked him to consider.  It
    permitted him to impose a three-year term of probation on this youthful
    offender.  As well, a reformatory
    sentence allowed the respondent to be referred to the St. Lawrence Valley
    Correction and Treatment Center, a facility that accepts referrals from inmates
    serving time in the Provincial system only.  With respect to this latter point,
    respondent’s counsel on appeal advised that the respondent had been approved to
    go to the St. Lawrence facility for treatment with the expectation that his
    admission would be in May 2010.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    a result, when viewed in the context of the evidence as a whole, I am persuaded
    that the mistaken understanding as to the relative positions taken by the Crown
    and the respondent did not play a significant role in the sentencing judge’s
    reasoning.  It is apparent that, even
    absent the error, he would not have imposed a penitentiary sentence. In his
    view, a reformatory sentence would be most appropriate in this case, and he
    imposed the longest reformatory sentence available in law.  I conclude, therefore, that the mistake is
    not sufficient in and of itself to constitute an error in principle entitling
    this court to interfere with the sentence.</span></p>

    search for a fit sentence in cases of manslaughter is a difficult one given the
    wide range of circumstances in which the offence can be committed, and the wide
    range of sentences available under the <i>Code</i>.  This court has acknowledged the existence of
    a broad discretion in this area in <i>R. v.
    Turcotte</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 97 wherein the court stated, at para. 19,
    that “while many, if not most, sentences for manslaughter are in the
    penitentiary range, maximum reformatory sentences are not unknown and are
    clearly within the acceptable range.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    this case exhibits many aggravating factors, the facts in several of the cases
    relied on by the Crown for a sentence in the six to eight year range are
    clearly more egregious than those in this case.  Cases such as <i>R. v. Cleyndert</i>,
    2006 CanLII 33851 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>R. v.
    Clarke</i> (2003), 172 O.A.C. 133 (C.A.) did not involve a guilty plea, and in
    both cases, the accused carried a knife on his person, used it multiple times,
    and actually caused the death of the victim.  Further, in <i>Cleyndert</i>, there was a specific finding as to the lack of remorse
    on the part of the accused.</span></p>

    establish that high single digit sentences are within the range of appropriate
    sentences for offenders similar to the respondent.  However, it does not necessarily follow that
    because a higher sentence may have also been <span class=GramE>fit,</span> the
    four-year sentence imposed in this case was unfit.</span></p>

    view these cases to be of assistance as they both involved exceptional
    circumstances that are not present in the instant appeal.  The case of <i>R. v. Brizard</i>, 2006 CanLII 5444 (ON C.A.) is, however, closer to
    the circumstances in the present case.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Brizard</i>, this court reduced the
    sentence for manslaughter from eight years to five years on the basis that,
    despite it being a very grave offence, the offender was a member of an
    aboriginal community, was heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence, was a
    party rather than a principal to the offence and did not factually cause the
    victim’s death.  Although the offender
    had a criminal record, he had no prior record for crimes of violence.  </span></p>

    the present case, the respondent was nineteen at the time of the offence and
    was clearly very remorseful.  The
    respondent had a relatively limited role in the homicide in that he appears to
    have joined an ongoing assault of the victim by others.  Because the trial judge deemed the respondent to
    have inflicted the stab wound that neither caused nor contributed to the death
    of the victim, he can be considered a party rather than a principal in the
    offence.  When comparison is made with <i>Brizard</i>, the two are fairly
    similar.  In the circumstances of this
    case, while the four year sentence imposed is at the low end of the range, it
    is not, in my view, demonstrably unfit.</span></p>
