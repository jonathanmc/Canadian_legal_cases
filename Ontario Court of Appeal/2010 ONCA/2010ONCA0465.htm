    80”, contrary to s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  At trial, the Crown relied on
    the testimony of the blood technician to establish that Mr. Kernighan’s two
    breathalyzer readings were 140 milligrams and 130 milligrams of alcohol per 100
    mL of blood.  The readings were taken
    within two hours of the alleged offence.</p>

    the readings.  Instead, he argued that
    the readings did not reflect his blood alcohol content at 9:38 p.m., the time
    at which he was driving.</p>

    time, Mr. Kernighan testified that on the night in question he consumed only
    five beers and that he had stopped drinking just before 9:00 p.m.  Based on Mr. Kernighan’s account of events,
    the expert toxicologist called by the defence opined that Mr. Kernighan’s blood
    alcohol concentration would have been between 0 and 41 milligrams of alcohol
    per 100 mL of blood when he was pulled over by the police.  </p>

    of the breathalyzer readings and the evidence as a whole, the trial judge found
    that Mr. Kernighan’s “evidence to the contrary” was not reasonably capable of

    that the trial judge had not erred in taking the breathalyzer readings into
    consideration in assessing the evidence to the contrary and the appellant’s
    credibility.  Accordingly, by judgment
    dated June 15, 2007 (the “Judgment”), the appeal was dismissed.    </p>

    oral hearing of the appeal, t<span lang=EN-US>he Crown advised that this court has heard, and reserved its decision in, <i>R. v. Chow</i>, 2010 ONCA 422.  The court was advised that submissions based
    on <i>Boucher</i> had been made in <i>Chow</i>.  In light of this information, the court declined to decide the leave motion
    at that time and invited the parties to make submissions on the merits of the
    appeal.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    appellant submits that the majority decision in <i>Boucher </i>establishes that
    under no circumstances can breathalyzer readings be used to assess the
    credibility of any evidence to the contrary.  In making this argument, he relies on para. 43 of the reasons of
    Deschamps J., writing for the majority, in which she says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The judge also erred when she stated that the
    credibility of the accused and his witnesses could be assessed in light of the
    results of the breathalyser tests before applying the presumption. …
    Breathalyzer results cannot be used to assess the credibility of a
    witness.  As I explained earlier, it
    would be circular to rely on the test results to determine whether there is
    evidence that could raise a doubt regarding those very results.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appellant submits, the trial judge erred because she took the breathalyzer
    results into account in assessing the evidence to the contrary and in assessing
    the appellant’s credibility.      <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown maintains that <i>Boucher</i> establishes that the prohibition against using breathalyzer
    readings in assessing credibility applies only to those cases in which the
    accused challenges the presumption of accuracy because, in such circumstances,
    it would be circular to use the readings as proof of their own accuracy.  In the present case, the Crown did not rely
    on the presumption of accuracy but, rather, on the oral evidence of the breath
    technician to establish the accuracy of the readings.  Defence counsel at trial took no issue with
    respect to the accuracy of the breathalyser.  As defence counsel challenged only the presumption of identity, the
    trial judge was entitled to consider the appellant’s breathalyzer
    readings.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept the Crown’s submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The presumption of accuracy relates to the
    accused’s blood alcohol concentration at the time the breath sample was taken.  Challenging this presumption requires
    adducing some evidence that the certificate does not in fact correctly reflect
    the accused’s blood alcohol level at the time of the breathalyzer test: see <i>Boucher</i>, at para. 21.  The presumption of identity, on the other
    hand, relates to the accused’s blood alcohol concentration at the time of the
    offence.  Challenging the presumption of
    identity requires adducing some evidence to suggest that the accused’s blood
    alcohol concentration at the time of the offence was not the same as it was at
    the time that the breath samples were taken: see <i>Boucher</i>, at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The presumption of accuracy allows the Crown to
    file the certificate of the breath technician as proof of the appellant’s
    breath sample readings without having to call the breath technician as a
    witness in the trial (s. 258(1)(g)).  In
    the present case, the Crown chose to call the breath technician as a witness
    and, therefore, did not rely on the presumption of accuracy.  It relied only on the presumption of identity,
    contained in ss. 258(1)(c) and (d.1), to establish the blood alcohol content at
    the time of driving. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, <i>Boucher </i>and subsequent case
    law make clear that the prohibition against using breathalyzer readings to
    assess the accused’s evidence to the contrary applies only to situations in
    which the Crown is relying on the presumption of accuracy and the accused is
    challenging that presumption.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Boucher</i>,
    the court was dealing with a situation in which the Crown was relying on
    the presumption of accuracy and the accused challenged the presumption with
    evidence to the contrary.  This is clear
    from para. 1 of the reasons of Deschamps J., in which she states the issue to
    be:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>what evidence may be used to rebut the presumption
    of accuracy set out in s. 258(1)(<span class=italic>g</span>) of the <span
class=italic><i>Criminal Code</i></span>, according
    to which the reading received on a breathalyzer test provides, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, an accurate determination of the blood alcohol
    level at the time of the test?  [citation
    omitted]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her reasons in <i>Boucher</i>, dissenting in
    part but not on this issue, Charron J. emphasized that the majority reasons
    applied exclusively to those cases in which the Crown relies on the presumption
    of accuracy, rather than the presumption of identity.  At para. 65, Charron J. states:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It is
    important to note, however, that the situation is not the same when it is clear
    that the defence is challenging only the presumption of identity,</i> for
    example where an accused testifies that he consumed eight ounces of alcohol
    between the time he was arrested and the time the breath samples were taken. <i>In such a case, the trier of fact can
    properly consider the breathalyzer result in assessing the evidence to the
    contrary adduced by the accused, since what is disputed is not the accuracy of
    that result but only the fact that it reflects the accused's blood alcohol
    level at the time the offence was committed</i>. In this way, even if the trier
    of fact accepts the accused's testimony that he drank alcohol between the time
    he was arrested and the time he took the breathalyzer test, the trier can take
    into account an especially high breathalyzer result, among other factors, to
    find that, notwithstanding the alcohol consumed subsequently, the accused's
    blood alcohol level already exceeded the legal limit when he was arrested, and
    accordingly to reject the accused's evidence to the contrary. [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Boucher </i>has
    been interpreted in this way in a number of Ontario decisions.  For example, in the present case, both the
    trial judge and the summary conviction appeal judge relied on <i>R. v. Lilek</i>, 2006 CanLII 9155 (ON S.C.).  In <i>Lilek</i>, as in this case, the
    Crown at trial had relied on the presumption of identity but not the
    presumption of accuracy.  Justice
    Trafford found that the trial judge had not erred in considering the
    appellant’s breathalyzer readings when assessing his evidence to the
    contrary.  He wrote:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This principle of law, that the credibility of a
    defendant is to be assessed in the context of the evidence as a whole, is a
    long-standing one.  Thus, I respectfully
    decline to interpret the remarks of Deschamps J. in para. 43 of <i>R. v. Boucher</i>, <i>supra</i>, as an authoritative statement overruling them.  Rather I limit it to a case where the issue
    of “evidence to the contrary” under s. 258(1)(g) of the <i>Code</i> [the presumption of accuracy] is being determined by a Court.  Thus, the learned trial judge did not err in
    law when he considered the breathalyzer readings in this case and rejected the
    appellant’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For a similar analysis, see <i>R. v. Snider</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 879 (Ont. Ct. J.) where MacDonnell J.
    arrived at the same conclusion, as to the impact of <i>R. v. Boucher</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    paras. 39-45 and as to the use of the breathalyzer results in assessing a
    defendant’s credibility where the Crown is not relying upon the presumption of
    accuracy at paras. 46-49.  See also <i>R. v.</i> <i>Brown</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 5283 at paras. 28 and 29 (S.C.J.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where defence counsel challenges the presumption
    of identity but not the presumption of accuracy, a consideration of the
    breathalyzer readings does not raise the spectre of circular reasoning.  They are part of the body of evidence
    presented at trial and thus part of what the trial judge must consider in
    determining whether the defence evidence is capable of raising a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would make a final point in relation to the
    merits of the appeal.  The appellant had
    originally raised a second ground of appeal, namely, that the trial judge erred
    by misapprehending the evidence of his mother, who testified at trial.  He did not pursue this ground at the oral
    hearing of the appeal.  To the extent
    that it remains a live issue, I see nothing in it. </p>
