  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quizno’s Canada Restaurant Corporation, Quiz-Can LLC, The
    Quizno’s Master LLC (collectively “Quiznos”), Gordon Food Service, Inc. and GFS
    Canada Company Inc. (collectively “GFS”) appeal from the order of the
    Divisional Court dated April 27, 2009, which conditionally certified the within
    action as a class proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quiznos is the franchisor of a chain of some 427 fast
    food restaurants located across Canada.  GFS is the distributor of food and other supplies to Quiznos
    restaurants.  GFS operates through five
    affiliated companies, which distribute products to Quiznos restaurants through
    eight distribution centres across the country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents are two former Quiznos franchisees in Ontario,
    who seek to represent a class of all Canadian Quiznos franchisees in business
    on or after May 12, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essence of the dispute between Quiznos and the
    franchisees is that the franchisees allege that they have been charged
    exorbitant prices for food and other supplies they purchase for use in their
    restaurants.  Against GFS, it is alleged
    that they have engaged in a civil conspiracy with Quiznos in which they aided
    and abetted a price maintenance scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Superior Court, Perell J. dismissed the motion for
    an order certifying the action as a class proceeding.  The Divisional Court reversed the motion
    court judge.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Quiznos franchise system was established in the
    United States 25 years ago and commenced operation in Canada in 2001.  The relationship between Quiznos and the
    franchisees is governed by a standard form franchise agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Quiznos system requires the franchisees to offer
    common menu items made from uniform supplies.  There is a common operating manual and common advertising.  The franchisees may not sell at prices which
    exceed prices mandated by Quiznos.  Franchisees pay royalties of 7 per cent on gross sales.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees are required to purchase all equipment,
    products, services, supplies and materials from common sources or from sources
    with common ownership, which are designated by Quiznos.  Quiznos has designated GFS to sell and
    distribute a full line of products including meats, produce, frozen foods,
    dairy goods, <span class=GramE>paper</span> and cleaning chemicals to the franchisees
    in Ontario.  Quiznos has designated four
    companies affiliated with GFS to sell and distribute supplies to franchisees in
    the rest of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees allege that Quiznos, aided by GFS, has
    established a price maintenance scheme in which large sums of money are
    extracted from the franchisees from the sale of supplies.  It is alleged that prices paid by the
    franchisees pursuant to this scheme are inflated and commercially unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the alleged price maintenance scheme,
    the franchisees further allege:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      They have
    been denied the ability to negotiate lower prices of supplies with the GFS
    defendants and other suppliers.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      They
    have been hindered, prevented or denied the opportunity to source identical
    supplies from other suppliers.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      They
    have been hindered, prevented or denied the opportunity to compete equitably
    with competitors whose prices are not unlawfully enhanced, fixed and
    maintained.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      They
    have experienced declining profitability, or are suffering losses, including
    unsustainable losses, which, if unabated, will result in irreparable harm
    including, <i>inter alia</i>, loss of total
    investment by some Class Members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees assert three causes of action:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)       breach of the price maintenance
    provisions of the <i>Competition Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)      conspiracy among the defendants
    (appellants) to fix prices; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     breach of contract </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 61(1)(a) of the <i>Competition Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No person who is engaged in the business of producing
    or supplying a product…shall, directly or indirectly…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by
    agreement, threat, promise or any like means, attempt to influence upward, or
    to discourage the reduction of, the price at which any other person engaged in
    business in Canada supplies or offers to supply or advertises a product within
    Canada…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees claim against the Quiznos defendants:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>compensation and damages in the amount of $75 million
    for conduct that is contrary to s. 61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an interim, interlocutory and permanent injunction
    preventing Quiznos and GFS from engaging in the price maintenance scheme;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$75 million for breach of contract including breach of
    the common law duty of good faith; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>an</span> amount equal to the full
    investigative costs of the plaintiffs and the plaintiff class, pursuant to s.
    36 of the <i>Competition Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees claim against Quiznos and GFS: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>damages in the amount of $75 million for civil con-spiracy;</p>

    aggravated damages in an amount to be determined by the court.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE MOTION COURT DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two motions before the motion court: a
    motion by the franchisees to certify the action as a class proceeding pursuant
    to the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O.</i> 1992, c. 6 and a motion by Quiznos to stay the action.  Only the certification motion is in issue in
    this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5(1) of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>5.</u></b><u> (1) </u>  The Court shall certify a class
    proceeding on a motion under section 2, 3 or 4 if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> pleadings or the
    notice of application discloses a cause of action;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>there</span> is an identifiable
    class of two or more persons that would be represented by the representative
    plaintiff or defendant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)  <span class=GramE>the</span> claims or
    defences of the class members raise common issues;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) <span class=GramE>a</span> class proceeding
    would be the preferable proce-dure for the resolution of the common issues; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)  <span class=GramE>there</span> is a
    representative plaintiff or defendant who, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) <span
class=GramE>would</span> fairly and adequately represent the interests of the
    class,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) <span class=GramE>has</span> produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a workable method of advancing
    the proceeding on behalf of the class and of notifying class members of the
    proceeding, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) <span class=GramE>does</span> not have, on the common issues for the class, an interest in conflict with the
    interests of other class members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of s. 5(1)(a) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> the motion judge concluded that the statement
    of claim disclosed causes of action for breach of s. 61 of the <i>Competition Act</i>, breach of contract and
    civil conspiracy.  The motion judge also
    found that “all persons, including firms and corporations, carrying on business
    in Canada under a Quiznos franchise agreement on or after May 12, 2006” with a
    slight alteration (the date for closure of the class membership) was an
    identifiable class as required by s. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s refusal to certify this case as a
    class proceeding turned on his analysis of the proposed common issues pursuant
    to s. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>.  The
    franchisees proposed the following common issues before the motion judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have the Quiznos defendants, or any of them, engaged in
    conduct contrary to Section 61(1) of the <i>Competition
    Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have the defendants, or any of them, engaged in conduct
    that amounts to civil conspiracy?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>(Issue
    deferred)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have the Quiznos defendants, or any of them, engaged in
    conduct which constitutes a breach of their contractual obligations to the
    Class Members?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have the Class Members suffered loss or damage as a
    result of any of the conduct referred to in issues a, b, c, or d?  If so, what is the appropriate measure or
    amount of such loss or damages?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should the court award an aggregate assessment of
    monetary relief on behalf of some or all class members?  If so, what is the amount of the aggregate
    assessment and how should the class members share in the award?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(g)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should the defendants pay punitive, exemplary or
    aggravated damages to the Class Members?  Should such damages be assessed in the aggregate?  If so, what is the amount of such damages
    including pre- and post-judgment interest thereon?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(h)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are the Class Members entitled to recover from the
    Quiznos defendants the full costs of their investigations and the full costs of
    this proceeding, including contingent legal fees on a complete indemnity basis,
    under section 36(1) of the <i>Competition
    Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is often the case in certification motions, the problem
    for the franchisees before the motion judge was the issue of damages.  The appellants argued that because damages
    constitute an individual issue for each franchisee it was not appropriate to be
    treat them as a common issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees tendered the evidence of an economist,
    Dr. Andy Baziliauskas, in respect of the damages issue.  Dr. Baziliauskas testified that the quantum
    of the over-charge from the alleged price maintenance conspiracy could be
    calculated by taking the difference between the prices paid by the franchisees
    and the prices they would have paid but for the price maintenance
    conspiracy.  The economist testified that
    actual prices would be available from the financial records of the parties and the
    “but for” prices could be taken from industry data.  Thus, the difference between actual prices
    and “but for” prices could be applied on a class wide basis to prove
    damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argued that actual prices would vary on
    a class wide basis because of a number of variables including: whether the
    supplies are purchased outside of the authorized distribution system, whether
    the franchisee qualifies for a rebate, individual credit terms, waste, employee
    theft and sharing among franchisees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also argued that “but for” prices would
    vary on a class wide basis because of circumstances particular to individual
    franchisees such as location, financial capacity and purchasing power.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants relied on their own expert economist,
    Dr. Roger Ware, who testified that the impact of the alleged price maintenance
    scheme would have to be assessed on an individual franchise and product by
    product basis across the country.  The
    motion judge summarized the expert opinions as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[112] Thus, relying on the critique of Dr. Ware,
    the Defendants disputed Dr. Baziliauskas’ opinion that that (<i>sic</i>) there were three methodologies for
    extrapolating “but for” prices on a class-wide basis; namely: (1) by using
    “benchmark prices,” which are prices paid for substantially similar products
    purchased by a comparator coalition of buyers where there is no price
    maintenance agreement between the franchisor and its distributor; (2) by using
    a “servicing fee” analysis, which is to take the difference between the sourcing
    and mark-ups charged under the distribution agreement under which GFS-Canada
    supplied goods and the fees charged by other franchisors in similar
    circumstances but where there is no price maintenance; and (3) by using a
    “before and after comparison,” which is to compare the prices charged to the
    Quiznos franchises before and after the purported price maintenance began.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[113] I agree with the criticism of the Defendants
    that: (a) Dr. Baziliauskas has not shown that a comparator group of franchisees
    or a comparator franchisor can be identified; (b) he has not explained how it
    could be determined that a comparator group of franchisees was paying for
    product free of price maintenance by its franchisor; and (c) with respect to
    the before and after methodology, he has not shown that there was or that it
    could be determined that there was a time before price maintenance began.  In my opinion, these omissions make his three
    methodologies conceptually unsound and not feasible to measure a class-wide
    impact of price maintenance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the above, the motion judge concluded
    that it was not shown by the franchisees that their damages, if any, could be
    proven in the aggregate on a class wide basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having disposed of damages, the motion judge turned to
    the other common issues advanced by the franchisees in para. 115 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This conclusion removes proposed common issue (f) [aggregate
    assessment of damages] as a common issue and has the effect of an avalanche
    that buries the proposed common issues with an absence of commonality and a
    proliferation of individual issues.  Thus, for instance, pro-posed common issues (a) and (b) above (namely:
    (a) Have the Quiznos Defendants, or any of them, engaged in conduct contrary to
    section 61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i>?
    And (b) Have the Defendants, or any of them, engaged in conduct that amounts to
    civil conspiracy?) <span class=GramE>depend</span> upon showing: individual
    instances of price maintenance; individual instances of suffering loss in the
    “but for” world in order to measure the impact of losses; and individual claims
    of damages for the tort of conspiracy.  Similarly, proposed common issues (d), and (e) are individual not common
    issues.  Proposed common issues (g) and
    (h) have commonality but, standing alone, they would not sufficiently advance
    the litigation to qualify as common issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The franchisees relied on ss. 23(1) and 24(1) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>, which they
    claimed assisted them in establishing a common issue in respect of
    damages.  Sections 23(1) and 24(1)
    provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Statistical
    evidence</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>23<span class=GramE>.(</span>1) For the purposes of determining issues relating
    to the amount or distribution of a monetary award under this Act, the court may
    admit as evidence statistical information that would not otherwise be
    admissible as evidence, including information derived from sampling, if the
    information was compiled in accordance with principles that are generally
    accepted by experts in the field of statistics.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Aggregate

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24. (1)            <span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       no

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       <span
class=GramE>the</span> aggregate or a part of the defendant’s liability to some
    or all class members can reasonably be determined without proof by individual
    class members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that neither section was of any
    help to the franchisees.  He was of the
    view that s. 23(1) related to the distribution of damages and had nothing to do
    with the determination of the entitlement to damages.  He further concluded that s.&nbsp;24(1)
    “provides a method to assess the quantum of damages on a global or aggregate
    basis, but not the fact of damage”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following from the above analysis, the motion judge
    concluded that a class proceeding would not be the preferable procedure for the
    resolution of the proposed common issues as required by s. 5(1)(d) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the motion judge concluded, in accordance with
    s. 5(1)(e) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>,
    that the two named franchisees are satisfactory representative plaintiffs
    subject to the filing of a better litigation plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the motion for certification was
    dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE DIVISIONAL COURT DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hennessy and Karakatsanis J.J., for the majority, would
    have allowed the appeal from the decision of the motion judge.  Swinton J., in dissent, would have dismissed
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority concluded that the motion judge erred in
    focusing solely on the damages issue and failed to consider the other proposed
    common issues.  The majority said at
    paragraph 45 of their reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, whether one of the proposed common
    issues is overwhelmed or buried by the individual issues is part of the
    analysis for the preferable procedure criterion, but is not necessarily
    determinative of the common issues requirement.  The remaining proposed common issues ought to have been analysed.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The majority stated further at para. 47 of their reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We are satisfied that the motions judge erred in
    principle by focusing on proof of damages and failing to consider and identify
    other common issues.  Even if the motions
    judge made no reversible error with respect to his assessment that the expert
    evidence provided no basis in fact to prove damages on a class wide basis, he
    erred in failing to consider whether there was some other basis in fact to find
    that breach of s. 61 of the <i>Competition
    Act</i>, breach of contract, and the existence of loss on a class wide basis
    were common issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority proceeded to a detailed analysis of the
    proposed common issues, (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f).  The majority concluded that these issues had a
    sufficient number of common elements to provide the basis for the certification
    of the class proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority also concluded that the motion judge erred
    in finding that s. 24 of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act</i> would not be available to determine aggregate damages at
    trial and he erred in finding that a class proceeding would not be the
    preferable procedure for the resolution of the common issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dissenting judge concluded that the motion judge
    came to the right result.  In her
    overview of the case she said at paras. 155 and 156:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[155]   I
    agree with the majority that a motions judge hearing a certification motion
    must ask whether there are any common issues, and then determine whether they
    are a substantial part of each class member’s claims.  In my view, that is what the motions judge
    did here, although his reasons might have been more detailed in order to
    illustrate his reasoning process more clearly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[156]   However,
    even if he erred in the way in which he approached the common issues as the
    majority finds, I see no basis to interfere with his conclusion that a class
    proceeding is not the preferable procedure.  He applied the correct legal principles, made no palpable and overriding
    errors of fact, and exercised his discretion based on the pleadings and
    evidence before him.  Therefore, I would
    dismiss the appeal.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi)      The

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>

    Standard of Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the majority’s reasons that they
    understood their role as an appellate court.  The majority recognized that a decision of a motion judge on
    certification is entitled to considerable deference.  See <i>Anderson
    v. Wilson</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 673 (C.A.) at 677 and <i>Cassano v. The Toronto Dominion Bank</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 401
    (C.A.).  However, as stated by Winkler
    C.J.O. in <i>Cassano</i> at para 23, “[L]egal
    errors by the motion judge on matters central to a proper application of s. 5
    of the <i>CPA</i> displace the deference
    usually owed to the certification motion decision…”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the Divisional Court
    majority erred in concluding that the motion judge failed to consider all the
    proposed common issues and then further erred in assuming original jurisdiction
    to decide those issues.  I disagree.  In my view, the majority correctly concluded
    that the focus of the motion judge’s reasons was on the issue of damages, which
    he found overwhelmed the remaining proposed common issues.  While he referred to the other issues in
    passing, there was effectively no independent analysis of those issues by the
    motion judge, which constitutes the kind of error that attracts the
    intervention of an appellate court. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated, the majority in the Divisional Court was
    critical of the motion judge for his focus on the problems associated with the
    proof of damages.  The majority concluded
    that the appropriate common issue was the breach of s. 61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i> and that such breach
    “may be approached in a number of ways”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority’s detailed analysis of s. 61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i> issue is found at paras.
    51 – 75 of their reasons.  I find it
    unnecessary to repeat that analysis here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court correctly concluded that breach of
    s. 61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i> does
    not require proof of loss or damage.  Likewise it does not, as alleged by the appellants, require detailed analysis
    of the prices paid for each product by each franchisee and the prices each
    franchisee would have paid but for the alleged maintenance agreements.  The section is aimed at attempts to maintain
    prices.  Loss of profit or damages is not
    a constituent element.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept the submission of the appellants that for the
    franchisees to succeed in their <i>Competition
    Act</i> claim, s. 61(1) must operate in combination with s. 36(1) of the act,
    which requires proof of loss or damage.  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> it does not detract from the
    conclusion that a breach of s. 61 is itself an appropriate common issue, which
    advances the litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am in agreement with the majority’s conclusions in
    the following paragraphs from their reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[67]     We
    agree with the appellants’ submission that a ‘top down’ approach focusing on
    the arrangement between the franchisor, the distributor and the suppliers, and
    the nature and amounts of the sourcing fees and mark-ups, may allow the court
    to determine <i>whether the mark-ups and
    sourcing fees resulted in maintaining prices contrary to s. 61(1)</i>.  This may ultimately allow the court to
    determine whether s. 61(1) was breached without the need to establish what each
    individual franchisee, acting alone, would pay for each product from an alternate
    supplier.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[68]     Whether
    or not evidence is available of prices before and after the distribution
    agreement or comparable industry practices need not be shown at the
    certification stage.  The requirement
    that there be some basis in fact to support the common issues does not require
    the plaintiffs to indicate the evidence to be advanced at the certification
    stage, nor does it determine the admissibility of evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[70]     If
    the court is satisfied that the Quiznos respondents imposed sourcing fees and
    mark-ups by way of the distribution agreement in an attempt to influence
    upwards the prices paid by the appellant franchisees, and that the pricing
    scheme resulted in a breach of s. 61(1), a substantial ingredient of liability
    under s. 36 of the <i>Competition Act</i> can be proven on a class wide basis.  This will advance the claim of each member of the class, and avoids the
    duplication of the legal analysis involved in determining this question.  Alternatively, a finding that the
    distribution agreement did not amount to price maintenance will resolve the
    litigation relating to both the <i>Competition
    Act</i> and the civil conspiracy claim.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>[Emphasis in the original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the above, I would add that it is unnecessary at
    this stage to engage in the debate about the relative strengths and weaknesses
    of the expert evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     The Conspiracy Claim</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As already noted, apart from the claims for punitive
    and exemplary damages, the conspiracy claim is the only claim that includes
    GFS.  The franchisees allege that price
    maintenance agreements pleaded in respect of the claim advanced under s. 61(1)
    and 36(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i> support
    a claim for the tort of civil conspiracy.  Paragraphs 62 and 63 of the Amended Amended Statement of Claim provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>62.       By
    entering into the Price Maintenance Agreements, and acting in furtherance of
    such agreements, each of the defendants entered into unlawful and tortious
    conspiracies to use unlawful means directed at the Class Members, knowing fully
    that their agreements and actions would cause injury to the Class Members,
    which injury has in fact resulted to the Class Members.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>63.       Furthermore,
    pursuant to the Price Maintenance Agreements and the acts particularized in
    paragraphs 31 to 42 hereof, the GFS companies have knowingly aided, abetted and
    counselled the Quiznos defendants in maintaining the prices at which the GFS
    companies have supplied or offered to supply products and supplies to the Class
    Members, which price maintenance is contrary to section 61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i> and which aiding,
    abetting and counselling is contrary to sections 21 and 22 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in the case of the s. 61(1) claim, the motion judge

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court in its analysis held that to

    elements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the respondents entered into an agreement (to
    permit the Quiznos respondents to enhance, fix and maintain prices to be paid

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the GFS respondents’ conduct (aiding and abetting
    price maintenance by the Quiznos respondents) is unlaw-ful;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the respondents acted in furtherance of the agree-ment;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the respondents should have known that the
    conspiracy would likely cause serious harm to the class members by forcing them
    to pay inflated prices for the goods; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>that</span> the conspiracy has caused

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court majority concluded at para. 81 of
    their reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given our conclusion that the fact of loss on a
    class wide basis is a common issue, we are satisfied that whether the
    respondents engaged in a civil conspiracy is a common issue.  However, even in the absence of proof of the
    fact of loss, the first four constituent elements of conspiracy are common
    issues that would advance each franchisee’s claim and avoid duplication of fact

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in respect of the <i>Competition Act</i> claim and the conspiracy claim, the appellants
    argue that the contract claims are highly individualistic and are not conducive
    to a determination on a class wide basis.  I am not persuaded.  I accept the
    Divisional Court majority’s conclusion at para. 93:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on the foregoing, we find that a significant
    number of factual and legal issues, integral to the breach of contract claim,
    are common issues.  These represent
    substantial ingredients of the breach of contract claim that could advance the
    claim of each class member and will avoid duplication of fact-finding or legal
    analysis.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(v)       Sections 23 and 24 of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the Divisional Court
    majority employed s. 23 to alter the constituent elements of the alleged causes
    of action by permitting the franchisees to establish damages on statistical
    probabilities or percentages.  The
    appellants further submit that the court’s right to make an aggregate
    assessment under s. 24(1) is only available after some liability and some
    entitlement are established – s. 24 merely provides a method to assess the
    quantum of damages on an aggregate basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellants have mischaracterized the approach
    that the majority of the Divisional Court took in the application of ss. 23 and
    24.  The majority clearly recognized that
    s. 24 is procedural and cannot be used in proving liability.  However, they observe that a breach of s.
    61(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i> and
    liability for breach of contract can be established without proof of loss.  The majority concluded at para. 123:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the appellants seek declaratory
    relief.  We have found that liability for
    breach of the <i>Competition Act</i> and
    liability for breach of contract are common issues.  Given our conclusions, ss. 23 and 24 of the <i>CPA</i> may be available at the common
    issues trial to determine damages on an aggregate basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judgment of this court in <i>Cassano</i> is supportive of the approach taken by the majority.  <i>Cassano</i> involved an action against the TD Bank by the proposed class action plaintiff
    for alleged manipulation of exchange rates on charges to the plaintiff’s Visa
    bill.  At para. 38, Winkler C.J.O.,
    writing for the court, said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, this is a case where the common issues
    trial judge could find, based on a review of the evidence, that it is
    appropriate to conduct an aggregate assessment of monetary relief under s. 24
    of the <i>CPA</i>, as was contemplated by
    this court in <i>Markson, supra</i>.  Alternatively, even if the trial judge were
    to conclude that an aggregate assessment of damages is inappropriate, the
    nature of the claim asserted is such that the provisions of the <i>CPA</i> might well be utilized so as to make
    a class proceeding under the statute the “preferable procedure for the
    resolution of the class members’ claims”: see <i>Hollick v. Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality)</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 158
    at para. 29.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The expert evidence before the motion judge goes to the issue
    of whether the damages can be aggregated as indicated in the above passage,
    which is an issue to be decided by the common issues trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Winkler C.J.O. adopted the approach taken by Cullity J.
    in <i>Vezina v. Loblaw Companies Ltd.</i>,
    [2005] O.J. No. 1974 at para. 25 (S.C.J.) and cited by Rosenberg J.A. in <i>Markson v. MBNA Canada Bank</i> (2007), 85
    O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) at para. 44 to the effect that on a certification motion,
    a plaintiff is only required to establish that “there is a reasonable
    likelihood that the preconditions in s. 24(1) of the <i>CPA</i> would be satisfied and an aggregate assessment made if the
    plaintiffs are otherwise successful at a trial for common issues.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Winkler C.J.O. at para. 52 of <i>Cassano</i> recognized that the ultimate
    decision of whether ss. 23 and 24 would be available rested with the trial
    judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even in the event that a trial judge were not
    prepared to rely on ss. 24(2) and (3) to fashion a remedial order in this case,
    I note that the combined operation of ss. 24(4), (5) and (6) of the <i>CPA</i> authorize the court to require that
    class members submit individual claims in order to give effect to an aggregate
    award of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add to the above that s. 25 of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> provides a
    procedural code for the determination of individual issues as an adjunct to a
    class proceeding.  It is clear that the
    intent of the act is to accommodate both common issues and individual issues
    that may arise in a class proceeding.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>(vi)      The</span></span><span lang=EN-US> Preferable Procedure</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely on the reasoning of the motion
    judge that the proposed class proceeding would not be fair, efficient or
    manageable because the individual issues “overwhelm” the common issues and the
    resolution of the common issues would not significantly advance the
    litigation.  I do not agree.  If one accepts, as I do, that the motion judge
    erred in his treatment of the common issues then the rationale for his conclusion
    that a class proceeding is not the preferable procedure disappears.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial of the common issues in this case
    will significantly advance the litigation.  I agree with the conclusion of the Divisional Court majority that this
    is the case even if the damages issues cannot be dealt with on a class wide
    basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am also of the view that a class proceeding in this
    case will satisfy at least two of the objectives of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> of judicial economy and access to
    justice.  It seems to me that this case
    involving a dispute between a franchisor and several hundred franchisees is
    exactly the kind of case for a class proceeding.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the parties cannot agree on costs, we will receive
