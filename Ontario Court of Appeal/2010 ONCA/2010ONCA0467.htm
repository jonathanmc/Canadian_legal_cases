  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Eastern Power Limited, is an independent
    producer of electrical power.  In 1994,
    Eastern Power signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Ontario Hydro, the
    predecessor of the respondent Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation.  Under the agreement, Eastern Power agreed to
    sell to Ontario Hydro, at specified rates, electricity generated from its
    landfill site in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    Vaughan,
    just north of the City of

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, Eastern Power sued Ontario Hydro, claiming
    that it committed numerous breaches of the power purchase agreement.  The trial took 23 days.  In a thorough and well-reasoned decision,
    Bellamy J. dismissed all of Eastern Power’s claims save one: a claim for an
    “inter-area transmission credit”.  The
    trial judge concluded that Ontario Hydro breached the power purchase agreement
    by failing to include a component for inter-area transmission in the rates it
    paid to Eastern Power.  However, the
    trial judge declined to award any damages for this breach of contract because
    she concluded that she had no reliable and credible evidence from which to
    calculate those damages.  She went on to
    say that, if she were wrong, she would award nominal damages of $5 million,
    inclusive of interest to the date of judgment, and a pro-rated amount for the remainder
    of the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern Power’s appeal is narrow.  It submits that the trial judge erred in law
    in not awarding damages for Ontario Hydro’s failure to include an inter-area
    transmission credit in the rates paid to Eastern Power.  It seeks an award of $8.5 million.  Alternatively, Eastern Power seeks a new
    trial or a reference on damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario Hydro defends the appeal by asserting that: (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) Eastern Power was not entitled to an inter-area
    transmission credit; (ii) the trial judge was correct to conclude she had no
    reliable and credible evidence to assess damages; and (iii) Eastern Power ought
    not to be allowed a second chance to prove damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal, therefore, raises these three issues: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)        Was the trial judge correct in concluding
    that Eastern Power was entitled to an inter-area transmission credit? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)        If the trial judge was correct, did she
    err in failing to award Eastern Power damages for breach of the power purchase
    agreement? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)        If the trial judge did not err, is
    Eastern Power entitled to a reference or a new trial on damages?</p>

    Hydro was created in 1906.  For the next
    75 years, it supplied all of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s
    electricity.  By the early 1980s,
    however,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s
    increasing demand for electricity began to overtake Ontario Hydro’s ability to
    satisfy it.  To meet the expected
    shortfall, Ontario Hydro contracted with private companies that generated
    electricity.  These private sources of
    electricity are called non-utility generators.  Eastern Power is one of many non-utility generators that have entered
    into supply agreements with Ontario Hydro.</span></p>

    Valley.  Although the offer was made on a take-it-or-leave-it
    basis, the parties bargained over its terms for seven months.  The power purchase agreement eventually signed
    in January 1994 incorporated many changes beneficial to Eastern Power,
    including over $3 million worth of betterments.  The agreement stipulated that Eastern Power would supply electricity to
    Ontario Hydro for 20 years.  </span></p>

    costs are costs that Ontario Hydro would have incurred to generate power if
    that power was not being supplied by a non-utility generator.  According to the evidence accepted by the
    trial judge, avoided costs did not represent a precise a number, but rather a
    median or average number drawn from a range of possibilities after taking into
    account several assumptions, inputs and values.  Importantly, Ontario Hydro did not disclose its avoided costs
    calculations to a non-utility generator.  To do so would reveal what the trial judge called Ontario Hydro’s
    “bottom line”.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless,
    at trial, Eastern Power contended that the phrase “based on Hydro’s avoided
    costs” meant <i>equal to</i> Hydro’s avoided
    costs.  In other words, Eastern Power argued
    that it was entitled to be paid rates equivalent to 100 per cent of Ontario
    Hydro’s avoided costs.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge rejected this contention. She concluded that the phrase “does not
    have independent contractual force or effect with respect to fixed dollar and
    cent rates in the agreement.”  Instead,
    the words were “there simply to set up the recalculation provision in the
    contract to show that avoided costs are a starting point or a foundation for
    the rate.”  The trial judge reasoned that
    Ontario Hydro always tried to pay rates that were lower than its avoided costs
    in order to obtain a cost benefit for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ratepayers.  </span>Her interpretation of
    the words “based on Hydro’s avoided costs” was not challenged on appeal.</p>

    clauses in the power purchase agreement stipulating that Eastern Power’s rates
    were “based on a Hydro’s avoided costs” gave Eastern Power the right to request
    that Ontario Hydro recalculate those rates.  The trial judge found – and her finding is not challenged on appeal –
    that Ontario Hydro had a duty to conduct the recalculation in good faith.  As I will discuss, the right to ask for a
    recalculation forms part of Eastern Power’s claim that the rates it was paid
    ought to have reflected an inter-area transmission credit.</span></p>

    component or input that Ontario Hydro used in its avoided costs calculations
    was an inter-area transmission credit.  This
    credit reflected Ontario Hydro’s assumption that non-utility generators
    supplying power to high demand areas produced greater avoided costs than those
    who did not.  By November 1992, Ontario
    Hydro provided an inter-area transmission credit to those projects that reduced
    electricity power loads in the greater

    costs calculations.  Ontario Hydro

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first branch of its submission, Ontario Hydro
    contends that an inter-area transmission credit is merely a component of its
    own internal avoided costs calculations. It is not referred to in the power
    purchase agreement, and therefore does not give rise to any contractual
    obligation on the part of Ontario Hydro or any contractual entitlement on the
    part of Eastern Power.  Ontario Hydro
    also contends that the trial judge erred in taking judicial notice that Eastern
    Power’s project was in the GTA, and that in the absence of evidence it was in
    the GTA, Eastern Power had no right to this credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario Hydro is correct in asserting that the power
    purchase agreement does not expressly refer to an inter-area transmission
    credit.  And the trial judge does not
    explicitly say why she concluded that Ontario Hydro’s failure to give this
    credit to Eastern Power amounted to a breach of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me, however, that the absence of an express
    reference in the agreement does not resolve the question of Eastern Power’s
    contractual entitlement to this credit.  I infer from the trial judge’s reasons that she viewed the relevant clause
    – “these rates are based on Hydro’s avoided costs” – as requiring Ontario
    Hydro’s rate calculations to incorporate all the various components, including
    credits, to which Eastern Power was entitled.  Thus, although the trial judge rejected the proposition that the clause
    dictated a particular rate, the clause nevertheless stipulated a “foundation”
    or “starting point” for the rates to be paid to Eastern Power.  That starting point had to embrace all the components
    of Ontario Hydro’s avoided costs calculations.  In an appropriate case, one of those components was an inter-area
    transmission credit.  Accordingly, if
    Eastern Power was entitled to this credit, Ontario Hydro was contractually obliged
    to take it into account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern Power was entitled to this credit if its

    197-199 of her reasons, the trial took judicial notice that Eastern Power’s
    project was in the GTA:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[197]   It is
    true that there was no evidence led at trial as to what regions were considered
    to be part of the greater Toronto area, either in 2007 or earlier in 1993.  The notion of an entity known as the GTA is
    relatively recent but, for many years now, it has found its way into everyday
    parlance in this community.  I am
    prepared to take judicial notice that in 2007 there are areas around Toronto
    that are known collectively as the GTA and that these areas include the regional
    municipalities of Durham, <span class=SpellE>Halton</span>, Peel, Toronto and
    York Region.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[199]   While
    there was no specific evidence about what constituted the GTA in 1993, there
    was evidence that when the contract between Hydro and Eastern Power received
    Order-in-Council approval in 1994, Hydro had already acknowledged, in writing,
    the existence of an entity known as the greater Toronto area.  I have no reason to believe that this entity
    did not include York Region then as it does now.  There was certainly no evidence to suggest

    would reduce Hydro’s load in the GTA, thereby affecting Hydro’s avoided costs.”  I see no error in her finding or in her
    conclusion.  Accordingly, I am not
    persuaded that the trial judge erred in holding that Eastern Power was
    contractually entitled to an inter-area transmission credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That brings me to the second branch of Ontario Hydro’s
    submission: its contention that even if Eastern Power was entitled to an
    inter-area transmission credit, it was not, as a result, entitled to higher
    rates.  Ontario Hydro argues that the
    trial judge had no evidence from which to conclude the rates paid to Eastern
    Power would have increased if an inter-area transmission credit was factored
    into the avoided costs calculations.  Ontario Hydro maintains this position because of its mandate to
    negotiate a ratepayer benefit for the people of

    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario Hydro’s contention runs up against the trial
    judge’s finding, at paras. 112-113 of her reasons, that the provision stating
    “these rates are based on Hydro’s avoided costs” and the provision giving
    Eastern Power the right to request a recalculation of those rates are
    connected.  If Ontario Hydro omitted to
    include in its avoided costs calculations a component it ought to have included,
    that omission would give Eastern Power the legitimate right to request a
    recalculation of its rates.  Ontario
    Hydro would then have a duty – as found by the trial judge – to conduct the
    recalculation in good faith.  Logically,
    this would mean that as Ontario Hydro’s avoided costs increased because of the
    credit, so too would the rates paid to Eastern Power.  To hold otherwise would render Eastern
    Power’s right of recalculation meaningless.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would not interfere with the trial
    judge’s finding that Ontario Hydro’s failure to give Eastern Power a credit for
    inter-area transmission amounted to a breach of the power purchase agreement

    agreement?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern Power called two witnesses on its damages claim:
    the company’s president, Greg Vogt, and an expert, Dr. Alan Rosenberg.  Ontario Hydro did not call any expert
    evidence on Eastern Power’s damages claim.  Instead, it maintained that Eastern Power had the onus of proving it had
    suffered a loss, and that it had not met this onus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge largely rejected the evidence of Mr.
    Vogt and Dr. Rosenberg.  She held that
    she could not rely on Mr. Vogt’s calculations and she did not trust Dr.
    Rosenberg’s opinions on damages.  She
    concluded, at para. 335 of her <span class=GramE>reasons, that</span> Eastern
    Power had presented her with “no reliable evidence... regarding the quantum of
    damages.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge relied on
    the judgment of this court in <i>Martin v.
    Goldfarb</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 161.  That
    case, as Finlayson J.A. noted at para. 74, “involves circumstances where, by
    the appellant’s own conduct, the court is not furnished with evidence necessary
    to properly dispose of the damages portion of the case.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of this passage from <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>, the trial judge held that she had “no choice”
    but to dismiss Eastern Power’s claim.  She went on to hold that if she were wrong in her interpretation of <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>, she would award
    nominal damages of $5 million, inclusive of interest up to the date of
    judgment, and a pro-rated amount for the remainder of the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern Power challenges the trial judge’s decision not
    to award damages.  Although framed in
    different ways, the essence of Eastern Power’s challenge is that once the trial
    judge found a breach of the agreement, she had a duty to assess damages
    “despite any difficulty in securing complete evidence or applying a mathematical
    measurement”.  Her failure to do so,
    according to Eastern Power, amounted to an error of law.  I generally agree with this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that the trial judge had a difficult
    problem.  She recognized that Eastern
    Power had expended considerable time and money in trying to prove its
    damages.  Yet she rejected as unreliable
    the damages evidence Eastern Power had put forward.  Without evidence she felt she could rely on,
    she resorted to the burden of proof and concluded that Eastern Power had not
    proven its damages on a balance of probabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge’s decision not to award
    damages is perhaps understandable, I find her resolution of this issue to be
    both unsatisfactory and inconsistent with what this court ultimately decided in <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s decision not to award damages is
    unsatisfactory for at least two reasons.  First, Eastern Power undoubtedly incurred a significant loss as a result
    of Ontario Hydro’s breach of the agreement.  That it did so can be seen in the alternative relief the trial judge
    awarded – a “nominal” damages award in excess of $5 million.  An amount of this magnitude goes well beyond what
    we normally think of nominal damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, proving damages in this case was no easy
    task.  At a minimum, a credit for
    inter-area transmission had to be factored into Ontario Hydro’s avoided costs
    calculations for Eastern Power’s project, and the resulting increase in avoided
    costs had to be translated into a reasonable rate increase.  Yet all the raw data, information and
    methodologies required <span class=GramE>to do</span> an avoided costs
    calculation belonged to Ontario Hydro.  And Ontario Hydro refused to produce its own calculation of the damages
    Eastern Power would have suffered from Hydro’s failure to include a credit for
    inter-area transmission.  In the light of
    these two circumstances, it strikes me as unjust to deny Eastern Power an award
    of damages for Ontario Hydro’s breach of the agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I do not consider the trial judge’s refusal
    to award damages to be faithful to this court’s decision in <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>.  In that case, the plaintiff, Martin, sued his
    lawyer and the lawyer’s law firm for damages arising from a breach of fiduciary
    duty.  The trial judge found a breach of
    duty and awarded Martin substantial damages.  This court set aside the trial judge’s award.  Finlayson J.A. held that the award was
    speculative and lacked adequate supporting evidence.  In so concluding, he distinguished two
    classes of cases, at para. 75:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The distinction … is that where the assessment is
    difficult because of the nature of the damage [to be] proved, the difficulty of
    assessment is no ground for refusing substantial damages even to the point of
    resorting to guess work.  However, where
    the absence of evidence makes it impossible to assess damages, the litigant is
    entitled to nominal damages at best.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first category, Finlayson J.A. observed, at
    para. 74:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For example, a future contingency which cannot be
    accurately characterized and calculated should not prevent the award of
    substantial damages where a breach has been made out and damages flowing from
    that breach have been established to the satisfaction of the court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Finlayson J.A.’s opinion, however, Martin’s claim
    fell into the second category:  cases
    where assessment is “impossible” because evidence is “available but not
    adduced”.  Martin’s approach to damages
    was “misguided” because he equated his personal losses to those suffered by his
    corporations, effectively jumping ahead of all other creditors involved in the
    company’s bankruptcy proceedings.  As a
    consequence of Martin’s strategy, this court held that he called no evidence
    from which his personal losses could be assessed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet this court did not award Martin nominal damages,
    nor did it deny him recovery altogether.  Instead, recognizing that the personal damages Martin suffered were
    substantial, the court ordered a new trial on damages to permit him to prove
    his personal losses.  In other words, the
    significant loss Martin incurred outweighed his failure to adduce evidence of
    that loss, and entitled him to something more than nominal damages.  This is the interpretation of <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i> recently adopted by
    this court in <span class=SpellE><i>Rosenhek</i></span><i> v. Windsor Regional Hospital </i>(2010),
    257 O.A.C. 283:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[37] In <i>Martin</i>,
    Finlayson J.A. drew a distinction between damages that are difficult in nature
    to assess, an assessment that must be undertaken despite the need for “guess
    work”, and damages that are unproven due to a failure to adduce available
    evidence.  In the latter case, only
    nominal damages should be awarded.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[38] However, even in <i>Martin</i>, Finlayson J.A. declined to award nominal damages based on
    insufficient support for the damage claim; instead, he referred the damages
    back to the trial judge on the grounds that the plaintiff had adduced enough
    evidence to prove a significant loss.  The principle appears to be that nominal damages are not appropriate
    where a substantial loss has been demonstrated, even if evidence proving
    quantum is lacking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that Eastern Power’s damages claim does
    not fit easily into either category Finlayson J.A. described in <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>.  While the claim was inherently difficult to
    assess – indeed, one cannot determine exactly how much the rates would have
    increased if the parties had used the higher avoided costs figure as the
    starting point in their negotiations – the quantum could nevertheless have been
    estimated within a relatively narrow range if the court was assisted by
    reliable experts.  Seen in this way, the claim
    may not be quite as nebulous as some of the future contingencies contemplated
    by Finlayson J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the absence of evidence in the case before us
    does not stem from a failure to adduce evidence.  In <i>Martin
    v. Goldfarb, </i>Martin’s “shoddy proffer of evidence” on the question of
    personal damages was a direct result of mischaracterizing his claim in a
    different, more favourable light (as damages of his corporations)<i>.</i>  Eastern Power, by contrast, did not fail to
    adduce evidence.  Nor did it frame its damages
    claim in an inappropriate or misleading manner.  Eastern Power attempted to resolve the
    inherently complicated and highly technical question of damages by tendering the
    evidence of its president and one qualified expert witness.  The trial judge’s conclusion that she had no
    credible evidence on damages reflected her view that Eastern Power’s witnesses
    were unreliable, not Eastern Power’s failure to adduce any evidence on the
    issue.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Martin and Eastern Power suffered substantial
    losses.  Despite Martin’s failure to adduce
    evidence on the proper damages question, this court did not deny him
    compensation, but instead allowed him an opportunity to make out his damages
    claim.  Eastern Power should not be put in
    a worse position for its attempt to address the complicated question of damages
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario Hydro relies on this court’s decision in <i>Lombardo v. <span class=SpellE>Caiazzo</span> </i>(2006), 211 O.A.C. 270 for the proposition that a plaintiff ought not to be
    provided with a second opportunity to prove the damages they attempted to show
    at trial.  In my view, the holding in <i>Lombardo </i>does not apply.  That case concerned an action for the tort of
    conspiracy, which includes proof of damages as an essential element for
    establishing liability.  The appellants
    had their action dismissed at trial because they had not proven the damages
    element of the conspiracy tort, and unsuccessfully sought to challenge that
    finding on appeal.  As Gillese J.A.
    explicitly notes in her reasons, however, the issue of whether the elements of
    a tort are made out is conceptually distinct from difficulties in proving the
    quantum of damages once liability for a civil wrong is established:  see para. 17.  On this latter point, <i>Lombardo</i> does not change the existing jurisprudence, including <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore conclude that Eastern Power is entitled to
    be compensated for breach of the power purchase agreement.  How then does the court give effect to this
    conclusion?  As I see it, we have three
    options: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) assess Eastern Power’s damages
    ourselves; (ii) substitute the trial judge’s “nominal” damages award; or (iii) order
    a new trial on damages.  Eastern Power
    submits that we ought to assess damages.  It argues that we have the necessary uncontested data to arrive at a
    reasonable figure.  It asks for $8.5
    million, which it says is the mid-point of the range established by the
    uncontested evidence.  Alternatively,
    Eastern Power asks that we order a new trial on damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court is not in a position to assess damages.  We have heard and reviewed but a snippet of a
    long trial involving complicated and highly technical evidence.  Even if the raw data on which Eastern Power
    relies is uncontested, we have no reliable methodology to do the necessary
    calculations from that data.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That leaves the options of substituting the trial
    judge’s “nominal” damages award or ordering a new trial.  Substituting the nominal damages award is an
    attractive option.  The award of $5
    million, inclusive of interest to the date of judgment, and a pro-rated amount for
    the remainder of the contract, effectively amounts to approximately $7 million
    – a figure not far below the amount Eastern Power seeks.  This award likely represents the trial
    judge’s estimation of the loss, albeit discounted in Eastern Power’s view.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Substituting the trial judge’s “nominal” damages award
    may not be a perfect solution, but it does have practical advantage of avoiding
    further litigation, which inevitably would be costly and time consuming.  Still, in principle and consistent with <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i>, Eastern Power is
    entitled to a new trial on damages, and that is the option I would order.</p>
