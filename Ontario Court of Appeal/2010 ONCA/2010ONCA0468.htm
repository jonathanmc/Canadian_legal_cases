    <span lang=EN-US>I.</span>          <span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Landlord and Tenant Board dismissed the appellants’
    application for a determination that the <i>Residential
    Tenancies Act</i>, <i>2006</i>, S.O. 2006,
    c.17 (the Act) applied to their land lease community.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional
    Court dismissed the appellants’ appeal.  The appellants further appeal to this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 210 of the Act provides a right to appeal an
    order of the Board to the Divisional Court, but only on a question of law.  After argument, counsel provided further
    submissions concerning whether this appeal raises a question of law, fact, or
    mixed fact and law and whether the Board member’s decision is entitled to
    deference.  We are grateful for and have
    considered those submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that deference is owed to a tribunal’s decision
    that is based on the interpretation of its home statute, in my view deference
    is not owed in the circumstances of this case.  In this case, the decision was based on dictionary definitions of
    “residence” and did not reflect a nuanced approach based on Board member’s expertise.  As well, the Board member considered himself to
    be bound by the decision of the Divisional Court in <i>Wheeler v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    (Minister of Natural Resources) </i>(2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 113.  Accordingly, in my
    view, the decision is not entitled to deference. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also conclude that this appeal, as it did before the
    Divisional Court, raises a question of law: namely, the proper interpretation
    of provisions of the Act.  The primary
    issue is the interpretation to be given to “residential”, in the context in
    which that term is used in the Act.  In
    my view, consideration of the term “residential” leads to the interpretation
    that all residential properties, including those used by tenants for
    recreational as well as residential purposes, are subject to the Act<i>.</i>    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The secondary issue is whether the Act gives the
    Landlord and Tenant Board the jurisdiction to exempt landlords from their
    statutory and regulatory responsibilities for the provision and maintenance of
    services to a residential unit.  On this
    issue, I would conclude that the Board does not have that jurisdiction.    </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts are not in dispute.  The appellants each leased lots roughly one
    acre in size in a lake area north of Sault Ste. Marie.  Lots were initially leased from Algoma
    Central Railway (ACR), mostly in the 1970s and 1980s.  While there were a number of forms of lease,
    and many appear to be of indefinite duration, the unchallenged evidence of the
    individual most familiar with all the leases was that “all recreational leases
    were written … with a 20 year less a day lease, with a [renewable] term of one
    year.”  The length of the lease was in
    keeping with ACR’s stated intention that the lessees erect structures of a
    permanent nature with a specified minimum value within 2 years of the
    initiation of the lease.  The leases
    stipulated modest rents, which were subject to an annual rent increase in
    keeping with the annual inflation rate reflected in the Consumer Price
    Index.  Lessees renewed their leases simply
    by paying the increased rent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ACR provided potential lessees with a document entitled
    “Information for Lessees in Algoma Central Country”, which referred to lessees’
    building “residences” on the sites.  Other
    documents referred to building a “camp for private purposes” or “your own
    cottage” or a “private use recreational camp”.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certain versions of later leases purported to provide
    that no residence constructed on the land would be “used or occupied as residential
    premises” or a “rental unit” under the applicable residential landlord tenant
    regime.  The rental documentation allowed
    lessees to sell the buildings they built on the sites and to sublet their
    “private recreational leases ... provided it [did] not create a continually
    commercial operation.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the sites rented, ACR informed the lessees about
    township requirements.  The ACR brochure
    specifically addressed the need for a lessee to apply to the “appropriate
    Health Authority” regarding approval for sewage disposal and required the
    lessees to “conform <span class=GramE>with</span> all local health
    regulations.”  A 1988 document, entitled
    “General Information for Lessees on Railway Lands”, detailed the requirements
    for lot, privy, and septic tank setbacks, for installation of leaching pits for
    kitchen waste and for garbage disposal.  In executing the leases, the lessees were bound by a term that generally
    required them to comply with all site-related statutory provisions and
    government regulations.  Lessees were
    also informed of the need for work permits to clear land and construct cabins,
    as well as the need for a fire permit for certain times of year.  As described by Heeney J., the landlord
    provided no “road maintenance, road access, dock maintenance, sewage and
    garbage disposal, snow plowing, electrical and water infrastructure, ... [or]
    potable water”.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sites were largely accessible to the lessees only
    by railway, logging road, boat or all-terrain vehicle.  As a result, the cottages on the sites were
    built “with blood, sweat and tears”.  They were described in evidence as “attractive, solid, stable buildings”
    and by property inspectors, Elliott Engineering, as “built for the long term to
    be used all year.”  Most of the cottages
    were insulated and heated for winter use.  Photographs of the appellants’ cottages showed they were largely carefully
    constructed dwellings of significant substance.  The evidence indicated that the cottages
    contained the usual amenities for a northern
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario camp, including living quarters, bedrooms,
    kitchens and decks.  Each camp had an
    outhouse that was compliant with township requirements.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the leases provided that the sites could not “be
    used for continuous year-round habitation”, and later described their use to be
    “seasonal”, the unchallenged evidence of the ACR representative was that the
    cottages were “used at all times of the year, during vacations, holidays,
    weekends, etc.”  The landlord never
    restricted access, seasonally or otherwise.  However, the sites could become inaccessible during periods of spring
    break-up or fall freeze-up.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While at their cottages, the lessees pursued activities
    that the Board member found to include “family celebrations, sports, reading,
    playing games, walks, television viewing etc.”  Virtually all the lessees, including the appellants, maintained a
    principal residence elsewhere.  In other
    words, the lessees used the cottages as their secondary homes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By December 2005, when Algoma Timberlakes Corporation
    (Timberlakes) acquired the property, the annual rent had increased to between approximately
    $500 to $775, depending on the size and location of the site.  After Timberlakes took ownership, it sent
    eviction notices to those lessees who held sites north of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Batchawana
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    and gave notices of rent increase to those lessees who held sites south of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Batchawana
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    River.  The notices proposed significantly increased rents to roughly $2,000 per
    lot per year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Timberlakes also purported to replace the leases with
    “licenses” and to change the status of the lessees to that of licensees.  The proposed licence agreements gave
    Timberlakes an unfettered discretion whether to renew the licence upon its
    annual expiration.  The proposed
    licensees were expected to acknowledge that there would be no permanent structures
    on what the draft licence described as “seasonal, recreational campsite(s)” and
    that, at the end of the licence term, the lessees had 30 days to remove their
    cottages.  The Timberlakes proposal of a
    licence system and rent increase led to the application to the Board and to this
    appeal. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The purposes of this Act are to provide protection
    for residential tenants from unlawful rent increases and unlawful evictions, to
    establish a framework for the regulation of residential rents, to balance the
    rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants and to provide
    for the adjudication of disputes and for other processes to informally resolve
    disputes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1) provides that the Act applies to “rental
    units”.  The parties agree that the
    premises are land lease homes in a land lease community to which the Act
    applies, provided the premises are otherwise “rental units”.  Section 2(1) defines “rental unit” as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>any</span> living accommodation
    used or intended for use as rented residential premises, and “rental unit”
    includes,</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>“Rent” is defined in the same section

    unit”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5 describes living accommodation to which the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>living</span> accommodation
    intended to be provided to the travelling or vacationing public or occupied for
    a seasonal or temporary period in a hotel, motel or motor hotel, resort, lodge,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1) provides that the Act applies “despite any
    agreement or waiver to the contrary”. Section 4 states that “a provision in a
    tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with this Act or the regulations is
    void.”   Section 202 directs the Board to
    “ascertain the real substance of all transactions and activities relating to
    ... a rental unit”.  Section 202 further
    provides that the Board may (a) “disregard the outward form of a transaction”
    and (b) “have regard to the pattern of activities relating to the ... rental

    purposes is to protect residential tenants from unlawful rent increases and
    evictions.  The Honourable R. Roy
    McMurtry, the Attorney General at the time, explained that the purpose behind
    extending the application of these protections to mobile homes (and later to land
    lease sites) was to provide tenants of those premises with security of tenure
    and other protections that had been available to other tenants.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  To ensure that protection, the legislation
    provided a broad definition of a “rental unit”.</span></p>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rental Unit</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The definition of a “rental unit” in s. 2(1) contains
    two components.  First, the unit must be
    “living accommodation”.  Second, it must
    be used or intended for use as “rented residential premises”.  As I have indicated, s. 3(1) provides that
    the Act applies despite any term in the lease to the contrary and s. 4 provides
    that “a provision in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with this Act or
    the regulations is void.”  Section 202
    requires the Board to “ascertain the real substance of the activities” relating
    to the rental unit and to do so disregarding “the outward form of [the]
    transaction”.  Accordingly, a term in the
    lease providing that a site is not residential nor a rental unit will not have
    the effect of avoiding the application of the Act, provided that the premises
    otherwise fit within the statutory definition of a “rental unit”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the undisputed facts demonstrate that the
    premises constituted “living accommodation”.  The lessees’ families lived in the cottages.  All the cottages contained sleeping and
    living quarters as well as kitchen facilities.  All were equipped with outhouses approved by the public health
    authority.  Families attended at these
    cottages for varying periods of time at different times of the year.  During their stays, the lessees carried on
    the normal activities of persons living in accommodation.  In these circumstances, it seems the cottages
    unequivocally satisfy the first requirement of being “living accommodation”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the second requirement, that the premises <span
class=GramE>be</span> used or intended for use as “rented residential premises”,
    is also satisfied.  Certainly, the
    lessees paid rent to “occupy” the land upon which they constructed their
    cottages.  Thus, they were “rented”
    premises.  In addition, in my view, the
    premises were clearly “residential” as that term is used in the Act.  They certainly were not “commercial”.  The documentation demonstrates ACR’s
    intention that the “camps” were leased for single-family private use and not as
    commercial campsite enterprises.  “Commercial”
    tenancies are dealt with separately in the ACR documentation and are governed
    by different legislative provisions.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional
    Court was of the view that because the premises
    were used for recreational purposes they are not “residential”.  Yet there is no Recreational Tenancies Act.  And the <i>Residential
    Tenancies Act</i> makes no reference to “recreational” premises as a separate
    category of living accommodation.  Although
    s. 5 of the Act contains a list of specific exemptions, there is no blanket exemption
    of, or any reference to, “recreational” properties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, occupants of residential units are entitled
    to the protection of the Act, whatever they do inside or outside of their
    premises during their waking hours. The Act applies whether the occupants spend
    their days at work or at leisure, whether they live in their accommodation 52
    weeks a year or some lesser amount of time, and whether the unit in question is
    their primary or secondary residence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, a person primarily residing
    elsewhere who rents a city apartment for convenience, as a <i>pied-à-terre</i>, or as any type of secondary residence, would be
    denied the tenant protections that would be available to his or her neighbour
    across the hall.  As well,
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario tenants who
    “reside” in warmer locations as “snowbirds” during the winter months could lose
    the tenant protections available to them under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario law.  Moreover, individuals who rent premises in locations such as Collingwood
    for golf and skiing would be denied the protections provided by the Act because
    they would be occupying the premises for “recreational” rather than
    “residential” purposes.  In my view,
    there can be no difference between the Collingwood residential and “recreational”
    rental apartment from which the occupant has access to golf and skiing and the
    ACR residential and “recreational” rental premises from which the occupant has
    access to fishing and hunting.  The
    recreational attributes of the particular area do not mean that the rental units
    are not residential within the meaning of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Board and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court majority were diverted
    from their task by the submission that the cottage sites were “recreational”
    and by their conclusion that recreational use precluded the premises from
    fitting within the “residential” definition of a rental unit.  This conclusion was based on the reliance by
    both the member and the majority in the Divisional Court on the definitions of
    “residence” and “recreational camp” found in D.A. Dukelow, <i>The</i> <i>Dictionary of Canadian
    Law</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2004).  These definitions are not helpful.  In my view, it is the legislative definition
    rather than the dictionary definitions that must prevail in this case.  This view is supported by a further entry in
    the same dictionary, which provides a separate and distinct definition for
    “residential unit” as encompassing “any living accommodation used or intended
    for use as residential premises”.  This
    definition cites the <i>Tenant Protection Act,
    1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c. 24 in support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The governing legislative definition of “rental unit” asks
    whether the premises are used as residential premises, and not what other
    activities are carried on by the person residing in the premises.  What a particular tenant does while living in
    residential premises is irrelevant to the question of whether those premises
    are entitled to the protection of the Act.  As J. deP. Wright J. observed in his concurring reasons, the argument
    that the appellants used their cottages for recreation, but not as their
    residences, “is bound to leave lay-people such as the appellants shaking their
    heads in wonder.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the legislation is to provide
    protections to tenants.  There is no
    reason to exclude tenants who have a penchant for recreation and spending time
    with their families in the outdoors.  Indeed,
    if it had been the legislature’s intention to exclude recreational units from
    the Act, it could have added living accommodation occupied for “recreational”
    purposes to the s. 5 list of premises to which the Act does not apply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Timberlakes points to the exclusion, contained in s.
    5(a), of premises “provided to the travelling or vacationing public or occupied
    for a seasonal or temporary period in a hotel, motel or motor hotel, resort,
    lodge, tourist camp, cottage or cabin establishment, inn, campground, trailer
    park, tourist home, bed and breakfast vacation establishment or vacation
    home”.  In particular, Timberlakes argues
    both that the lessees occupy the premises for a “temporary period”, and that
    the premises are a “resort”, “<span class=GramE>campground</span>” or “vacation
    home”.  I do not accept either argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in my view, the undisputed evidence is that the
    premises were occupied for more than a temporary period and for more than a
    seasonal period.  The premises were
    occupied over many seasons, months and years.  The evidence establishes that the leases were intended to be continually
    renewed over a long period of time.  Moreover, all the leases provided for payment of rent on an annual
    basis.  There was no seasonal or
    temporary rental rate.  Accordingly, in
    my view, the s. 5(a) exclusion regarding “seasonal or temporary” occupation does
    not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, even if it could be found that occupation was
    for a seasonal or a temporary period, the category of premises at issue in this
    case is quite different from the living accommodations specifically excluded by
    s. 5(a) of the Act.  Regarding the
    applicability of what was s. 3(a) of the then <i>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</i>, the Divisional Court in <i>Putnam v. Grand River Conservation Authority</i> (2006), 210 O.A.C. 291, at para. 25,<i> </i>cited
    with approval the reasoning of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    Rental Housing Tribunal regarding rented “cottage” lots:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The
    listing of places where this seasonal or temporary accommodation is to take
    place clearly is a listing of places, owned by private persons or businesses,
    which appeal to the general public as vacation spots or places to stay when one
    is away from home. They represent accommodation for travellers, for
    vacationers, for anyone who needs temporary accommodation provided by someone
    other than themselves.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The
    Tribunal accepts that the phrase ‘in a ... cottage or cabin establishment’ in
    Section 3(a) should be interpreted to mean that the grouping of cottages or
    cabins (the establishment) available as seasonal or temporary accommodation is
    analogous to the rooms in a hotel or a motel, or the rooms in a ‘bed and
    breakfast’ or in an inn, or the sites at a campground or in a trailer park,
    available as living accommodation to be occupied for a seasonal or temporary
    period. To interpret otherwise would be to ‘hive off’ this particular phrase
    from the listing in Section 3(a) and give it a completely different
    interpretation from the other words and phrases in the listing.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo>Similarly, the accommodation in this case was not akin to the hotel,
    resort, campground, or vacation home temporary lodgings that the legislature intended
    to exclude from the application of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded otherwise by the decision of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court in <i>Wheeler</i>, which the Board member in
    this case considered to be binding.  In
    my view, that decision rested on the primary ground that the Act did not apply
    to property owned by the provincial Crown.  Moreover, the <i>obiter</i> in
    paragraph 13 of <i>Wheeler</i> concerning
    “recreation properties” was not accompanied by an exercise of statutory
    interpretation that included an analysis of the Act or its purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, in my view, the term “residential”
    in the Act refers to the residential use of the premises and the Act does not
    provide <span class=GramE>a blanket</span> exclusion for recreational
    properties.  There being no dispute about
    the facts, I conclude that the lessees’ sites are subject to the Act. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants seek a declaration under s. 9(1<span

    obligations under ss. 20 and 161 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, Heeney J. correctly concluded that s. 9(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) does not give the Board jurisdiction to grant a
    landlord a statutory exemption.  As
    Heeney J. explained: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This submission ... would give the Board the power
    to pick and choose what obligations to impose on a landlord in any given case,
    based entirely on its own discretion.  It
    would render uncertain the entire application of the Act, since neither tenants
    nor landlords would know what their rights and obligations were until the Board
    exercised its discretion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This section is clearly intended to give the Board
    the power to determine whether any particular provision applies to any
    particular situation, based on an analysis and application of the provisions
    and definitions contained in the Act....  Section 9(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) is not intended to give the
    Board unfettered discretion to relieve landlords from the obligations imposed
    by the RTA, such as those found in sections 20 and 161.  Jurisdiction to exempt the landlord from its
    obligations could only flow from the provisions of the RTA itself, and there is
    no section in the Act that provides for this.  Indeed, s. 3(1) prevents even the parties themselves from agreeing to
    exempt the landlord from these obligations.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I do not agree with Heeney J.’s conclusion
    that the landlord’s responsibilities as set out in the Act bolster the position
    that the Act was not intended to “fit” the properties that are the subject of
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that as a practical matter, ss. 20 and 161
    of the Act may present challenges when applied to both the usual urban
    apartment complex and to land lease communities of the nature of those
    described in this proceeding.  The
    practical differences between urban rental units and land lease and mobile home
    units have long been recognized.  Despite
    this recognition, the legislature has chosen to leave land lease regulation
    within the current framework that applies equally to all residential units.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the application of the current framework to
    the appellants’ premises may not impose as “onerous” a burden upon the landlord
    as the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    assumed.   While the obligations under s. 161 were relied
    on before the Board, s. 161(a) only requires the landlord to “ensur[e] the
    availability of a means for removing or disposing of garbage”.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a>  The evidence in this case shows that the
    landlord required the lessees to assume responsibility for garbage and other
    regulatory requirements.  Subsections
    (b), (d) and (e) of s. 161 appear to require a landlord to maintain services only
    if those services have already been provided.  The snow removal requirement of s. 161(c) presumes that there are roads
    in the land lease community from which snow must be removed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Divisional Court observed, obligations are also
    imposed on a landlord by the maintenance standards set out in O. Reg. 517/06.  Section 2(2) of the maintenance standards
    states, “E<span style='line-height:200%'>xcept as
    otherwise provided, the landlord shall ensure that the maintenance standards in
    this Regulation are complied with.”  Again,
    this provision does not oblige the landlord to meet standards, but only to
    ensure compliance with them.  Similarly,
    certain </span>of the regulatory standards provide that the landlord “maintain”
    a standard; they do not require a landlord to provide a service that did not
    exist in the first place.  For example,
    while s. 10(1) of the Regulation requires that every rental unit contain
    certain kitchen and bathroom fixtures, s. 10(4) provides that this requirement does
    not apply where the premises have “never been provided with piped water.”  Similarly, s. 14(5) does not require the
    provision of electricity to a “residential complex that has <span
style='line-height:200%'>never been connected to an
    electrical power system.”  </span>In any
    event, any failure by a landlord to ensure the required compliance would not be
    relevant to the interpretation of the term “residential”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the service provisions of the Act and the
    Regulation do not persuade me to a different interpretation of the term
    “residential”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is a separate question whether a
    particular service must be provided by the landlord.  The answer to that question depends upon a
    proper construction of the Act applied to the particular facts of these land
    lease homes.  This is a matter that may
    be decided by the Board on a separate application on proper materials. </p>
