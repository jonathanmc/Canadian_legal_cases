  <h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Background</span></h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Tremblay and his next-door neighbours – the
    complainants, Pierre Huppé and Deanna Perry – were engaged in an un-neighbourly
    dispute.  The dispute had its origins in
    some flood damage that occurred on the Hupp&#279;/Perry property and that they
    attributed to run-off from a drain Mr. Tremblay had installed on his property
    when constructing his house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ill-will developed between the neighbours and the
    dispute festered over a number of years, starting in 2003.  In 2004 Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry decided to
    list their property for sale, but they encountered serious difficulties in
    marketing it, and by the <span class=GramE>Fall</span> of 2006 had still not
    found a purchaser.  In the meantime, the
    dispute had escalated further with the commencement of a civil suit by the
    complainants against Mr. Tremblay in May of that year.  Although Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry had a litany
    of complaints about the conduct of Mr. Tremblay which formed the basis of their
    civil action, and of the subsequent criminal proceedings providing the
    framework for this appeal, the conduct that is central to the appeal began in
    September, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 27, 2006, in an apparent display of pique,
    Mr. Tremblay placed his old rusted and beat-up van on the grass alongside the
    property line he shared with his neighbours.  He threw three old tires on top of the van and left one on the hood,
    leaning against the front window.  Needless to say, this was an eyesore, visible to anyone, and
    particularly to potential buyers coming to view the complainants’ home.  Then, on October 9 – shortly after Mr. Huppé
    and Ms. Perry’s realtor posted a sign on their front lawn advertising an open
    house for the upcoming weekend – Mr. Tremblay spray painted, in fluorescent
    orange paint, the words, “I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR BASEMENT FLOODS,” on the
    side of the van facing his neighbour’s property.   On the theory that a picture is worth at
    least a page of words, I attach a photo of the offending van as Appendix “A” to
    these reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of these actions, the complainants
    cancelled their open house.  A few days
    later, at the request of Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry through their civil counsel
    and on the advice of his own, Mr. Tremblay removed the van.  Ultimately, the complainants sold their house
    and moved out in January 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For this conduct Mr. Tremblay was found guilty in the
    Ontario Court of Justice of the offence of mischief for his wilful interference
    with his neighbour’s lawful use and enjoyment of their property, and was granted a
    conditional discharge.  Justice Wake
    acquitted him on four companion counts of watching and besetting (x2) and
    criminal harassment (x2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Tremblay’s summary conviction appeal from the
    finding of guilt was dismissed by Justice Power in Superior Court.  He now seeks leave to appeal, and if leave is
    granted, appeals from the finding of guilt.  For the reasons that follow, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues and Findings Below</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Tremblay argues that even though his acts may have
    interrupted or interfered with his neighbour’s lawful use and enjoyment of
    their property, he is nonetheless entitled to rely upon the defence provided by
    subsection 430(7) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> because his actions were only for the purpose of communicating information.  The issue on the appeal is the scope and
    interpretation of that defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown accepts that the proposed appeal raises a
    question of law of sufficient significance that leave to appeal should be
    granted in accordance with the principles set out in <i>Regina v. R.(R.)</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.).  I agree and would therefore grant leave to
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made the following unchallenged
    findings of fact:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Mr. Tremblay has] provided the Court with an
    explanation concerning the van, and it was that he simply wanted to communicate
    a message to the complainants.  He
    admitted that he was frustrated over the lawsuit and he conceded in
    cross-examination that he hoped it would provoke a reaction from the
    complainants that would lead to the withdrawal of their lawsuit, at least in
    relation to the flooding portion of their complaint.  When further pressed, he indicated that he
    wanted a message to go out that these were dishonest people, referring to the
    complainants, because of the allegations they had made in their lawsuit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’ll deal with the mischief count first, and
    without making any findings in relation to the other allegations, I am able to
    say that it is clear that there was some degree of ill will between the parties
    since the complaint was made to the City concerning the French drain in 2003.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This was accentuated in May of 2006 when the
    lawsuit was filed.  I find it difficult
    to believe the defendant when he testified in cross-examination that he had no
    animosity to the complainants, and that he was only saddened by them, and at
    worst frustrated by their actions.  This
    is to be stacked up against the fact that he would go to the lengths he did, to
    place, what can only be termed an eyesore, against the property line, and with
    his evidence that he wanted to send a message that the complainants were
    dishonest people.  In short, I do not
    believe his evidence in that regard.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He was aware that the complainants had been trying
    to sell their property for some time, and that they had frequent open
    houses.  In fact, as already indicated,
    he attended one of them.  I have no doubt
    that by placing his van with spray paint, in the words [“I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE
    FOR YOUR BASEMENT FLOODS”], that he intended to affect the ability of the
    complainants to display their house, and to draw their attention to the
    flooding problem that they had experienced in their home, in an attempt to get
    the complainants to withdraw their lawsuit, at least in relation to the
    flooding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded on those facts that Mr. Tremblay’s conduct
    interfered with the lawful enjoyment by Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry of their
    property (s. 430(1)), the trial judge went on to consider the s. 430(7)
    defence.  After reviewing the
    jurisprudence provided to him (picketing cases, to which I will return momentarily),
    he rejected the application of the defence, based on the following finding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect, I cannot see that the action of Mr.
    Tremblay, of placing his aged van with the tires removed and placed on the
    roof, next to the property line, in order to attract attention to it, and
    thereby rendering it to be an eyesore, and then spray painting his defiant
    message, <i>had anything to do with
    communicating information in order to persuade by rational argument</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Power J. concluded that Justice Wake had
    erred by qualifying and restricting the scope of the s. 430(7) defence to
    situations where information is communicated “in order to persuade by rational
    argument.”  However, he agreed with the
    trial judge’s ultimate finding that Mr. Tremblay was not entitled to rely on
    the defence.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The facts, as found by Justice Wake, clearly
    justify his conclusion that the accused placed an eyesore near the
    complainants’ property for the purpose of sending a message that the
    complainants were dishonest people and, as well, to negatively affect their
    ability to display and sell their home.  His further intention, as found by the trial judge, was that he was
    attempting to draw attention to prospective purchasers of a flooding problem
    connected to the complainants’ property.  His motive, of course, was to attempt to have them withdraw the whole or
    part of their lawsuit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… <span class=GramE>it</span> is clear to me that the appellant did not attend at or near the complainants’
    house for the purpose only of communicating information.  I agree with [Crown counsel’s] argument that
    we are not here simply concerned with communication of information... No <i>Charter</i> challenge has been made to
    either subsection (1) or (7) of s. 430 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Therefore, in
    my opinion, it is not possible for the appellant simply to overlay, as he does,
    s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> on top of
    subsection (7) of s. 430 of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Relevant Provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsections 430(1) and (7) of the Criminal Code state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>430(1) <span class=GramE>Every</span> one commits mischief
    who wilfully</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) <span class=GramE>obstructs</span>,
    interrupts or interferes with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of
    property; …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(7) No person commits mischief within the meaning
    of this section by reason only
    that he attends at or near or approaches a dwelling-house or place <i>for the purpose only of obtaining or
    communicating information</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge
    (“SCAJ”) that the trial judge erred by restricting the scope of the s. 430(7)
    defence to the communication of information “in order to persuade by rational
    argument.”  Not all communication
    consists of persuasion by rational argument, and it does not follow that just
    because the communication of information for that purpose is protected – see <i>R v. Dooling</i> (1994) 94 C.C.C. (3d) 5245
    (Nfld. S.C.) – communication that is not made to persuade by rational argument
    is not protected.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, however, the SCAJ made two errors that
    require the finding of guilt to be set aside.  First<span class=GramE>,  in</span> holding that the appellant did not attend at or near the complainants’ house only
    for the purpose of communicating information, the SCAJ erroneously conflated an
    act of attendance for the purpose only of communicating information with the
    consequences of that act.  Secondly, the
    SCAJ erred in failing to recognize the ambiguous nature of the phrase “for the
    purpose only of communicating information,” and therefore the need to adopt an
    interpretation that is consistent with the s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> value of freedom of expression.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>“<u>Communicating”
    Information</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I say that the SCAJ erroneously conflated an act of
    attendance for the purpose only of communicating information with the
    consequences of that act, and therefore mistakenly concluded that the
    protection of s. 430(7) was not available to the appellant, for these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as Mr. Greenspon points out, this interpretation
    overlooks the reality that the s. 430(7) defence only comes into play – by
    definition – where it is applied to communication that would otherwise be culpable
    as mischief pursuant to s. 430(1).  Put
    another way, the communication of information will already carry with it the
    wilful intention or purpose to interrupt or interfere with the lawful use or
    enjoyment of property, or recklessness in that regard, before the s. 430(7) <span
class=GramE>defence</span> can even be activated.  To hold that communication with those
    consequences alone cannot trigger the defence because such communication is not
    intended only for the purpose of communicating information (as the SCAJ did),
    or that it does not constitute an attempt to persuade by rational argument (as
    the trial judge did), would be to render the defence ineffective.  That cannot have been Parliament’s intent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the gravamen of the s. 430(7) defence is that
    the accused person’s acts (the “attendance” and its surrounding circumstances) be
    only incidental to the purpose of communicating information.  However, the fact that the <i>consequences</i> of the communication may be
    to persuade others to act in a way that interrupts or interferes with someone
    else’s property is not fatal to the availability of the defence.  All “communication has a purpose or intention
    underlying it.  That is its <i>raison d’être</i>.  By definition, to communicate in this context
    is “to give or pass on [information].”<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  In this regard, I agree generally with the
    following observations of Green J. (as he then was) in <i>Dooling</i>, at paras. 34-35 and 38-39:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I turn now to the applicability of subsection
    430(7) to this case.  It provides that no
    person commits mischief within the meaning of s. 430 by reason only that he or
    she attends at or near a place “for the purpose only of obtaining or
    communicating information”.  Whether this
    is to be interpreted as an exception to the general charging provision or is to
    be regarded as an aid in the interpretation of it, the end result is the same:
    acts which might otherwise be technically regarded as resulting in an
    obstruction, interruption or interference will not be so regarded for the
    purpose of the offence of mischief if the nature of the act is such that it
    amounts to mere presence (“attendance”) at a place and is incidental to a
    purpose of communicating information. … </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the acts of the accused involve more than mere
    attending at or near a place for the purpose of communicating information,
    subsection 430(7) will, of course, not apply.  Thus, if the acts complained of constitute something more than mere
    presence at a place in a manner that is reasonably necessary to communicate
    information or if the communication is in fact a mask or subterfuge for a
    different purpose (and thus the attendance at the place is not necessary to
    accomplish the purpose of the communication) the accused will not be able to
    take advantage of subsection 430(7).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It would be a
    rare case indeed where someone communicates information in the abstract without
    intending to accomplish some other purpose as a result of that communication</i>.
     Unless one is writing in one’s personal
    diary, the expression of information in written form must be designed to
    educate, convince or persuade<i>. </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The fac</i>t
    that the communication of information will likely be for the purpose of
    persuasion oug<span lang=EN-US>ht</span> not to
    take the case out of Subsection <i>430(7) if
    all that is done is the communication of that information</i>.  <i>In my
    view, if the result – indeed, even the intended result – of the communication
    of information is to interfere</i> with an employer’s business in the course of
    a lawful labour dispute <i>the defence of
    Subsection 430(7) remains available</i> provided the only thing done is the
    communication of that information.  <i>The results of the communication are
    irrelevant</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Dooling</i> was a
    picketing case.  Green J. found that,
    although the conduct of the picketers constituted obstruction, interruption and
    interference with respect to the employer’s business – and was, in fact, intended
    to have that very effect and to pressure the employer into a more favourable
    collective agreement – the s. 430(7) defence was nonetheless available to them
    because they were attending at the premises “for the purpose only of …
    communicating information.”  To a similar
    effect is the decision of Rand J. (with which Cartwright J. agreed) in <i>Williams et al v. Aristocratic <span
class=GramE>Restaurants(</span>1974) Limited</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That <i>Dooling</i> and <i>Williams</i> arose in the context of
    labour disputes where the alleged offenders had a statutory and common law
    right to protest and to picket is not a material distinction, in my view.  They simply used that legal-right platform to
    attempt to dissuade third-parties from doing business with their employers, in
    order to pressure and persuade the employer to agree to a contract more in
    their favour.  Here, Mr. Tremblay was
    communicating information for a similar type of reasons.  He did nothing otherwise illegal.  He was not trespassing.  He was not watching and besetting or
    harassing Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry (or, at least was found not guilty in that
    regard).  All he was doing was using his
    own property and his beat-up van to communicate the information he wished to
    communicate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no difference between the labour dispute scenario
    and the case at bar in this respect.  If
    peaceful picketing in order to persuade and pressure an employer to enter into
    a favourable employment contract by interfering with the employer’s business is
    “for the purposes only of … communicating information,” within the meaning of
    s. 430(7), I see no reason why peaceful (albeit unconventional and colourful)
    messaging in order to persuade and pressure a neighbour to settle a lawsuit by
    interfering with their efforts to sell their home is not similarly “for the
    purposes only of … communicating”.  Both
    involve the wilful interruption of or interference with the lawful use or
    enjoyment of property.  Both involve an
    attendance at premises (in this case, the appellant’s own premises) to
    communicate a message. But both – as is the case with nearly all communication
    – also involve an ulterior purpose to the communicative act itself.  In my view, the two situations are
    indistinguishable for these purposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Greenspon submits, the conduct “may be
    unneighbourly, it may be unkind, it may be unwise, and it may not be the sort
    of behaviour most in society would engage in or want others to engage in.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  But is it, and should it be, criminal?  I think not.  In my view, s. 430(7) protects acts done for the purpose of
    communicating information that would otherwise constitute mischief regardless
    of whether the intended results of that communication were to interfere with or
    interrupt the use or enjoyment of another person’s property.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Interpretation

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is consistent with the preservation of the s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> right to freedom of thought
    and expression.  Parliament intended to
    limit significantly the circumstances in which conduct would amount to public
    mischief where the otherwise culpable conduct takes the form of communication
    because communication is an exercise of freedom of expression, an idea that is
    very highly valued in Canadian society.<a

'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  That is the purpose of the s. 430(7) defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ appreciated that there is <span class=GramE>“an
    interplay</span>” between the s. 430(7) defence and the s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> right, i.e. “the preservation of
    a healthy tolerance for freedom of expression.”  He correctly observed that “the purpose of subsection (7) is to clearly
    recognize, protect, and preserve public debate and free speech,” and he gave a non-exhaustive
    series of examples of persons entitled to its protection – pollsters, election
    enumerators, political candidates, sales people, peaceful picketers, solicitors
    of funds, political advocacy groups and the media.  He concluded, however, that in the absence of
    an express <i>Charter </i>challenge – not
    present here – <i>Charter</i> values were of
    little moment in this case because “[they] do not justify rewriting the clear
    language of a statutory provision”: <i>Daley
    v. Economical Mutual Insurance Co. </i>(2005), 206 O.A.C. 33 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, I disagree.  The language of the statutory provision is not
    clear, but there is no need to rewrite it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Charter</i> factors only come into play in the statutory interpretation exercise where there
    is a genuine ambiguity in the language of the statute.  That is, where the language permits of two
    different, but equally plausible, interpretations – each equally consistent
    with the apparent purpose of the statute – the interpretation that accords with <i>Charter</i> principles is to be preferred.  See <i>R
    v. Rodgers</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554 at para. 18; <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at
    para. 62.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, there is a genuine ambiguity in the language of
    s. 430(7) concerning the meaning and scope of the words “communicating
    information,” in my opinion.  It is not
    clear whether the phrase “for the purpose only of … communicating information” means
    for the purpose only of engaging in the act of expression without regard to the
    information conveyed or its underlying purpose, or whether the phrase includes
    communication with the intention of accomplishing some other purpose as a consequence
    of that communication – in this case the wilful intent to interfere with the
    lawful enjoyment by Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry of their property in order to
    persuade them to settle their lawsuit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The latter interpretation is the one that is more
    consistent with the s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> value of freedom of expression, in my view, and should be favoured for that
    reason.  But it is also the one that most
    accords with the language of s. 430(7) of the <i>Criminal </i>Code and with the purpose and object of that provision –
    for the reasons outlined above – and is therefore one that conforms to the
    overarching principle of statutory interpretation, namely, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one
    principle or <span class=GramE>approach,</span> namely, the words of an Act are
    to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense
    harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the
    intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See <i>Sharpe</i>, para 33; <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. <span
class=GramE>21; <i>R. v. McIntosh</i>,
    [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para.</span> 21. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course, the communication must be peaceful and
    non-violent, to be entitled to protection.  And, it must not simply be a mask or subterfuge for conduct that is not
    solely communicative and that has some entirely different purpose.   This
    line will not always be easily drawn and will depend upon the circumstances of
    the case.  The following, however, are some
    examples of conduct held not to be “for purposes only of … communicating
    information.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R v. Tan</i>, 1992
    CanLII 312 (B.C.C.A), the offenders – who were anti-nuclear protesters –
    climbed the anchor chain of a United States aircraft carrier, believing there
    were nuclear warheads aboard and intending to display a radiation symbol
    flag.  Two of them fastened themselves to
    the anchor chain, one with a padlock.  The Court held that the protestors did more than merely attend at the
    site for purposes of communicating information.  Their acts “went beyond trespass” on the US Navy’s property; they
    seriously interfered with “a very crucial part of the moorings of a very large
    vessel.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Conforti</i>,
    [1989] O.J. No. 3151 (Prov. Ct., Crim. Div.), the accused told a court official
    that he had a bomb to blow the place up and showed a device which resemble a bomb
    causing the courthouse to be evacuated.  In <i>R. v. <span class=GramE>Drainville<span style='font-style:normal'> ,</span></span></i> [1991] O.J. No. 340 (Prov. Ct), the accused, an aboriginal protester, blocked a
    private parcel of land that was the subject of a land claim dispute in order to
    protest construction of a road.  He was
    convicted of mischief on the basis that freedom of expression did not include a
    right to use someone else’s private property without permission and did not
    justify forms of expression that were inconsistent with public order.  Without determining whether the same
    rationale would be applied in today’s environment, <i>Drainville</i> provides an example of the kind of conduct that has been
    held to go beyond attendance at a site for the purposes only of communicating
    information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, by contrast to all three examples above, Mr.
    Tremblay’s acts constituted no more than the communication of his message.  They did not constitute trespass or
    harassment.  They did not endanger
    anyone, and they posed no potential risk of damage to the Huppé/Perry property.  The fact that potential purchasers made their
    own decisions, based upon the message, and thereby negatively affected the
    ability of Mr. Huppé and Ms. Perry to sell, does not take Mr. Tremblay’s
    conduct beyond the reach of the s. 430(7) defence, in my view.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal,
