  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dave Palmer died of cardiac arrest secondary to a bowel
    obstruction.  His estate and family
    members allege that the respondent, an emergency room physician, was negligent
    in failing to diagnose a bowel obstruction and in discharging him from the
    hospital the day before he died.  Following an eleven-day jury trial, the jury
    returned a verdict in favour of the respondent finding that there was no
    negligence on his part.  The appellants
    submit that the trial judge erred by failing to provide an adequate jury instruction.  In particular, the appellants argue that the
    trial judge failed to provide the jury with adequate guidance on the critical
    factual issues to be determined.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening of June 26, 2005, Mr. Palmer, attended
    by his sister, was taken by ambulance to the emergency department at
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Mount Sinai
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Hospital.  He was seen by the triage nurse and then the
    emergency room nurse at 12:20 am, June 27, before being assessed by the
    respondent at 2:15 am.  He received IV
    fluids for dehydration and was discharged by the respondent at 5:45 am on June
    27.  In the late evening hours of June
    27, Mr. Palmer complained of shortness of breath and dizziness, began to vomit
    and died of cardiac arrest subsequently determined to be secondary to a bowel
    obstruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some six months earlier, Mr. Palmer had undergone colon
    resection surgery following a diagnosis of stage 2 colon cancer.  He underwent a complete course of chemotherapy
    following surgery and experienced nausea, diarrhoea and fatigue.  He had stopped taking the chemotherapy drugs
    one week prior to his death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The crucial and decisive issue at trial essentially
    involved resolving the contested versions offered by the parties as to Mr.
    Palmer’s condition and symptoms both at the time he was admitted to the
    emergency department and at the time he was discharged.  The appellants relied on the evidence of Mr. Palmer’s
    sister, who was with him at the hospital. The appellants assert that evidence
    showed that the respondent knew or should have known that Mr. Palmer exhibited
    symptoms of a possible bowel obstruction and that the respondent was negligent
    in failing to conduct further investigation.  In particular, the appellants contend that the
    respondent knew or should have known that Mr. Palmer’s clinical picture
    included vomiting and severe abdominal pain of recent onset.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent denied that Mr. Palmer and his sister
    had provided him with the information that would have led to a diagnosis of
    bowel obstruction.  He acknowledged that
    if he had been told what the appellants say he was told, he should have altered
    his differential diagnosis and conducted further investigation as to a possible
    bowel obstruction.  In particular, the
    respondent submits that, despite his own admission to the contrary on
    discovery, in the end there was no evidence of vomiting, a common symptom of
    bowel obstruction.  He testified that he
    attributed Mr. Palmer’s complaints in part to the problems he was having with
    chemotherapy and that he discharged Mr. Palmer because he appeared to be
    improving, his abdominal pain was subsiding and he wanted to go home.  Some entries in the hospital records tend to
    support the appellants’ position while others support that of the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the parties presented conflicting expert evidence
    as to whether the respondent had met the applicable standard of care, at the
    end of the day, the case turned on what the respondent knew or should have known
    about Mr. Palmer’s clinical condition. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellants advanced a number of arguments in
    their factum, during oral submissions the issue arising on this appeal was
    narrowed to whether the trial judge provided the jury with an adequate
    instruction in relation to the legal and, more significantly, the factual
    issues to be resolved.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants served a jury notice and thereby elected
    to have a jury determine any and all contested issues of fact.  Before us, counsel for the respondent frankly
    conceded that this was a case that could have gone either way.  While the appellants assert in their factum
    that the verdict was unreasonable, that submission quite properly was not
    pursued in oral argument as there was evidence which, if accepted by the jury,
    would support the verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground that on each of the crucial factual
    issues, there was some evidence supporting the appellants’ position and that
    there was also some competing evidence supporting that of the respondent.  It is well-established that it is not open to
    an appellate court to retry the case or to substitute its opinion on the facts
    for the findings of the jury.  As our
    role is not to retry the case or to substitute our opinion of the evidence for
    that of the jury, we do not propose to review the evidence in detail.  Our role is limited to the question of whether
    the jury was properly instructed in law and, accordingly, it is upon that
    question that we focus our analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided the jury with what amounted to
    a standard instruction on the law, which included a correct explanation of the
    legal test to be applied in a case of alleged medical malpractice.  The trial judge did not, however, review the
    evidence or identify issues of fact arising from the evidence, except in
    general terms.  The appellants assert
    that the trial judge’s failure to review the evidence amounted to an error of
    law resulting in a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s. 134(6) of
    the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the “Act”), so as
    to require a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge conducted a pre-charge conference with
    counsel to review his draft instructions.  The appellants’ trial counsel indicated that
    both he and counsel for the respondent felt that the jury might need a bit more
    guidance than was set out in the draft charge with respect to the factual
    issues to be determined.  The trial judge
    stated that he had not reviewed the facts because both counsel had done “such a
    marvellous job in going into detail” in their closing addresses to the jury.  He observed, however, that if counsel could
    agree on something he would consider including it.  There the matter rested.  The trial judge instructed the jury in terms
    of the draft charge and no further issue was taken with his treatment of the
    facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, a trial judge should provide the jury with
    an outline of the evidence with a view to assisting it on the factual issues to
    be determined, and nothing in these reasons should be read as being intended to
    discourage that practice or to support some other practice.  That said, we are not persuaded that, in the
    circumstances of this case, the trial judge erred in approaching his
    instructions in the manner that he did or that his failure to review the
    evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have explained, the respondent essentially
    admitted that if he had known what the appellants contended he knew about Mr.
    Palmer’s symptoms and medical condition, he should have taken further steps to
    investigate the possibility of a bowel obstruction. The respondent gave one
    version of the facts and the appellants offered a different version.  At the end of the day, the entire case turned
    on whether the jury accepted what the appellants alleged the respondent knew or
    should have known about Mr. Palmer’s symptoms and condition when he first
    examined him that night in the emergency room, and when he finally discharged
    him early in the morning.  That issue was
    thoroughly canvassed in the evidence and, as the trial judge observed, the
    competing evidence was thoroughly reviewed by counsel in their very effective
    closing addresses.  We are satisfied that
    the trial judge rightly perceived that the crucial factual issues dividing the
    parties and that the jury needed to decide had been clearly identified and
    joined. Simply put, we are satisfied that the jury could have been under no
    misapprehension as to the issues they had to decide or as to the evidence that
    bore upon those questions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We know of no authority laying down the rule that, in a
    civil jury trial, the judge is inevitably required to review the facts.  Nor were we given any authority for the
    proposition that the failure of the trial judge to review the facts necessarily
    requires this court to order a new trial.  Rather, the jurisprudence lends support to the position of the
    respondent that no new trial should be ordered in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We take the functional approach as the applicable analytical
    framework for the assessment of the adequacy of a jury instruction, as set out in
    the following terms by this court in <i>R.
    v. Pomeroy</i> (2008), 91 O.R. (3d) 261, at paras. 116-117: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellate
    courts must adopt a functional approach to reviewing jury charges.  The purpose of such review is to ensure that
    juries are properly -- not perfectly -- instructed. In conducting an appellate
    review, the Supreme Court emphasizes in <i>Daley</i>,
    [[2007] 3 S.C.R. 523] at para. 57:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The
    extent to which the evidence must be reviewed “will depend on each particular
    case. The test is one of fairness.  The
    accused is entitled to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence.  So long as the evidence is put to the jury in
    a manner that will allow it to fully appreciate the issues and the defence
    presented, the charge will be adequate”. [Citations omitted.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The
    functional approach also requires the appellate court not to divorce the jury
    charge from the greater context of the trial. The comments of counsel during
    their addresses, including comments on legal issues should also be considered
    in assessing whether the charge is adequate: see <i>Daley</i>, at para. 58. Here, despite its facial imbalance, the trial judge’s
    charge to the jury, when considered together with the closing addresses of
    counsel, provided the jury with an appreciation of the factual issues to be
    resolved, the evidence relating to the issues, the proper law to be applied and
    the positions of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying that functional approach, when reading this
    record  as a whole, we are satisfied that
    the jury was provided with adequate explanation of the factual issues it was to
    resolve, the evidence that related to those issues, the proper law to be
    applied, and the positions of the parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are directed by s. 134 (6) of the Act not to order a
    new trial unless the error resulted in a “substantial wrong or miscarriage of
    justice”.  In <i>Pereira v. Hamilton Township Farmers’ Mutual Fire Insurance Co.</i>,
    (2006), 209 O.A.C. 127, at para. 75, this court stated that, even where the
    trial judge misdirects the jury, “it will generally not be sufficient for an
    appellant to demonstrate simply that it was open to the jury on the evidence to
    reach a different result.  Something more
    than that is required.”  
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i><span lang=EN-US>Pereira</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> goes on to describe, at paras.
    75-76, what that “something more” might be, laying out three possibilities that
    “[a]n appellant may demonstrate”: 1) “that the case was not fairly put to the
    jury, as, for example, where the charge leaves the jury with a misapprehension
    as to the applicable legal principles”; 2) “that the charge was “materially
    deficient”; or 3) “that the law was not clearly stated on a critical issue”.
    This statement was approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Quan v. Cusson</i>, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712, at
    para. 43.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
    is no suggestion that the trial judge’s charge was unbalanced or unfair, or
    that the evidence was misstated.  The
    trial judge accurately described his approach in the pre-trial conference
    before giving the parties his draft charge: “I take a hands-off position.  I don’t try to put my hands on the scale ...
    [i]t’s their decision and, if I can point them in the general direction then,
    it’s their call”.  Nor is there any
    suggestion that the law was not accurately stated.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue is whether the charge was “materially deficient”.  The cases considering that issue essentially
    adopt the functional approach set out above and have refused to order a new
    trial where the deficiency in the charge is a failure to review the evidence
    without more.  In <i>Brochu v. Pond </i></span>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 722, at para. 68, this
    court <span lang=EN-US>decided that the charge
    was not materially deficient despite the failure to review the testimony and
    evidence relating to the material issues, because the charge “got the job done”
    and did not “give rise to a serious concern as to whether the appellant
    received a fair trial.”  Writing for the
    court, Cronk J.A. noted the following, at paras. 63-64:</span></p>
