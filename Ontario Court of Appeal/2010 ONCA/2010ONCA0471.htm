    April and June 2002, a number of violent robberies of private residences took
    place in the Mississauga area.  The

    addition to various substantive charges, the indictment alleged two counts of
    conspiracy. The first conspiracy count alleged that Thai, Tran and Johnson had,
    during a 15-month period ending in early March 2003, conspired together with
    other named but unindicted co-conspirators including Dang, Rhodes and Dam “to
    commit the indictable offence of armed robbery”.  </span></p>

    indictable offence of robbery by conspiring to plan, prepare and execute a

    evidence at trial demonstrated that a crew had formed for the purpose of
    raiding targeted homes late at night.  Several members of the crew pled guilty – Rhodes to robbery with a
    firearm and conspiracy to commit robbery, Dam to conspiracy to commit robbery
    and Rodney to conspiracy to commit robbery, three counts of disguise with
    intent, two counts of robbery with a firearm, and one count of robbery. </span></p>

    individuals testified at trial.  They
    gave detailed evidence of the appellants’ involvement in the crew.  In general terms, Thai managed the group.  He would call other members about a specifically
    planned robbery and provide them with instructions concerning pick-up.  He would transport them to the targeted
    residence in his van.  The van carried
    disguises, weapons and other items used in the robberies.  Thai would remain in the van while other
    members of the crew invaded the homes.  The crew members shared in the proceeds of the robberies.</span></p>

    answer the charges, he received a severe beating at the hands of two police
    officers resulting in a broken jaw and permanent injury. The police officers
    attempted to cover up their behaviour and, despite these outrages, the Crown
    permitted them remain in court to assist with the prosecution until the trial

    years’ imprisonment (three years, five months and two weeks of imprisonment in
    addition to credit for pre-trial custody and pre-trial bail).  The trial judge refused to stay the
    proceedings against Tran but found that the appropriate remedy was to reduce
    the sentence he would otherwise received by half. After this reduction, Tran
    was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment plus three years’ probation, and Johnson
    was sentenced to an additional twenty-three days of custody after credit for
    pre-trial custody (thirty-five months, seven days).  He received a global sentence of three years
    imprisonment plus three years’ probation.  The parties appeal both their convictions and their sentences.</span></p>

    the reasons that follow, I would dispose of these appeals in the following
    fashion.  In relation to Dang and
    Johnson, I would dismiss the conviction appeals, grant Dang leave to appeal her
    sentence but dismiss her sentence appeals.  In relation to Tran, I would allow the conviction appeal and enter a

    evidence the appellants can point to in support of the multiple conspiracies
    theory arose from the cross-examinations of Rhodes and Dam.  At the highest, their evidence might be taken
    to suggest that during the course of the robberies that they committed, there
    were specific agreements reached about the details of how the robberies would
    be committed, the roles that each participant would play and how the proceeds
    would be divided.  To the extent that
    their evidence discloses specific subsidiary agreements of that nature, it does
    not detract from or alter the essential thrust of their evidence that there

    my view, obvious concerns arise in relation to the admissibility under <i>K.G.B.</i> of facts acknowledged as being
    “substantially correct” on a guilty plea.  The accused person does not make any statement
    but merely acknowledges the truth of those facts through counsel and, as was
    pointed out by defence counsel, even then needs only admit to the truth of the
    facts that constitute the essential elements of the offence.  Where the accused has made a deal with the
    Crown to plead guilty and later to testify against others, there are obvious
    reliability issues surrounding facts acknowledged to be “substantially correct”
    in relation to those other individuals.  Accordingly,
    to admit facts acknowledged to be “substantially correct” on a guilty plea in a

    March 27, 2003, on his counsel’s advice, Tran turned himself in to the Hamilton
    Police.  They determined that this was a

    to Tran, during the drive to Peel, the officers tried to obtain a statement
    from him.  Tran said that Conway told him
    on the drive that he “don’t want to hear me say that I don’t want to make a
    statement, or else it’s going to be the hard way...”  However, Tran had been advised by his lawyer
    not to say anything and the officers’ efforts were unsuccessful.</span></p>

    interview room that was not equipped with a video camera and demanded a
    statement.  Tran continued to invoke his
    right to silence.  Vander Wier punched
    him in the ribs and the jaw.  Tran’s

    placed Tran in front of a video camera and tried (unsuccessfully) to get him to

    extent of Tran’s injuries was not discovered until the next day when he was
    transferred to the Maplehurst Correctional Complex.  Upon arrival, Tran was sent to the hospital
    where it was determined that his jaw was broken.  On April 2, 2003, after Tran’s release on
    bail, he went to another hospital and was attended by an expert in facial
    injuries.  </span></p>

    jaw had been broken in two places. He had a right mandibular fracture and an
    interior fracture running between the central incisors.  The doctor wired Tran’s mouth shut and
    provided follow-up treatment. The permanent consequences of the beating include
    that Tran now bites himself when he eats, has a sore jaw and loose teeth, and
    suffers from migraines.</span></p>

    Conway and Vander Wier described things very differently.  They denied the assault.  They claimed to have left Tran alone in the
    interview room and when they returned, they found him on the floor, still handcuffed,
    with blood coming from his lower lip.  Officer
    Conway testified that it looked like “he had bit his lip”, and that Tran explained
    his presence on the floor by saying “I don’t know, I guess I fell.”  They put him on videotape to tell the truth
    about the source of his injuries.  They
    asked “Have we treated you fairly?”  Tran

    was independent evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> that supported Tran’s version of events.  The most significant evidence was the expert medical evidence that the

    trial judge disbelieved the officers and found the evidence “overwhelming” that
    both officers had assaulted Tran and that specifically Officer Vander Wier had punched
    Tran and broken his jaw.  In his ruling
    at the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i>,
    he said: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I do find based on the evidence, the overwhelming
    evidence that with respect to Mr. Tran, his section 7 and section 12 rights
    were breached.  I do believe his
    evidence, which in my view is corroborated by the evidence of two doctors, both
    Dr. Freidlich and Dr. Allen...[I]t is my finding that the accused’s evidence
    was, in my view, substantiated by the independent evidence of the two doctors
    who testified, one called by the defence and the other by the Crown, in
    addition to the other independent witnesses...and also with respect to all the
    witnesses, in my view, except for the evidence of Officer Vander Wier and
    Officer Conway.  So on the totality of
    the evidence, I do find that there was a breach, which in effect was that Tran
    was assaulted by Officer Vander Wier and Officer Conway while he was in their
    custody.  I also find that one of the
    assaults on Mr. Tran by Officer Vander Wier constituted a punch to his jaw
    which caused his jaw to be broken.  I
    reject the evidence of both Officer Vander Wier and Officer Conway on this
    point, i.e. the cause of the injury to Mr. Tran’s jaw.  </span></p>

    judge’s ruling that Vander Wier had brutally assaulted Tran and violated his <i>Charter</i> rights, Crown counsel invited Officer
    Vander Wier to sit at the counsel table as assisting officer.  Defence counsel moved to have the officer
    precluded from participating in the trial.  Counsel argued that in the light of the fact that Vander Wier had
    violently assaulted Tran, it would be inappropriate for the officer to be
    present in the courtroom and to have contact with witnesses who might feel under

    denied the remedy of a stay on the basis that a stay should only be granted in
    the “clearest of cases” and ruled that as the breach did not affect the
    evidence against Tran, and given the seriousness of the charges, a stay was not
    appropriate.  Instead he ruled that the

    in <i>Regan</i>, a case involving
    prosecutorial abuse, the Supreme Court again considered the approach to cases
    in the residual category. Lebel J., for the majority, said at para. 55:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>As discussed above, most cases of abuse of process will cause prejudice
    by rendering the trial unfair.  Under s.
    7 of the <i>Charter</i>, however, a small
    residual category of abusive action exists which does not affect trial
    fairness, but still undermines the fundamental justice of the system (<i>O’Connor</i>, at para. 73).  Yet even in these cases, the important
    prospective nature of the stay as a remedy must still be satisfied: “[t]he mere
    fact that the state has treated an individual shabbily in the past is not
    enough to warrant a stay of proceedings” (<i>Tobiass</i>,
    at para. 91).  When dealing with an abuse
    which falls into the residual category, generally speaking, a stay of
    proceedings is only appropriate when the abuse is likely to continue or be
    carried forward.  Only in “exceptional”,
    “relatively very rare” cases will the past misconduct be “so egregious that the
    mere fact of going forward in the light of it will be offensive” (<i>Tobiass</i>, at para. 91).</span></p>

    my view, this is one of those “clearest of cases”, were the prosecution should
    be halted.  This case involved horrendous
    police misconduct that breached Tran’s ss. 7 and 12 <i>Charter</i> rights, jeopardized the perception of trial fairness and brought
    the integrity of law enforcement into disrepute.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the trial judge erred when he held that a stay should not be granted because
    the evidence against Tran was not affected and because the charges were
    serious.   The jurisprudence is clear
    that a stay can be granted even where the evidence is not affected and that
    society’s interest in having a trial on the merits is only to be weighed in the
    balance “where uncertainty persists about whether the abuse is sufficient to
    warrant the drastic remedy of a stay:” <i>Regan </i>at para. 57.  Here, there is no uncertainty.  The abuse is serious – more than sufficiently
    serious to warrant a stay.</span></p>

    is essential for the court to distance itself from this kind of state misconduct
    – an unwarranted, grave assault causing bodily harm, delayed medical attention,
    a cover up that included perjury, a prosecutorial response that affected the
    perception of trial fairness and no effective response.  Not to do so would be to leave the impression
    that it tacitly approves of it.  The
    granting of a stay of proceedings affirms the fundamental values of our society
    and ensures that the rights under the <i>Charter</i> are not, in substance, meaningless. </span></p>

    on this analysis, I conclude that the affront to decency and fair play precludes
    any further investigation of the societal interest in the prosecution of the
    case.  In my view, the prosecution must
    therefore be stayed. </span></p>

    her sentence appeal, Dang argued that her sentence was excessive.  Further, she submitted that she should be
    provided with credit for a portion of time spent under house arrest between the

    see no reason to interfere with Dang’s sentence.  First, home invasions involve serious
    criminal conduct that calls for a serious response.  The trial judge’s detailed reasons for sentence

    that pending this appeal, Dang took any steps toward rehabilitation or suffered
    any hardship, let alone the kind of undue hardship that may make a submission
    of this nature relevant to her sentence appeal.</span></p>
