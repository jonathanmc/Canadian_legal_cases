lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The issue in
    this case is whether there is a right of appeal by an elector to the Divisional
    Court under the <i>Municipal Conflict of
    Interest Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.50 (<i>MCIA</i>),
    where the Superior Court declines to make an order under s. 10 finding that a
    member of a municipal council was in a conflict of interest. In my view, the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    correctly held that there is no right of appeal in those circumstances.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2006, the appellants settled a wrongful dismissal
    action with the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Vaughan.
    In 2007 and 2008, Mr. Ruffolo and another elector were involved in proceedings
    to force a compliance audit respecting the respondent’s campaign finances in
    her mayoral campaign. In November 2007, Vaughan City Council voted to commence
    litigation against the appellants for breach of the settlement agreement. The
    respondent’s involvement in that decision consisted of the following: The
    respondent received an agenda for a meeting of a closed session of the
    Committee of the Whole including consideration of the proposed lawsuit. The
    respondent sought legal advice regarding any potential conflict. The respondent
    attended the Committee of the Whole where the issue was discussed. She also
    attended the subsequent Council meeting where the vote was taken, but she did
    not participate in the vote.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on these actions, the appellants brought an
    application under s. 9 of the <i>MCIA</i> for <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 10 order removing the respondent from the
    office of Mayor of Vaughan for alleged violations of ss. 5(1) and (2) of the
    Act. Kelly J. dismissed the application, finding that the respondent had no
    personal pecuniary interest in the City’s action against the appellants and no
    other conflict of interest. In any event, the respondent sought legal advice
    and did not participate in the vote; any possible conflict in her actions would
    have been saved by the s. 10(2) defence of inadvertence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought to appeal to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.
    On a motion to quash the appeal, Jennings J. held that the only appeal provided
    in the Act is by a member where a conflict of interest is found. There is no
    right of appeal by an elector from a decision that the member was not in a
    conflict of interest.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is there a right of appeal by an elector from a finding
    that a member did not breach ss. 5(1), (2) or (3) of the <i>MCIA</i>, either under s. 11 of that Act or under s. 6(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>?</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of the Divisional Court’s jurisdiction to
    hear an appeal by an elector from a refusal to make an order under s. 10 was
    determined by that court in 1991 in <i>Van
    Schyndel v. Harrell</i> (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 335 (leave to appeal to the C.A.
    refused January&nbsp;20, 1992). In that case, the majority held that the <i>MCIA</i> is intended to be a complete code
    dealing with municipal conflicts of interest and that the procedures, including
    any appeal rights, are to be found in its provisions. Section 11 of the Act
    only allows an appeal from an order made under s. 10. Section 10 gives the
    court the power to impose certain penalties where it finds that a member or
    former member has acted in a conflict of interest. Where the court finds no
    conflict of interest under s. 5, no order is made under s.&nbsp;10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority explained that this result reflects the
    intent of the legislature to provide a procedure to deal with allegations of
    conflict of interest for elected municipal representatives, but not to allow
    such allegations to be prolonged by appeal through the three-year term of a
    member where the court finds no conflict of interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of its analysis, the majority referred to the
    fact that the statute is awkwardly worded and in that context, because it is
    penal in nature, it should be narrowly interpreted in favour of the member in
    case of ambiguity. This aspect of the reasoning, however, was superseded a
    couple of years later by a new approach adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v. Hasselwander</i>, [1993] 2
    S.C.R. 398, where Cory J. stated, at p. 413 (para. 30):  “even with penal statutes, the real intention
    of the legislature must be sought, and the meaning compatible with its goals
    applied.” The balance of the analysis of the majority that I have described
    does address the intention of the legislature in the context of the words used
    in the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dissenting judge equated the appeal found in s. 11
    of <i>MCIA</i> with appeal provisions in
    other acts such as the <i>Business
    Corporations Act</i>, 1982, S.O. 1982 c. 4, as amended, s. 254, and the <i>Landlord and Tenant Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c.
    232, as amended, s.&nbsp;116(1), where the wording of the appeal provisions
    read: “an appeal lies from any order made under this Act”.  He concluded that if the majority decision
    was correct, then no appeal would lie from the refusal to make an order under
    those acts. However, the difference in the wording of the appeal provisions
    explains the difference in the scope of appeal rights. In s. 11 of the <i>MCIA,</i> the only appeal is from an order
    made under s. 10, which is an order for a penalty following a finding of
    conflict of interest. Under the appeal provisions of the other acts referred
    to, the appeal is from any order made under the Act. That would include an
    order not to grant the relief requested, because the request is made “under the
    Act”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dissenting judge also raised a further concern with
    the majority interpretation—that there could be a finding of a conflict of
    interest under s. 8 of the Act, but no appeal from such a finding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the Act does not operate in that way.
    Although s. 8 grants the court the jurisdiction to both try and determine the “question
    of whether or not a member has contravened ss. 5(1), (2), or (3)”, it is under s.
    10 that the court makes the positive determination of a contravention, then applies
    the defence of inadvertence if applicable, and where the defence does not
    apply, imposes the penalty. The appeal then lies under s.&nbsp;11 from the order
    made under s. 10, determining a contravention and imposing the penalty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the majority’s interpretation of the
    appeal provision. The fact that there is no appeal granted to an elector where
    the member is found not to be in conflict makes sense in the context of the
    purpose of this Act. An elector is entitled to have a hearing of his or her
    allegation, but if it is found to be without merit, then that finding is final
    and the member may continue to represent his or her constituents for the
    balance of the term. There is no right to an appeal in law; an appeal is
    granted by statute, and if not granted, does not exist as an inherent right<i>: R. v. H. (E.) </i> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 202 at p. 208 (C.A.); <span
class=SpellE><i>Kourtessis</i></span><i> v. M.N.R.</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53 at pp.
    69-70. On the other hand, where a member is found to be in conflict of
    interest, a very serious matter, a right to appeal is granted. Nor does s. 15
    of the <i>Charter</i> apply to require
    equality of appeal rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also reject the alternative submission of the
    appellants that where there is no appeal to the Divisional Court, an appeal
    lies to the Court of Appeal under s. 6(1)(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. The <i>MCIA </i>provides a complete code for
    dealing with the possibility of conflict of interest by municipal politicians,
    including providing full procedural rights. Section 13 of the Act prohibits any
    disqualification proceedings other than under the Act, and s. 15 makes the Act
    prevail in the case of conflict with any other act. The appeal provided by s.
    11 is the only appeal right under the Act.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I agree with Jennings J. in the
    <st1:Street

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    that that court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the elector from the

    would dismiss the appeal from the order quashing the appellants’ appeal to the
