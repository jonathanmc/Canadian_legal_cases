    appeal arose from a 14-year business relationship between two friends, the
    respondent, Joseph Fedel (“Fedel”), and one of the appellants, Kenneth Tan
    (“Tan”).  The primary issue is whether
    Fedel had a sufficient interest in one of the companies that carried on the
    business – the appellant, Gum Products International Inc. (“GPI”) – so as to
    entitle him to a remedy under s. 248 of the Ontario <i>Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (“<i>OBCA</i>”).  The application judge found that he did.  I agree.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts  </span></h4>

    and Tan differed in several important respects.  The application judge recognized that findings of credibility were
    critical.  He found that both were
    prepared to mislead in order to advance their own interests.  However, on the essential issues, in
    particular with respect to Fedel’s claimed ownership interest in GPI, the application
    judge found Fedel to be credible.  He did
    not accept Tan’s evidence.  Where the
    evidence of the two conflicted, he preferred the evidence of Fedel.  The application judge set out his reasons for
    his credibility findings with care.  He
    then went on to make findings of fact based on those findings of credibility.</span></p>

    not challenge the application judge’s findings of credibility, <span
class=GramE>nor</span> his findings of fact.  Rather, his arguments are directed at the conclusions that the
    application judge drew based on his factual findings.  That being the case, my summary of the facts
    is based almost entirely on the findings made by the application judge.  In addition, I have limited my summary of the
    facts to only those matters necessary to address the issues raised on appeal.</span></p>

    commissioned salesman for Shemberg Marketing Corporation (“Shemberg
    Philippines”), a Philippines company owned by Tan’s brother-in-law.  Shemberg Philippines was in the business of
    exporting processed and semi-processed carrageenan, a seaweed derivative used
    as a thickening, stabilizing or emulsifying agent in many processed food
    products, particularly in the meat industry.  Shemberg Philippines paid Tan a 5 per cent commission on sales he
    made.  </span></p>

    invited Fedel to join him in the sale of carrageenan for Shemberg
    Philippines.  Tan and Fedel agreed that
    they would pool their sales together and split the five per cent commission on
    a 55 per cent to Tan, 45 per cent to Fedel basis.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    hold Fedel’s share of commissions in an offshore account and would pay Fedel on
    request.  Fedel admitted that he did not declare
    the amounts paid to him for income tax purposes.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    company called Shemberg Marketing Canada (“Shemberg Canada”).  Tan was the sole shareholder.  He incorporated Shemberg Canada because some
    customers of Shemberg Philippines preferred dealing with an Ontario company and
    because the new company would enable Tan and Fedel to provide customers with
    smaller quantities of carrageenan than Shemberg Philippines was able or willing
    to deliver.  Fedel became a director of
    Shemberg Canada.  Tan and Fedel continued
    to split profits as before.  </span></p>

    with Tan would rise and fall as Fedel requested withdrawals.  Tan used the monies owing as he wished,
    including for the capitalization of Shemberg Canada.  In February 1996, Tan held more than $196,000
    for Fedel, which he paid out when Fedel requested.  </span></p>

    Tan and Fedel’s business relationship during this period as an “unincorporated
    partnership, carrying on a business in common”.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In May 1995, Tan and Fedel were
    at a conference in Germany.  They entered
    into an oral agreement that they would continue to carry on the carrageenan
    business together through a new company in which Tan would be a 60 per cent
    owner and Fedel a 40 per cent owner (the “oral agreement”).  In exchange for his 40 per cent interest,
    Fedel agreed to contribute to the company financially and by providing
    services.  They agreed that Tan would
    have the larger percentage because he would be responsible for looking after
    the organization and administration of the business as well as continuing to be
    involved in carrageenan sales.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In September 1996, Tan
    instructed his solicitor to incorporate GPI to carry on the carrageenan
    business in Canada.  It was intended that
    GPI would import processed and semi-processed carrageenan, have it ground and
    blended into different products, and then sold and distributed to customers
    around the world.  GPI commenced
    operations in the spring of 1997.</span></p>

    Tan and Fedel were appointed directors.  Tan was issued 100 per cent of the shares.  No shares of GPI were ever issued or
    transferred to Fedel.  Tan told Fedel
    that it would be best that no shares be issued to him but assured Fedel that he
    had a 40 per cent ownership interest.  Fedel trusted Tan and relied on his assurance.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>GPI was capitalized by the
    transfer of inventory from Shemberg Canada valued at $770,258.78.  This inventory had been delivered to Shemberg
    Canada by Shemberg Philippines in 1995 and 1996.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 1995 and 1996, disputes
    arose between Shemberg Canada and Shemberg Philippines.  On Tan’s instructions, Shemberg Canada began
    withholding payments for shipments of carrageenan received from Shemberg
    Philippines.  In response, Shemberg
    Philippines withheld the payment of commissions to Shemberg Canada.  As a result, the amount owing for the
    inventory that Shemberg Canada transferred to GPI was reduced by at least
    $200,000.  Pursuant to his agreement with
    Tan, Fedel was entitled to some of the commissions that Shemberg Philippines
    withheld.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly after GPI was
    incorporated, Tan arranged to have another company incorporated in the Cayman
    Islands.  This company, Gum Products
    International (BVI) Inc. (“BVI”), was incorporated to receive commissions
    earned from the sale of carrageenan in certain countries.  The appellant, Gum Products International
    Worldwide Inc. (“WW”), is a successor corporation to BVI.  It was incorporated in the British Virgin
    Islands in June 1998.  Nothing turns on
    the fact that WW is a successor corporation.  For clarity, I will refer to the two corporations simply as WW.  Although no shares of WW were ever issued or
    transferred to Fedel, Tan acknowledged in this litigation that Fedel was to
    have a 40 per cent equity interest in WW through a trust.  </span></p>

    to work for GPI in the sale of carrageenan for 26 months.  Paying for the product at the inflated price
    was financially burdensome to GPI and to Fedel, who took a reduction in income
    from GPI during this period.</span></p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    of appeal, it is important to make clear the basis on which Fedel brought his
    application (other than the claim for wrongful dismissal), as well as the basis
    on which the application judge found liability and ordered remedies.  Fedel brought the application pursuant to s.
    248 of the <i>OBCA</i>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    liability and ordered remedies solely under that section.  He found that Tan had carried on the affairs
    of GPI, WW and the other appellant corporations in a manner that was
    oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to and that unfairly disregarded Fedel’s
    interests as a security holder of GPI and WW.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As part of the analysis that
    led him to conclude that Fedel was entitled to a remedy under s. 248, the application
    judge found that Fedel had a contractual right to become a 40 per cent
    shareholder of GPI.  However, he did not
    base his finding of liability on a breach of contract, nor did he purport to
    award a remedy for breach of contract.  Rather, the application judge considered Fedel’s contractual right as
    one factor in determining that Fedel was a proper complainant to bring an
    application under s. 248 and that he had an interest as a “security holder”
    that was protected by the section.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b) The Agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Tan argues that the application
    judge erred in finding that he and Fedel entered into the oral agreement in
    1995, pursuant to which Tan agreed that Fedel would own 40 per cent of the
    carrageenan business.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge accepted
    Fedel’s evidence that Tan promised him a 40 per cent ownership interest in a
    new company that would carry on the carrageenan business.  In exchange, Fedel promised to contribute to
    the business, both financially and by continuing to work for the company in
    order to help it grow and prosper.  The application
    judge rejected Tan’s evidence that there was no such agreement.  He found that Tan and Fedel had exchanged
    promises and that those promises related to the business that was carried on by
    GPI and WW after they were incorporated.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue whether Tan and Fedel
    exchanged the promises that constitute the oral agreement was a straight
    credibility contest between the two.  The
    application judge accepted Fedel’s evidence.  He was entitled to do so.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Tan goes on to argue that even
    if Tan and Fedel entered into the oral agreement, the application judge erred
    in concluding that Fedel had a contractual right to a 40 per cent ownership
    interest in GPI.  Tan argues that due to
    a lack of certainty as to the agreement’s terms, it was unenforceable. Tan says
    the agreement was not clear as to which business it applied, how that business
    was to be continued, where it was to operate, where it would obtain product,
    who it would employ, what it would be named and how the two principals would
    provide capital in order to finance it.  Tan further argues that it was also not clear at what point Fedel would
    become a shareholder and at what point the agreement was breached.  Moreover, as time passed, there was
    uncertainty as to the percentage of shares to which Fedel was entitled.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept these arguments.  While some of the details that Tan says were
    missing in the oral agreement may not have been discussed at the time the oral
    agreement was formed, any such failure did not hinder the two from carrying on
    the carrageenan business in the following 10 years pursuant to the oral
    agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 1996, Tan caused GPI and WW
    to be incorporated.  After incorporation,
    the companies continued and developed the carrageenan business in which Tan and
    Fedel had previously been involved.  Tan
    held all the shares of both companies either directly or through a trust.  On many occasions, Tan assured Fedel that he
    was an owner of GPI and WW.  While sometimes
    Tan suggested that the ownership interest was less than 40 per cent, the
    important point for the present discussion is that Tan recognized throughout
    that Fedel had an ownership interest. Indeed, in this litigation, he accepts
    that Fedel owned 40 per cent of WW.  His
    dispute is solely with Fedel’s claim to an ownership interest in GPI.  I will come back to the amount of Fedel’s
    ownership interest below.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found
    that Fedel relied upon Tan’s promises that he had an ownership interest in both
    companies.  Fedel trusted Tan and made
    significant contributions to the businesses as part of his bargain with Tan.  He contributed financially by leaving earned
    commissions in GPI.  He helped with the
    initial capitalization of the company.  He loaned GPI $50,000 in 2003.  Fedel continued working for GPI at a reduced income during the period
    that the Shemberg litigation settlement was being implemented.  Fedel also contributed to the business with
    his “extensive and successful work as the prime salesperson for GPI.”</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly before Fedel commenced this
    litigation in 2006, Tan recognized Fedel’s interest in GPI.  Fedel wrote Tan stating, “[y]ou and I started
    this company [GPI] 60/40 – lately, <span class=GramE>it</span> seems every time
    I exhale you are telling me that I own less of it”.  Tan responded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Anyway,
    yes we both started the company but I started it first, yes?  Thus, I always had the higher percentage
    since Day 1 to reflect this fact.  Anyway, I’ve immensely enjoyed our partnership over the years ….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Your
    comment on the 60/40 split is accurate.  We agreed that when we have a profit sharing, whatever is left after we
    give everyone else their cut, the remainder is split 60/40 between me and you,
    respectively.  That has not changed and
    that is still true today.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Tan argues that over time the
    60-40 division of ownership in GPI changed, or at least that there was a lack
    of clarity as to what ownership interest Fedel was entitled to.  The application judge rejected this
    argument.  While there are references in
    some documents prepared by or on behalf of Tan that say Fedel owned less than
    40 per cent of GPI, the application judge found that Fedel never agreed to
    anything other than the 60-40 split referred to in the oral agreement.  Indeed, Tan’s 2006 e-mail referred to in the
    preceding paragraph supports this conclusion.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge’s
    conclusion as to a 60-40 split is also supported by the fact that in this
    litigation Tan accepts that Fedel has a 40 per cent ownership interest in
    WW.  Given the nature of the businesses
    carried on by GPI and WW and the relationship of the two companies, it seems
    illogical that Tan would agree that Fedel is entitled to a 40 per cent interest
    in one and not in the other.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it was clearly open
    to the application judge to find, on the basis of the oral agreement and the
    actions of the two parties in implementing that agreement, that Fedel had a
    contractual right to 40 per cent ownership in the shares of GPI.  Any lack of clarity about the terms at the
    time of the formation of the oral agreement did not interfere with the way the
    parties were able to perform under the agreement over a lengthy period of
    time.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, I do not accept that
    the application judge erred in not determining at what point in time Tan
    breached his agreement with Fedel.  Nor
    do I accept that the application judge erred in not considering what remedies
    were available to Fedel based on a breach of contract.  As I said above, Fedel’s application was not
    founded on an alleged breach of contract.  His claims of wrongful conduct against Tan, GPI and the other
    respondents extended beyond an allegation of breach of contract.  The success or failure of Fedel’s application
    turned on whether he was entitled to a remedy under s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i>.  </span></p>

    judge was correct in finding that Fedel had a contractual right to a 40 per
    cent ownership interest in GPI, Fedel was limited to suing Tan for breach of
    contract.  He argues that the application
    judge, in effect, impermissibly granted Fedel equitable relief under s. 248 on
    the basis of a finding of a breach of contract.  He submits that a court must give full effect to a contract without
    recourse to s. 248 when there is an unambiguous contract on which a party can

    O.A.C. 59, which held that an oppression remedy was not intended to be a

    argument is that Fedel’s complaints against Tan and the corporate respondents exceeded
    a simple breach of contract claim.  The application
    judge found that Tan and Fedel’s businesses were essentially “incorporated
    partnerships”.  Fedel had a reasonable
    expectation that Tan was operating the businesses of GPI and WW in a proper
    manner and that he was protecting Fedel’s 40 per cent ownership interest in
    those companies.  The remedies that Fedel
    sought under s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i> went
    well beyond remedies that were available to him for Tan’s breach of his
    agreement to deliver 40 per cent of the shares to him.  To succeed, however, Fedel needed to
    establish that he had a sufficient interest in GPI to entitle him to remedies
    under s. 248.</span></p>

    contractual remedy should be sought where the sole complaint is that of a
    breach of contract.  It does not,
    however, suggest that the mere fact that a claim could be brought for breach of
    contract precludes the application of the oppression remedy where its
    application is otherwise appropriate.  <i> </i>In <i>J.S.M.</i>, at para. 66, the court
    reasoned that the oppression remedy is not intended to give a creditor
    after-the-fact protection against the risks assumed when entering into an
    agreement with a corporation, but is an appropriate remedy in situations where
    a creditor finds its “interest as a creditor compromised by unlawful and
    internal corporate manoeuvres against which the creditor cannot effectively
    protect itself”.   In my view, that
    reasoning applies equally to a case such as the present where the interest
    asserted by the applicant is an ownership interest rather than that of a
    creditor and where the applicant establishes that its interest has been harmed
    by conduct that is protected by s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i>.  </span></p>

    in preparing Tab 12 was to show Fedel how much money GPI owed him.  The application judge quite properly attached
    substantial weight to Tab 12.  Although
    Tan attempted at trial to resile from some of the numbers in Tab 12, including
    the Gumindo commissions, he failed to produce any backup documentation to
    support his positions.  Fedel testified
    that he did not know whether the Gumindo commissions had been received or
    not.  Fedel did not have access to GPI’s
    accounting records.  As pointed out
    above, the application judge found Tan to be an incredible witness in many
    respects.  With regard to the Gumindo
    commissions, the application judge chose to rely on Tab <span class=GramE>12,</span> a document prepared by Tan before Fedel commenced this litigation, rather than
    on Tan’s unsupported testimony at trial.  In my view, it was open to the application judge to do so.  I would not give effect to this

    for management fees and renovation charges improperly charged to GPI by Sunginvest.
    The challenge here is only to the inclusion of Sunginvest as a party liable to

    argues that the claim is derivative in nature and as such offends the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> (1843), 2 Hare 461, 67
    E.R. 189.</span></p>

    judge awarded Fedel $26,484 (40 per cent of $66,210), which was the value of a
    corporate opportunity improperly appropriated from GPI.  QPL was involved in the transactions that
    resulted in that appropriation.  The application
    judge found Tan, GPI and QPL jointly and severally liable to pay this
    amount.  As with the Sunginvest issue,
    the only issue here is whether the application judge erred in holding QPL
    liable.  </span></p>

    one body corporate is affiliated with another when they are both controlled by
    the same person.  The application judge
    found that Tan is the <i>de facto</i> controlling mind and shareholder of all the appellant corporations.  Sections 248(2) and 248(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>j)
    permit a court to “make an order to rectify the matters complained of”,
    including an order compensating an aggrieved person, where it is satisfied that
    there is an act of oppression “in respect of a corporation or any of its
    affiliates” by a corporation or any of its affiliates.  That being the case, the application judge
    was entitled to find as he did that Sunginvest and QPL were liable to Fedel

    nature and must fail because they offend the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i>.  Fedel did
    not seek a return to GPI of 100 per cent of the amounts in issue.  Rather, he sought only the return of the
    diminution of his interest in GPI based on his 40 per cent equity
    position.  </span></p>

    implicitly found that Fedel was a beneficial owner of 40 per cent of GPI and
    WW.  He fashioned a remedy that was
    intended to compensate Fedel for monies GPI owed to him, for 40 per cent of the
    profits of WW and for 40 per cent of the money or value of opportunities that
    Tan caused GPI to improperly transfer to his personal benefit.</span></p>

    asked for an order that Tan or GPI deliver to him a share certificate for 40
    per cent of GPI.  In addition, he sought
    a valuation of his interest in the profits of GPI and an order that Tan or GPI
    acquire his interest in those profits. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons, the application
    judge indicated that there should be a complete severance of the interests of
    Fedel and the respondents to the application.  He then fashioned his compensation award.  The award was substantial.  Including the severance pay, it amounted to more
    than $1.7 million.  However, the application
    judge did not direct that Tan or GPI deliver a share certificate for 40 per
    cent of GPI.  Nor did he direct a
    valuation of the profits of GPI.  Implicitly, the application judge considered that the compensation award
    was sufficient to address all Fedel’s interests.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fedel, in his cross-appeal,
    argues that the application judge’s compensation order leaves Tan with a 100
    per cent ownership of GPI, which would include the value of any goodwill and
    assets after deducting liabilities, including the application judge’s
    compensation awards.  In fashioning a
    remedy, Fedel argues that the application judge failed to account for his
    reasonable expectation that he owned 40 per cent of the companies.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not allow the
    cross-appeal.  Section 248 is remedial
    legislation that provides a court with considerable latitude in deciding on a
    fair and just remedy in the circumstances of a particular case.  A trial judge’s decision with respect to an
    appropriate award of compensation under s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i> is entitled to considerable deference in this court.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In fashioning a remedy based on
    the relief sought in Fedel’s application, the application judge was required to
    decide first whether or not he would order Tan and GPI, or both, to deliver to
    Fedel 40 per cent of the issued shares of GPI.  Had he done so, Fedel would have continued as a shareholder.  The application judge decided against this
    approach.  In my view, his decision was
    sensible.  It was clear that the
    relationship between the parties in this small, closely held company was beyond
    repair.  Having reached that conclusion,
    the application judge was then left with the question of what he should order
    by way of compensation to Fedel for his interest in GPI.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In making the compensation
    order, the application judge recognized that he was not compensating Fedel for
    the full value of his interest.  He said,
    “<span class=GramE>the</span> compensation awarded probably understates Fedel’s
    actual losses” (para. 226).  The
    application judge was not satisfied that there was a sufficient evidential
    basis to support a greater or differently premised award in favour of
    Fedel.  The application judge’s
    appreciation of the whole of the evidence in this regard is subject to
    considerable appellate deference.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge also had <span
class=GramE>a discretion</span> with respect to the amount of compensation to
    be ordered.  The application judge heard
    the evidence, particularly of the two protagonists, and was fully aware of the
    circumstances that gave rise to their relationship and to their falling out.  Clearly, the application judge was critical
    of Tan, but he also found that Fedel was not an entirely reliable witness and
    that his conduct of his personal affairs was not always beyond reproach.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition, the application
    judge found that Fedel’s interest in GPI arose in part from the fact that from
    time to time GPI was able to use money that was owed to Fedel for operating
    purposes.  Making money available to GPI
    in this manner was part of Fedel’s contribution to the capital of the company
    and was a factor that led the application judge to conclude that Fedel had an
    ownership interest in GPI.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In para. 221(1) of his reasons,
    the application judge directed Tan and GPI to fully reimburse Fedel for all
    monies that GPI owed him for his financial contributions.  Although the application judge did not frame
    this award as a return of capital, in the context of the relationship as it had
    developed, this part of the compensation award could be seen at least in part
    in this fashion.  That being the case,
    the application judge’s compensation order addressed, in some measure,
    compensation for Fedel’s ownership interest.  In addition, the application judge’s compensation order included a
    requirement that GPI and Tan compensate Fedel for all monies improperly removed
    from the company.  Again, this part of
    the compensation award addressed, to some extent, Fedel’s ownership interest.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the end, I am not persuaded

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, as to the second

  <h3>Disposition</h3>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would allow the appeal in
