style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1995, the appellant was convicted of sexual
    assault based on an allegation that he assaulted a resident at the Huronia
    Regional Centre.  Since his conviction
    the appellant has pursued various avenues in an attempt to overturn the finding
    of guilt.  Those attempts have included
    an unsuccessful appeal to this court in 1996, a successful result at an
    arbitration hearing that was later quashed by the courts, an application for
    ministerial review and finally an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  On December 3, 2009, the Supreme Court of
    Canada allowed the appeal and remanded the case to this court.  The issues before us are the admissibility of
    fresh evidence and whether that evidence, if admitted, establishes that there
    was a miscarriage of justice at the original trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We agree with Crown counsel that the test for fresh evidence
    has been met and that the appeal must be allowed.  The Crown’s case in 1995 depended upon the
    evidence of Daniel Wither, another employee at the Centre.  Four years after the alleged assault, he
    claimed that he saw the appellant sexually assault a severely
    developmentally-delayed resident.  The
    alleged assault and accompanying lewd remarks were completely out of character
    for the appellant, who was described at sentencing as a caring and dedicated
    employee.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant’s 1995 trial was a brief one.  Defence counsel did not call the appellant
    nor adduce any defence evidence.  Substantial material that could have undermined the credibility of Mr.
    Wither was available to the defence, and actually in counsel’s file, but was not
    used by the appellant’s trial counsel.  We note in particular that there was substantial evidence available to
    the defence showing that Mr. Wither had a motive to falsely implicate the appellant
    and that Mr. Wither was in breach of a <span class=GramE>directive, that</span> he would have known about, to immediately report incidents of sexual abuse.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We agree with Crown counsel that while not all of the proposed
    evidence meets the test for fresh evidence, there is a substantial body of
    admissible fresh evidence showing that the appellant did not receive effective
    assistance of counsel.  We refer in
    particular to the material concerning the so-called Herring Report that could have
    demonstrated Wither’s motive to lie and the material that could have undermined
    Wither’s explanation for his failure to report the alleged assault at the
    time.  These materials were either actually
    available to trial counsel or could easily have been obtained.  The failure to use the materials in
    cross-examination of Wither and as part of a defence case demonstrates
    ineffective assistance of counsel, even granting the strong presumption that
    counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable and professional
    assistance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We are also satisfied that failing to use the evidence
    resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  The appellant has demonstrated that the verdict is unreliable since if
    counsel had performed in a competent fashion, there is a reasonable possibility
    that the verdict could have been different.  The Crown’s case depended upon Mr. Wither’s testimony.  The fresh evidence, used effectively, could
    have so undermined his credibility as to leave the jury with a reasonable doubt
    that the alleged assault ever occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, the fresh evidence is admitted, the appeal is
    allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We wish to thank Ms. Woolcombe for the Crown/respondent and
