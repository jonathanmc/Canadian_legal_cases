  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1] This
    is an appeal from the order of Cullity J. wherein he ordered and declared that
    any provision contained in the Midas Franchise and Trademark Agreement (the
    “Agreement”) requiring franchisees to release the appellant, Midas Canada Inc.
    (“Midas”), from liability as a condition for the renewal or transfer of their
    rights under the Agreement was unenforceable and void for the purposes of this
    class proceeding.  The motion judge
    further ordered that the appellant was prevented from requiring the respondent,
    405341 Ontario Limited (“405”), to release the appellant from the claims
    certified in this class proceeding as a condition of renewal or transfer of its
  rights under its Agreement.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]</span><span
lang=EN-US> The
    within class proceeding was certified by order dated March 26, 2009. The
    proceeding involves a dispute between the appellant and a national class of
    franchisees over whether the appellant breached its statutory or common law
    duties when it outsourced product supply to a third-party supplier.  The respondent, 405, was appointed as the representative
  plaintiff.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]</span><span
lang=EN-US> The
  following common issues have been certified for the purpose of the class proceeding:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>A. Did Midas Canada Inc. (“Midas”) breach
    its obligations to the class members by reason of a common law duty to exercise
    its rights under the Franchise Agreement honestly, fairly and in good faith, or
    its statutory duties of fair dealing, by terminating the Midas product supply
    system and substituting and implementing the Uni-Select agreement, including,
    without limitation, by:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US><span
class=GramE>a</span>.  retaining
    the full 10 per cent royalty after it ceased to sell automotive products and accessories (“Products”)
  to class  members;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>b.  negotiating
    and receiving rebates, allowances or other consideration
    from third-party suppliers of products on  account of
  the class members’ purchases of Products; or</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US><span
class=GramE>c</span>.  funding its
    warranty obligations, in whole or in part, through rebates provided by third-party
  suppliers of Products?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>B. If a breach of the duty of good faith is
    proved, then has Midas been unjustly enriched at the class members’ expense by
    retaining the full 10 per cent royalty after it ceased to sell Products to
  class members?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>C. In the event that Midas breached any of
    its contractual or statutory duties referred to in A., what is the appropriate
  measure of the damages, if any, to which members of the class are entitled?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>D. Are the class members entitled to either
  or each <span class=GramE>of:</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US><span class=GramE>a</span>.  a rebate of part of the royalties paid
    by them after Midas ceased to sell Products to class members, and, if so, in
    what  amount;
  and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US><span
class=GramE>b</span>.  an abatement
  of royalties to be paid by them in the future and, if so, in what amount?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>E.  Are the class members entitled to
    declaratory or injunctive relief in respect of all, or any, of the breaches
    referred to in A, that are found to have occurred, including an order for an
    accounting or audit of rebates and allowances received by Midas from third
    party suppliers of Products and amounts expended by Midas in discharging its
  warranty obligations?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>F.  Should Midas <span class=GramE>be</span> required to pay punitive, exemplary or aggravated damages to
  the class members? If so, what is the amount of such damages?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]</span><span
lang=EN-US> The
    causes of action on which the class members rely include breaches of the Agreement
    and of the duty of fair dealing set out in s. 3 of the <i>Arthur Wishart Act </i></span><i>(Franchise
  Disclosure), 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 3 (the “Act”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]</span><span
lang=EN-US> The
    issues raised on this appeal arose as a result of the expiry of the respondent
    representative plaintiff’s Agreement on July 29, 2009, during the pendency of
  this class proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]</span><span
lang=EN-US> While
    the Agreement permits the respondent to extend its franchise relationship for
  an additional 20-year term, s. 9.3 of the Agreement provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span
lang=EN-US>Terms of Franchise during Extension
    Period:</span></b><span lang=EN-US>  The term of the extension of the franchise
    relationship shall be twenty (20) years, and the franchise fee for such
    extension shall be one-half of the franchise fee charged new franchisees by
    Midas at the time of the extension.  In
    all other respects, the form of the agreement governing the extension of the
    franchise relationship shall be the same as that granted to new franchisees at
    the time of such extension, except for special conditions, if any, which are
    imposed in connection with the extension.  <i>Franchisee
    and each of its shareholders, directors, and officers shall, as a condition for
    the extension of the franchise relationship, execute and deliver to Midas a
    general release of any and all claims and causes of action against Midas, its
    affiliated corporations, and their respective officers, agents, and employees</i>.
  [Emphasis Added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]</span><span
lang=EN-US> Following
    certification, questions arose as to the obligation of the respondent to
    execute a release as a condition of renewing its Agreement when it expired on
    July 29, 2009.  The release in the
  proposed renewal agreement provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>GENERAL RELEASE.</span></span><span lang=EN-US>  Franchisee and its owners, officers and directors (“Releasers”),
    individually, hereby release, remise and forever discharge Midas and its parent
    corporation, subsidiary entities and affiliated entities, and its/their
    respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, servants and
    employees, from all claims, demands, covenants, judgments, agreements,
    promises, damages, debts, accounts, suits and causes of action of any nature
    whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, which Franchisee and/or Releasers or
    any of its/their respective successors, assigns, parent, affiliates,
    subsidiaries, executors, administrators, legatees and heirs have, or may have,
    including, but not limited to, matters in any way relating to the Midas Shop,
    the Franchise Agreement or the franchisor – franchisee relationship. Franchisee
    and Releasers each state that it has read the foregoing and understands that it
  is a general release and that it intends to be legally bound thereby.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]</span><span
lang=EN-US>There was also an issue raised in respect
    of another franchisee and class member, 1078460 Ontario Inc. (“107”), who had under
    protest provided a release at the time of an assignment in 2007. The provision
    of the Agreement that provides for a release on assignment is s. 7.4(f). It
  states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Franchisee and each of its shareholders, directors
    and officers shall have executed and delivered to Midas a general release of
    any and all claims and causes of action against Midas, its affiliated
  corporations, and their respective officers, agents and employees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]</span><span
lang=EN-US> In
    August 2009, the respondent moved for an order preventing the appellant from
    requiring it to execute a release from the claims certified in the class action
    as a condition of the renewal or transfer of its rights under the Agreement.  The respondent also sought an order declaring
    that any provision requiring class members to release the appellant from
    liability as a condition of renewal or transfer of their rights under the
    Agreement was unenforceable to the extent of some or all of the common issues
  in the proceeding.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his careful and cogent reasons,
    the motion judge considered the issues, the positions of the parties and the
    law in respect of the Act. The motion judge concluded that the respondent was
  entitled to:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>An
    order declaring that any provision contained in the Midas Franchise and Trademark
    Agreement (the “Agreement”) requiring franchisees to release the defendant from
    liability as a condition for the renewal or transfer of their rights under the
  Agreement is unenforceable and void for the purposes of this proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
    the motion judge, the respondent argued that the right of association granted
    to franchisees pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Act encompassed the right of
    franchisees to join in class proceedings with other franchisees for the purpose
    of enforcing their rights against the franchisor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge rejected the appellant’s argument that ss. 4(4) and 11 of the Act could
    not have been intended to apply to agreements and releases in situations where
    the franchisees voluntarily decided to seek renewals, or effect assignments, of
    their Agreements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    paras. 22 and 28 of his reasons, the motion judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    is unquestionable that the provisions and the intentions reflected in such
    agreements are subject to the overriding provisions of the AWA.  In consequence, the fact that Midas is
    seeking compliance with the agreements is beside the point.  If the agreements interfere with the right of
    association conferred by section 4(1), they will be void to that extent.  If they require releases of rights under the
    statute, the releases would be void and the relevant provisions of the
    agreement will be unenforceable. I see no difference in principle between this
    case and any other in which a franchise agreement contains offers of benefits
    to franchisees conditional on the execution of releases of their rights to fair
    dealing under the AWA, or their rights to damages for a breach of the
    franchisor’s obligations under the statute.  It would defeat the purpose of the statute if the obligation of fair
    dealing could be bargained away by such provisions of standard-form franchise
    agreements – whether or not an enquiry would be permitted into the fairness of
    the bargain.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='text-align:center;'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my judgment, if the exercise of a franchisee’s rights under a franchise
    agreement requires a release of rights given by the AWA, the release will, at
    least <i>prima facie</i>, be void by virtue
    of section 11.  I say “<i>prima facie</i>” in order to leave open the
    possibility of cases such as <i>Tutor Time</i>,
    or other circumstances in which it would be inequitable to permit a franchisee
    to rely on that provision of section 11.  In this case, the fact that the franchisee is under no obligation to
    exercise the rights under the agreement appears to me to be of no relevance.
    The case is one where the franchisor is attempting to require the execution of
    a release that would deprive the franchisees of their rights under the
    Act.  In the absence of any circumstances
    that should exclude an application of section 11, I am satisfied that such a
    release would be void and that, in consequence, the agreement to provide it is
    unenforceable.  In my opinion, the
    agreement is also void pursuant to section 4(4) of the AWA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for the appellant’s argument that the Act does not apply to franchisees who
    operate in provinces other than Ontario, the motions judge relied on s. 10.11
    of the Agreement, which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><b><span lang=EN-US>Controlling Law:</span></b><span
lang=EN-US> This Agreement, including all
    matters relating to the validity, construction, performance, and enforcement
    thereof, shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge concluded at paras. 35-36 of  his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    believe the most reasonable inference is that, by agreeing that the laws of
    Ontario are to govern the validity, construction, performance and enforcement
    of a franchise agreement applicable to franchises operating in another
    province, the intention of the parties was that their rights and obligations –
    including the reciprocal and inviolable rights and duties of fair dealing – are
    to be the same as if the business of the franchise was operated in Ontario. The
    territorial limitations in section 2 of the AWA have, in my opinion, no more
    effect for this purpose than that of the general presumption that statutes are
    not “intended to apply extraterritorially to persons, things or events outside
    the boundaries of the enacting jurisdiction” (<i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, (5<sup>th</sup> edition),
    page 731).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
    I find that the validity and enforceability of the impugned provisions of the
    franchise agreements are governed by the overriding provisions of sections 4
    and 11 of the AWA irrespective of the location of the Midas franchises in
    Canada.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

  <h3><span

    decision of Cumming J. in <i>1518628 Ontario

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[106]   Parties who reach a settlement are to be held
    to their bargain. The policy reasons for enforcing a valid release mirror the
    policy principles underlying the doctrines of <i>res judicata</i> and issue estoppel.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[107]   <span class=GramE>The</span> plaintiffs take
    the position the <i>Act</i> prohibits any
    waiver of the statutory right of rescission and hence, the “Release” is of no
    effect, given s. 11 of the <i>Act</i> which
    reads:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>11.Any purported waiver or release by a
    franchisee of a right given under this Act or of an obligation or requirement
    imposed on a franchiser or franchiser’s associate by or under this Act is void.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[108]   In my view, s. 11 does not have application
    to a release given (with the advice of counsel) by a franchisee in the
    settlement of a dispute for existing, known breaches of the <i>Act</i> by the franchiser in respect of its
    disclosure obligations, which would otherwise entitle the franchisee to a
    statutory rescission.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[109]   <span class=GramE>The</span> settlement of a
    claim arising from and consequential to an existing statutory right of
    rescission is not in itself “a waiver or a release” of that statutory right to
    rescission.  It is a release of the claim
    arising from having exercised the right of rescission or being in the position
    to exercise the right of rescission. </span><span style='color:black'>In my view, if a franchisee, as in the instant situation,
    with full knowledge of a breach of the franchiser's obligations to disclose as
    required by the <span class=italic1>Act</span> and regulations, and with the
    benefit of independent legal advice, chooses to affirm the franchise agreement
    as a term of a settlement of the claims that arise from the franchiser's breach,
    then the franchisee can no longer rescind and make a claim to the remedies

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    court in <i>Tutor Time</i> thus
    differentiated between a prospective release <span class=GramE>or</span> waiver
    of a “right” under the <i>AWA</i> and a
    release or waiver of a “<u>claim</u> arising from and consequential to an
    existing statutory <u>right</u>.”  The
    significance, and effect, of the distinction is that franchisees cannot be
    required to contract out of the <i>AWA</i>’s
    protections by releasing a <b><u>right</u></b>.  Franchisees may, however, elect to release
    claims they have asserted, or could assert, under the <i>AWA</i> either to settle those claims or as consideration for obtaining
    some other contractual advantage like the right to renew or assign their
    franchises. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge dealt with this aspect of the appellant’s argument in paras. 24-27
    of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[24] In <i>Tutor
    Time</i> there is no doubt that the release was given for the purpose of an
    agreement that the franchisee intended to be a settlement of its claims based
    on the provisions of the AWA. The franchisee subsequently purported to resile
    from the settlement agreement and, for that purpose, to rely on section
    11.  The learned judge held (at para.
    106) that “parties who reach a settlement are to be held to their bargain” and
    that section 11 was inapplicable in such circumstances. My understanding of the
    reasoning of Cumming J. is that, if there was a settlement that would otherwise
    be binding, section 11 would not apply to a release given pursuant to it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[25] I do not accept that this is a case that
    falls within the ratio of <i>Tutor Time</i>.  The plaintiff is not engaged in settling its
    claims.  On the contrary, this motion is
    made precisely because it wishes to continue to assert them.  The issue is whether in order to obtain
    benefits under the terms of a franchise <span class=GramE>agreement,</span> it can
    be compelled contractually to release rights that it has under the AWA. While
    the overriding effects of the AWA are not limited to cases where franchisors
    are relying on, and attempting to enforce, provisions of a franchise agreement,
    there is no doubt that the statute can apply to such cases.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[26] At times the submissions of defendant’s
    counsel suggested to me that they were seeking to treat any release of an
    existing claim as a settlement and, in consequence, as falling within the ratio
    of <i>Tutor Time</i>.  I do not believe this to be a correct
    interpretation of the decision.  Its
    acceptance would effectively emasculate section 11 of the AWA.  It would, in effect, limit the operation of
    the section to cases where the release covered only claims that might arise in
    the future.  I find nothing in the words
    of section 11 that would support such a narrow interpretation and the general
    objectives of the statute are inimical to it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[27] There may be cases in which the distinction
    is difficult to draw, but I decline to find that the prerequisite of a
    settlement has been satisfied here where the question is whether the franchisor
    can enforce the provisions of the franchise agreements dealing with renewals
    and assignments by insisting on the execution of a release by an unwilling
    franchisee.  Such a release would not be
    given in connection with the settlement of claims asserted in this proceeding,
    and <i>Tutor Time</i> is, in my opinion,
    properly distinguishable on that ground.</span></p>

    agree with the motion judge for the reasons he gave.  <i>Tutor
    Time</i> simply has no application to the facts of this case.  </span>In <i>Tutor
    Time, </i>the motion judge concluded that s. 11 did not apply to a release given
    by a franchisee, with the advice of counsel, in settlement of a dispute for
    existing and fully known breaches of the Act that would otherwise have entitled
    the franchisee to a claim. In the present case, the release that would be part
    of the extension agreement derives from ss. 9.3 and 7.4(f) of the Agreement. Thus,
    this is not a situation analogous to <i>Tutor

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    am of the opinion that, when read in its context in the AWA, the right of
    association in section 4 does encompass the right of franchisees to participate
    in a class action for the purpose of enforcing their rights against the
    franchisor under the statute or otherwise.  Section 4 is not concerned with the right to associate socially or
    recreationally. Its inclusion in the statute would be inexplicable if it was
    not intended to permit franchisees to associate for the purpose of protecting
    their interests and enforcing their rights through collective action.</span></p>

    says that it has never taken the position that the respondent, or any other

    appellant submits that the right to participate in class proceedings was not
    the issue before the motion judge.  The
    issue was whether the release purported to interfere with, prohibit or restrict
    the exercise of the right of association, or whether it was merely the release
    of a claim under the Act asserted through the procedural mechanism of a class
    proceeding.  Although the motion judge
    did not distinguish between rights and claims, the appellant argues that he
    accepted in his decision that rights cannot be interfered with.  Therefore, the appellant submits that if a
    franchisee chooses a contractual option, like renewal or assignment, which
    results in a requirement that it settle claims by providing the appellant with
    a release, then the appellant cannot be said to be interfering with,
    prohibiting or restricting the franchisees’ right of association.  In this regard, it says, there is no
    difference between a franchisee executing a release to secure an existing
    contractual advantage and a decision by a franchisee to opt out of a class
    proceeding under the <i>Class Proceedings
    Act, 1992, </i>S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the “<i>CPA</i>”).</span></p>

    my view, the difference is an obvious one.  The franchisee is required to release existing claims it has under the Act
    as a condition of extending or assigning its Agreement.  Unless it gives up any claims it has, its Agreement
    cannot be extended or assigned.  It is
    nothing like a voluntarily negotiated settlement of existing claims as was the
    case in <i>Tutor Time</i>.  It is quite simply the franchisor relying on
    a term of the franchise agreement – a standard form contract of adhesion – to
    defeat the rights its franchisees would otherwise have under the Act.  To interpret the Agreement in any other way
    is to ignore reality and emasculate the very provisions that are in place in the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I agree with the motion judge and would give no effect

    where the contract is to be carried out. As the respondent notes in its factum:</p>

    words of limitation restrict the application of the order to Agreements where
    the franchisees are members of the class within this proceeding.  In this proceeding all class members assert
    causes of action as set out above in para. 3.  The order provides that if the Agreements of those members come up for
    renewal or assignment during the pendency of the litigation then ss. 7.4(f) and
    9.3 are unenforceable. The appellant therefore cannot insist, as a condition of
    renewal or assignment, that the <span class=GramE>franchisee provide</span> a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><span> </span>5.  Did
    the motion judge err in law in granting substantive relief on a procedural motion?<u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appellant argues that the motion judge erred in
    determining the appellant’s substantive rights on a motion under s. 12 of the <i>CPA</i>. The appellant submits that the
    provisions of the <i>CPA</i> are procedural
    and do not modify or create substantive rights.  Specifically, s. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>CPA </i>is a procedural provision that
    cannot be used to abrogate contractual rights. The provisions of the Agreement providing
    terms and conditions for extension and assignment are substantive rights.  A declaration that affects substantive rights
    is substantive relief. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The motion judge answered the appellant’s objection in para.
    12 of his reasons, wherein he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The motion is concerned essentially with the scope
    of the class.  A franchisee <span
class=GramE>who</span> provides a binding release will automatically be
    excluded from the class.  This is a
    matter that relates to the requirement for certification in section 5(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>CPA</i> and, like the requirements in sections 5(1)(c) through (e), it is not a matter
    to be dealt with in the pleading.  It
    follows that the effect of the AWA might properly have been raised at the
    hearing of the motion to certify the proceeding. The argument on behalf of the
    plaintiff is that the effect of an application of the provisions of section 7.4
    and 9.3 of the franchise agreement that require releases falls squarely within
    section 4(4) as it will prevent a franchisee from exercising its right to
    participate in the class action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As to this issue, I agree with the motion judge for the
    reasons he gave. At its heart, this motion was concerned with the scope of the
    class. It was appropriate for the motion judge to treat it as though it were an
    extension of the certification analysis. There is no error.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  The respondent is entitled to costs of the
    appeal, which I would fix, in accordance with the agreement of counsel, in the
    sum of $34,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
