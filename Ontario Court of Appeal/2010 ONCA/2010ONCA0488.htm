style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On December 15, 2003, the appellant’s motor
    vehicle crossed four lanes of traffic on a busy four-lane road and struck two
    oncoming vehicles.  The passenger in the
    appellant’s vehicle was killed.  Michelle
    Pacheco, the driver of one of the vehicles struck by the appellant’s vehicle,
    suffered significant debilitating injuries.  The appellant was charged with five offences:</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jury returned guilty verdicts on all
    counts.  The trial judge stayed the over
    .08 charge and entered convictions on the other charges.  He subsequently sentenced the appellant to a
    jail term totalling four years and imposed a five-year driving prohibition
    under s. 259 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals from his convictions and
    seeks a new trial.  If that appeal fails,

style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant raises three issues on
    the conviction appeal.  First, he argues
    that the trial judge, having properly determined that the seizure of samples of
    the appellant’s urine violated his constitutional rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, erred in not excluding the urinalysis
    results from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Second, counsel
    submits that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury misstated and denigrated
    crucial features of the case for the defence, rendering the trial unfair.  Third, counsel submits that in the
    circumstances of this case, the rule against multiple convictions arising out
    of the same delict set down in <i>R. v.
    Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 precluded convictions on both the dangerous
    driving charges and the impaired driving charges.  Counsel submits that the dangerous driving
    charges should have been stayed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the sentence appeal, counsel for the
    appellant acknowledges the seriousness of the offences.  He submits, however, that having regard to
    the appellant’s truly exemplary background and the heartfelt plea for mercy
    made by members of the deceased’s family, a four-year penitentiary term is
    harsh and grossly disproportionate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the conviction appeal.  The trial judge did not err in concluding
    that the urinalysis results should not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The charge to the jury was fair and, in my view, accurately put the case
    for both the Crown and the defence.  I
    agree with the trial judge’s finding that the rule in <i>Kienapple</i> did not preclude a conviction both for impaired driving
    and for driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public.  The former speaks to the risk posed by the impairment
    of accused’s ability to drive, while the latter addresses the risk caused by
    the manner in which the accused actually drove.<span style='color:red'>    </span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the sentence appeal.  The trial judge was faced with a very
    difficult sentencing problem.  Having
    read his reasons and given the matter anxious consideration, I would defer to
    his conclusion that a four-year penitentiary term was necessary to properly
    reflect the competing, if not irreconcilable, interests at stake in the
    sentencing phase of these proceedings.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Different parts of the evidence presented
    starkly different pictures of the appellant’s sobriety at the time of the
    accident.  On the one hand, there was evidence
    - particularly the results of the urine and blood analyses - indicating that
    the appellant was very drunk when he drove his vehicle across four lanes of
    traffic with disastrous consequences.  On
    the other hand, there was evidence from several witnesses that the appellant
    was not impaired and that he had little, if anything, to drink in the six hours
    before the accident.  The appellant did
    not testify.  The jury had the difficult
    task of examining the conflicting evidence and deciding whether the Crown had
    proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On December 15, 2003, the appellant, a former
    professional hockey player and an active member of the National Hockey League
    Alumni Association, attended the funeral of a friend and former colleague.  After the funeral, he went to a reception at
    a local golf course.  He was there for
    several hours.  At about 4:30 p.m., the
    appellant left the reception, intending to drive to a meeting of the Alumni
    Association.  Keith Magnuson, the
    appellant’s good friend, a former professional hockey player and a member of
    the Alumni Association, accompanied the appellant.  The meeting was several miles southeast of
    the golf course where the reception was held.  The defence called seven witnesses who had had contact with the
    appellant at the reception following the funeral.  None observed any signs of impairment.  One witness, Andy Bathgate, spoke with the
    appellant at some length around one half hour before the accident.  He noticed that the appellant had a glass of
    wine in his hand, but saw nothing to indicate any degree of impairment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At about 5:00 p.m., the appellant’s vehicle was
    travelling eastbound in the curb lane on Rutherford Road, a four-lane east/west
    roadway.  The weather was clear.  It was dusk but visibility was good.  The road was dry.  Traffic was steady but not heavy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a gentle curve in the road, the appellant’s
    vehicle travelled straight across both eastbound lanes into the westbound lanes
    of Rutherford Road.  It struck a Honda,
    sheering off the back bumper.  No one in
    the Honda was hurt.  The appellant’s
    vehicle then struck a Nissan Pathfinder head on, virtually destroying that
    vehicle.  Ms. Pacheco, the driver of the
    Nissan, suffered significant but not life-threatening injuries.  The appellant’s vehicle ricocheted off the Nissan
    and came to rest at the guardrail.  The
    front half of the appellant’s vehicle was demolished.  Both the appellant and Mr. Magnuson were
    trapped inside.  Mr. Magnuson died at the
    scene.  The appellant suffered significant
    lower body injuries and a concussion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown contended that the path taken by the appellant’s
    vehicle across the four lanes of traffic suggested that he was intoxicated.  On the evidence, particularly that of the
    witness driving behind the appellant, the appellant’s vehicle took a straight
    diagonal path across the four lanes.  He
    did not apply the brakes and did not take any evasive action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defence led evidence that the path of the
    vehicle could be explained by a mechanical problem that caused the left front
    wheel to lock.  I need not set out the
    specifics of that evidence.  A Crown
    expert, who examined the vehicle shortly after the accident and well before the
    defence expert, concluded that it was in good mechanical condition.  The Crown expert also testified that even if
    the front left wheel had locked, the appellant would not have been prevented
    entirely from steering the vehicle.  The
    expert also indicated that any problem there may have been with the left front
    wheel would not explain the appellant’s failure to apply the brakes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A number of emergency responders and police
    officers arrived at the scene shortly after the accident.  The appellant was initially unconscious but
    soon regained consciousness, although he seemed confused.  He was in obvious physical distress and had
    to be extracted from the vehicle.  The
    appellant was concerned about his passenger, whom he mistakenly identified as
    Gary Leeman.  There was expert evidence
    that the concussion suffered by the appellant could explain his apparent confusion,
    especially as to the identity of his passenger.  He apparently confused Mr. Magnuson with Mr. Leeman, a friend and former
    teammate who, like Mr. Magnuson, had red hair and had attended the reception
    earlier that day.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several of the first responders noted the smell
    of alcohol in the vehicle.  The appellant
    had purchased some beer earlier that day.  There were two or three unopened but empty beer cans in the
    vehicle.  It would appear that the cans exploded
    on impact inside the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several witnesses also noted the smell of
    alcohol on the appellant’s breath.  The
    odour of alcohol on one’s breath is some indication of the consumption of
    alcohol, but no indication of the amount consumed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two of the police officers at the scene noted
    that the appellant’s eyes were glassy and red, and that his pupils were
    dilated.  The emergency responders who
    attended to the appellant made no such observations.  Counsel for the appellant vigorously
    challenged the reliability of the officers’ testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police officer who accompanied the appellant
    to the hospital in the back of the ambulance testified that the appellant made
    two statements that indicated he had been drinking.  At one point after stating that he needed to
    urinate, he said, “[I]t’s all the drinking”.  Later, as the appellant was going into the hospital on a stretcher, he said,
    “Oh no, this shouldn’t be, this is the booze”.  The paramedics who were in the back of the ambulance with the police
    officer and the appellant did not hear the appellant make the remarks attributed
    to him by the police officer, nor did they hear him say anything about “the
    booze” on the way into the hospital.  They testified that their concern was the appellant’s physical well-being,
    not what he may have said.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once the appellant was in the hospital, Ms.
    Ramsay, an emergency room nurse, performed a full neurological assessment.  Ms. Ramsay was concerned about any possible head
    injury.  She was also concerned about
    alcohol consumption, which could impact on subsequent medical decisions.  Nothing in either her observations of the
    appellant or her interactions with him suggested to Ms. Ramsay that he had
    consumed alcohol.  She drew a blood
    sample for medical purposes but saw no need to request a blood alcohol analysis
    of that sample.  A request for a blood alcohol
    analysis was made by the hospital personnel sometime after Ms. Ramsay drew the
    blood sample.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Ramsay took the blood sample at about 7:25
    p.m.  It was taken exclusively for
    medical reasons.  Part of that blood
    sample was analyzed for blood alcohol content at the hospital laboratory.  The police later seized the results of that
    analysis.  The analysis done in the
    hospital lab produced a blood alcohol content reading of .224.  According to the expert testimony, this reading
    would indicate a blood alcohol level between .229 and .274 at the time of the
    accident, about two and one half hours earlier.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The unused portion of the blood sample taken
    from the appellant for medical reasons was lawfully seized with a warrant by the
    police and analyzed at the Centre of Forensic Sciences.  That analysis produced a blood alcohol level
    of .242, indicating a blood alcohol level at the time of the accident between
    .247 and .292.  The expert testified that
    the readings produced by the analyses at the hospital lab and the Centre of
    Forensic Sciences were consistent “considering <span class=GramE>it’s</span> two different people analyzing the results using two different types of
    instruments”.</p>

    plastic container provided by the hospital staff.  P.C. Cole, who had custody of the appellant
    at that time, transferred some of the urine from the container into two
    vials.  He seized the vials of urine and
    later delivered them to the Centre of Forensic Sciences for analysis.  That analysis yielded a reading of 282
    milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of urine.  That reading is the equivalent of a blood alcohol
    reading of .217 at the time of urination.  </p>

    P.C. Cole’s custody, urinated a second time.  P.C. Cole also seized two vials of that urine and delivered them to the
    Centre of Forensic Sciences for analysis.  That analysis produced a reading of 237 milligrams of alcohol per 100
    millilitres of urine.  Taken together,
    the two samples indicated that around 9:46 p.m., the mid-point between the two
    collections, the appellant had a blood alcohol reading of .182.  That reading translates to a blood alcohol
    level between .212 and .282 at the time of the accident.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>James Wigmore, a toxicologist called by the
    Crown, testified that the analyses of the blood samples and urine samples
    indicated a significant level of impairment at the time of the accident (about
    5:00 p.m.).  According to Mr. Wigmore,
    the anticipated level of impairment would disrupt vision and slow one’s ability
    to react.  He also testified that at the
    levels indicated by the various analyses, individuals would usually, but not
    inevitably, display obvious signs of impairment such as slurred speech and a
    staggered gait.  Mr. Wigmore testified
    that the indicia of impairment such as slurred speech could be less apparent in
    a person who had developed a high tolerance for alcohol, but that the driving
    ability of that person would be substantially impaired at the blood alcohol
    levels indicated by the analyses of the various samples taken from the
    appellant.<span style='color:red'>  </span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='page-break-after:avoid'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Wigmore was presented with various
    hypothetical situations concerning the amount that an individual would have had
    to consume to produce blood alcohol readings like those found in this
    case.  He opined that a person with the
    appellant’s physical characteristics and an average rate of alcohol elimination
    would have had to consume between 15 and 20 bottles of beer between 11:30 a.m.
    and 4:30 p.m. to produce the blood alcohol levels indicated in the analyses of
    the blood and urine samples taken from the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defence contended that all of the samples
    were tainted.  Mr. Wigmore acknowledged
    that the alcohol swab used to clean the area before the blood sample was taken
    could, if a “sloppy technique” was used, contaminate the subsequent blood alcohol
    readings obtained from the sample.  The
    defence pointed out that when Ms. Ramsay took the blood sample she had not
    requested a blood alcohol analysis and, therefore, had no reason to be careful
    in using the alcohol swab to prepare the area around the injection.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was also the possibility that both of the containers
    into which the appellant urinated were somehow contaminated.  As the Crown points out in its factum, however,
    the defence contamination theory suffered in light of the consistency among the
    four analyses of three different samples – one blood sample and two urine
    samples – taken at three different times and analyzed in two different laboratories.  </p>

    at the preliminary inquiry.  The crucial
    evidence came from P.C. Cole.  He
    testified that he arrived at the hospital at about 7:32 p.m., some two and one
    half hours after the accident.  P.C. Cole
    was a qualified breathalyzer operator and had a portable breathalyzer machine
    with him.  He hoped to be able to obtain

    told that the appellant had been given morphine and that a blood sample had
    been taken from him for medical purposes.   P.C. Cole took steps to locate and preserve that sample for the purposes
    of seizure at some subsequent point.  Shortly
    after arriving at the hospital, P.C. Cole was told that because of the
    appellant’s condition, it would not be possible for him to obtain a breath
    sample from the appellant.  </p>

    his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights twice,

    p.m.  As was his practice whenever he
    assumed control of an accused person, P.C. Cole advised the appellant of his right
    to counsel pursuant to s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Some discussion with the appellant ensued, during
    which the appellant said that he did not understand the rights that had been
    given to him by P.C. Cole.  P.C. Cole
    testified that, after some questioning of the appellant, he became satisfied
    that the appellant did understand what he had been told.  It is unnecessary to explore this part of the
    evidence as there was no allegation at trial, and there is no allegation on
    appeal, of any breach of the appellant’s rights under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

    directly into the container.  He asked the
    appellant, “Do you mind if I have some of your urine?”  The appellant replied, “Yeah, yeah.”  P.C. Cole obtained two vials from the
    hospital personnel and transferred some of the urine from the green plastic
    container into the vials.</p>

    counsel a second time, shortly after seizing the sample of his urine. P.C. Cole
    thought that the appellant seemed more coherent than he had seemed when P.C.
    Cole had initially told him of his right to counsel.  The appellant asked for his address book, and
    told P.C. Cole that his lawyer’s information was in that book.</p>

    spoke to the appellant’s brother, who had arrived at the hospital.  P.C. Cole, with the brother’s help, was able

    time.  As on the first occasion, he
    urinated into a plastic container given to him by the hospital personnel.  Again, as on the first occasion, P.C. Cole
    transferred samples of that urine into two vials.  However, on this occasion, P.C. Cole did not
    ask the appellant whether he could take a sample of the urine.  P.C. Cole testified that he believed the prior

    P.C. Cole at about 8:50 p.m. and 10:38 p.m. were eventually analyzed at the
    Centre of Forensic Sciences.  The results
    of those analyses indicated that the appellant had a very high blood alcohol level
    at the time of the accident.  The results
    were consistent with the results obtained from the blood alcohol analyses of
    the blood samples taken from the appellant.  There was no challenge to the admissibility of the blood samples and the

  <h2>(b)  The Ruling</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge considered the admissibility of
    the urine samples and the urinalysis results using the three-part test set down
    in a series of cases from the Supreme Court of Canada beginning with <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  He also relied on the then recent
    pronouncement of this court in <i>R. v.
    Grant</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the purposes of considering trial fairness, the
    first factor identified in <i>Collins</i>, the
    trial judge characterized the samples as conscriptive evidence, but went on to
    hold that the samples would inevitably have been obtained by non-conscriptive
    means, namely, a search warrant.  The
    trial judge observed that the urinalysis results were reliable evidence and
    that their admission would not adversely affect the truth-seeking function at
    trial.  Relying on the analysis undertaken
    by this court in <i>Grant</i>, he concluded
    that trial fairness would not be adversely affected despite the conscriptive
    nature of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addressing the seriousness of the breach, the
    second of the three <i>Collins</i> factors,
    the trial judge rejected P.C. Cole’s testimony that he believed the appellant
    had genuinely consented to P.C. Cole’s taking of samples of his urine.  The trial judge described himself as “skeptical
    of this explanation.”  He went on,
    however, to indicate that P.C. Cole was entitled to be in the room with the
    appellant, that he had done nothing to cause the appellant to urinate, and that
    P.C. Cole had merely collected and preserved what he knew could be potentially
    relevant evidence.  The trial judge
    described this intrusion upon the appellant’s bodily integrity as “minimal”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, with respect to the third factor
    identified in <i>Collins</i>, the impact on
    the administration of justice of excluding the evidence, the trial judge noted
    that the evidence was “highly probative”.  The trial judge ultimately held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Given the seriousness of the charges, the importance
    of the evidence to the Crown case, and the less intrusive nature of the s. 8 <span
class=GramE>breach</span>, excluding the results of the urine sample would
    bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  </p>
  <h2>            (c)  Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After the trial but before this appeal, the
    Supreme Court of Canada, in <i>R. v. Grant</i>,
    [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, reformulated the approach to be taken when determining the
    admissibility of evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  That reformulation
    applies on appeal:  <i>R. v. Blake</i> (2010), 251 C.C.C. (3d) 4 (Ont. C.A.).  In addressing this ground of appeal, however,
    I bear in mind that while the approach to the determination of admissibility has
    been reworked in <i>Grant</i>, the factors relevant
    to the admissibility inquiry have not changed:  <i>R. v. Beaulieu</i> (2010), 251
    C.C.C. (3d) 455 (S.C.C.) at para. 7.  Further, even though the s. 24(2) analysis on appeal is somewhat
    different in light of <i>Grant</i>,
    deference is still owed to the trial judge’s fact-finding and balancing of the relevant
    factors:  <i> Beaulieu </i>at para. 5; <i>R. v. Wong</i> (2010), 253 C.C.C. (3d) 315 (B.C.C.A.)
    at para. 55.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the approach outlined in <i>Grant</i>, the court must consider:</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before applying the <i>Grant</i> criteria, it is necessary to accurately describe the nature
    of the police conduct in issue.  This is
    not a case involving the seizure of anything from the appellant’s person, much
    less from inside his body.  Neither the
    appellant nor the medical personnel ever asked P.C. Cole to leave the room.   There is no suggestion that P.C. Cole’s
    presence interfered with the appellant’s medical treatment or his privacy.  P.C. Cole also did nothing to cause the
    appellant to urinate or to remove the urine from the appellant’s body.  P.C. Cole stood by and allowed nature to take
    its course.  Because the appellant was in
    custody, P.C. Cole was able to secure the appellant’s bodily waste product
    after the appellant had urinated but before the urine was discarded. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The seizure of the urine sample by P.C. Cole is
    comparable to the seizure of the discarded tissue in <i>R. v. Stillman</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607.  In that case, the accused, while in police
    custody, blew his nose and then threw the tissue away.  The police seized the tissue from the garbage
    and ultimately retrieved DNA from that tissue.  In ruling that the tissue and the subsequent analysis were admissible,
    Cory J., for the majority, contrasted the seizure of the tissue containing the
    accused’s mucus with the forced seizure from the accused of hair samples,
    dental impressions, and a sample of his saliva.  He said at para. 128:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In contrast to the hair samples, teeth impressions
    and buccal swabs, the <u>police did not force, or even request, a mucous sample
    from the appellant.  He blew his nose of
    his own accord.</u>  The police acted
    surreptitiously in disregard for the appellant’s explicit refusal to provide
    them with bodily samples.  <u>However,
    the violation of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights with respect to the tissue was not serious.  The seizure did not interfere with the
    appellant’s bodily integrity, nor cause him any loss of dignity.</u>  [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My characterization of the nature of the police conduct
    in seizing the urine samples is not intended to suggest that the appellant did
    not have a legitimate privacy interest in the urine samples.  Clearly, the appellant had a legitimate
    interest in preserving the privacy of information embedded in his urine samples,
    including information pertaining to his blood alcohol level:  see <i>Stillman</i> at paras. 52-63; <i>R. v. Patrick</i>, [2009]
    1 S.C.R. 579 at para. 13.  The Crown
    recognizes this privacy interest by acknowledging the s. 8 breach.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first component of the <i>Grant</i> analysis, the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i>- infringing state conduct, looks both at what the police
    did and their attitude when they did it.  Respect for the justice system must suffer in the long term if courts
    routinely admit evidence gathered by state conduct that disregards individual
    rights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.C. Cole took samples of the appellant’s urine
    on two occasions without any authority for doing so.  He could have secured those samples by
    requesting that the hospital hold them pending the production of a warrant.  I have no doubt that if P.C. Cole had applied
    for a search warrant, the application would have been granted, and P.C. Cole
    could then have secured the samples in a manner that respected the appellant’s
    constitutional rights.  Had he done so,
    those samples would have been analyzed and would have produced exactly the same
    evidence relied on by the Crown.  Looking
    strictly at what P.C. Cole failed to do, I do not think his conduct demonstrates
    the kind of disregard for individual rights that would be seen, in the long
    term, as posing a significant threat to the public confidence in the due
    administration of criminal justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.C. Cole’s attitude towards the appellant’s
    rights does raise concerns.  P.C. Cole
    said he acted on the authority of the appellant’s consent.  The ineffectiveness of that consent was so
    obvious that the Crown did not attempt to rely on the consent at trial.  The trial judge, somewhat charitably, described
    himself as “skeptical” of P.C. Cole’s evidence that he believed he had the
    necessary informed consent.  It seems
    obvious to me that P.C. Cole, who was alert to the need to obtain evidence
    relating to the appellant’s blood alcohol level, simply decided to take a
    shortcut to get the urine samples.  He
    took advantage of the appellant, who was under his control and in significant
    physical discomfort.  P.C. Cole’s
    attitude shows little respect for the appellant’s <br>
    individual rights and renders the <i>Charter</i>-infringing
    state conduct more serious than it would otherwise have been.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second component of the <i>Grant</i> inquiry, the impact on the <i>Charter</i>-protected interests of the accused, requires that the court
    bear in mind that the long-term respect for the administration of justice will
    be undermined if the court appears to ignore significant intrusions upon
    individual rights when deciding whether the evidentiary fruit of a <i>Charter </i>breach should be received at
    trial.  The trial judge found that the
    intrusion into the appellant’s <i>Charter</i>-protected
    interests was relatively minimal.  The
    appellant’s continued privacy interest in the information to be gleaned from
    his discarded bodily waste is well-removed from the essential core of personal
    privacy.  The appellant gave up his waste
    product without any state compulsion or interference.  The appellant’s privacy interest is further
    diminished in that P.C. Cole could have segregated the sample of the appellant’s
    urine and obtained a warrant to seize that sample.  Had he done so, the appellant’s privacy
    interest in that sample would inevitably have yielded to the state’s more
    powerful investigatory interest.  The
    police would have obtained and analyzed the sample, resulting in exactly the
    same evidence that was adduced at trial.  The second component of the <i>Grant</i> inquiry favours admissibility.</p>

    far-reaching and strenuous attack on the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  He contends that, read as a whole, the
    instructions do not fairly or accurately present the various arguments put
    forward by the defence or the evidence supporting those arguments.  Counsel submits that the instructions were tilted
    in favour of the Crown in various ways, including the trial judge’s use of
    rhetorical questions to denigrate evidence relied on by the defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not propose to examine each of the complaints
    relating to the instructions individually.  I will, however, address the submissions made concerning the trial
    judge’s treatment of the evidence of Ms. Ramsay, the emergency room nurse.  These submissions are representative of the
    other submissions made in support of the contention that the charge was
    unfair.  </p>

    defence.  I have summarized her evidence
    earlier in these reasons (see paras. 19-20).  At the end of the charge, counsel for the appellant raised various
    factual errors that the trial judge had made in his instructions.  Some involved Ms. Ramsay’s evidence.  The trial judge recharged the jury.  He specifically drew the jury’s attention to
    the factual errors he had made in respect of Ms. Ramsay’s evidence.  He then accurately reviewed those parts of
    her evidence with the jury.  By the end
    of the recharge, the jury had an accurate summary of Ms. Ramsay’s evidence and,
    I am sure, a full appreciation of its importance to the defence.  </p>

    judge’s instructions to the jury are without merit and need not be examined in
    any detail.  Some were specifically
    addressed in the trial judge’s recharge.  For example, the appellant complains that the defence theory concerning
    the contamination of the containers used to collect the urine was not put to
    the jury.  The trial judge specifically
    reminded the jury of the defence theory concerning contamination in his
    recharge.  Other complaints raised on
    this appeal go to the extent to which the trial judge repeated the arguments
    made by counsel.  No doubt, the trial
    judge could have said more about any particular defence argument, or referred
    in more detail to the evidence relied on by the defence.  The same could be said about his description
    of the Crown’s arguments and the evidence relied on by the Crown.  The failure to put the defence case or the Crown
    case exactly the way counsel want it put, and the failure to refer to all of
    the evidence that could assist one side or the other is not reversible
    error.  The important point is that the

    information needed to decide the difficult questions that lay between the jury

  <h2>The Application of the Rule in <i>Kienapple</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In <i>Kienapple</i>, the court declared that the <i>res judicata</i> principle would in some
    circumstances preclude multiple convictions arising out of the same delict.  Since that pronouncement, the courts have
    struggled with the scope of the rule in <i>Kienapple</i>:
    see, for example, <i>R. v. R.K.</i> (2005),
    198 C.C.C. (3d) 232 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 41-56<span class=GramE>.  That</span> struggle, as pointed out by
    Martland J. in his dissent in <i>Kienapple</i> at p. 731, is often of academic interest only, as its outcome has no impact on
    the actual sentence to be served by the accused.  This case is typical in that the appellant’s
    sentence will not be affected, even if the rule in <i>Kienapple </i>applies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is common ground that the appellant is
    properly convicted of at least one offence in relation to each victim.  The question is whether he should be
    convicted of both a dangerous driving related offence and an impaired driving related
    offence in respect of both victims.  If <i>Kienapple</i> applies, the appellant should
    have two, instead of four, entries in his criminal record.  However, because the trial judge imposed
    concurrent sentences on the two charges relating to each victim, the
    application of <i>Kienapple</i> would have
    no effect on the total length of the sentence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel referred the court to three appellate
    decisions that have considered the application of <i>Kienapple</i> to charges involving dangerous driving (or criminally
    negligent driving) and impaired driving:  see <i>R. v. Colby</i> (1989), 52
    C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Alta. C.A.); <i>R. v.
    Galloway</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 305 (Sask. C.A.); and <i>R. v. Andrew</i> (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 301 (B.C.C.A.).  <i>Colby</i> supports the appellant’s position.  In <i>Colby</i>, the court applied <i>Kienapple</i> to charges of dangerous
    driving causing death and impaired driving causing death.  The court reasoned at p. 332: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the present case, the act of the accused which
    amounts to dangerous driving is operating her motor vehicle while her ability
    to do so was substantially impaired by alcohol.  In the <u>tragic circumstances, that delict founds the conviction for
    dangerous driving causing death.  Precisely the same wrongful act founds the further count of impaired
    driving causing death.</u>  There are no
    “additional distinguishing features” of that count as compared to the
    other.  In my view, the <i>Kienapple</i> principle applies and
    convictions cannot be entered on both counts.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Galloway</i>,
    the accused faced the same charges faced by the appellant in this case.  The trial judge declined to apply <i>Kienapple</i> and entered convictions on
    both the dangerous driving charges and the impaired driving charges.  The appeal court distinguished <i>Colby</i> on its facts, noting at para. 123
    that, in <i>Colby</i>, there was “no
    evidence of erratic driving other than the fact of the accident”.  In <i>Galloway</i>,
    there was evidence of very erratic driving prior to the accident.  The court in <i>Galloway</i> also observed that the offences of dangerous driving and
    impaired driving were legally distinct.  The court held at para. 125:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On a clear reading of the statutory provisions
    creating the separate offences under s. 249 and s. 253, we find that Parliament
    intended to punish two different acts.  There is no doubt that a factual nexus exists with respect to proof of
    the certain elements in each offence in this case.   But when one comes to the legal nexus there
    are distinguishing elements which preclude application of the <i>Kienapple</i> principle.  Although the manner of driving can assist in
    proof of impairment, the offence is “driving while impaired”.  This does not necessarily involve dangerous
    or erratic driving.  Conversely dangerous
    driving can be demonstrated by evidence of the manner of driving without proof
    of impairment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Andrew</i>,
    the British Columbia Court of Appeal struck a five-judge panel to consider
    conflicting decisions from that court as to the application of <i>Kienapple</i> in situations involving
    criminally negligent or dangerous driving, and impaired driving.  The court had no difficulty determining that,
    on the facts in <i>Andrew</i>, there were
    two discrete offences.  The accused drove
    erratically, causing at least one accident well before hitting a vehicle and
    causing significant injuries to the occupant of that vehicle.  The court also emphasized the distinction
    between offences based on the manner in which a person drives and offences based
    on the impairment of one’s capacity to drive.  The court said at p. 307:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Those facts establish that there was not just one
    wrongful act in this case.  <u>The reason
    is that impairment of capacity followed by driving, which is the wrongful act
    in impaired driving, does not encompass the manner of driving, which in this
    case formed a part of the sequence of actions which constituted criminal
    negligence.  Nor, in this case,
    considering the offences in the context of the facts, can the element of
    driving after becoming impaired <span class=GramE>be</span> considered merely as
    a particularization of the element of wanton and reckless conduct underlying
    criminal negligence.</u>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the distinction between the
    offences of impaired driving and dangerous driving (or criminal negligence)
    drawn in <i>Galloway</i> and <i>Andrew</i>.  An impaired driving charge focuses on an accused’s ability to operate a
    motor vehicle or, more specifically, on whether that ability was impaired by
    the consumption of alcohol or some other drug.  A dangerous driving charge focuses on the manner in which the accused
    drove and, in particular, whether it presented a danger to the public having
    regard to the relevant circumstances identified in s. 249 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The driver’s impairment may explain why he or
    she drove the vehicle in a dangerous manner, but impairment is not an element
    of the offence.  Both impaired driving
    and dangerous driving address road safety, a pressing societal concern.  They do so, however, by focussing on
    different dangers posed to road safety.  Impaired driving looks to the driver’s ability to operate the vehicle, while
    dangerous driving looks to the manner in which the driver actually operated the
    vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Andrew</i>,
    the court acknowledged that <i>Kienapple</i> had been applied in cases where there was no evidence of the manner of driving
    apart from the accident that produced the injuries or death. The court, at p.
    308, expressed some doubt as to the correctness of those decisions.  I, too, doubt their correctness.  I do not regard an allegation that the
    accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol or some other drug as merely
    a particularization of the allegation that he or she drove dangerously.<span
style='color:red'>  </span>As I have
    tried to explain, the two allegations address different issues.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, on the version of events that the
    jury must have accepted, the appellant committed the crime of impaired driving
    when he got into his vehicle at the golf course where the reception was held
    and drove off towards his meeting many miles away.  The driving that precipitated the allegation
    of dangerous driving occurred about a half an hour later, when the appellant
    drove across four lanes of traffic into oncoming vehicles.  This criminal conduct cannot be described as
    a single delict.  To the extent that <i>Colby</i> suggests that it can be described
    in this manner, I must, with respect, disagree.  Even if one could imagine a case where the factual allegations
    supporting the charge of impaired driving are the same as the factual
    allegations supporting the charge of dangerous driving, that is not this
    case.  The trial judge correctly held
    that <i>Kienapple</i> had no
    application.    <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the end of his careful and detailed reasons
    for sentence, the trial judge aptly described the difficult task he faced in
    sentencing the appellant:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>My responsibility in this matter is to impose a
    sentence on an offender who is an exemplary citizen, who has committed a
    serious crime with tragic <span class=GramE>consequences ...</span> .  It is not an easy task but the message of
    general deterrence must be met.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge proceeded to impose sentences
    totalling four years.  He also imposed a
    five-year driving prohibition.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court’s power to vary a sentence on appeal
    is found in s. 687(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  That section tells the court
    to examine the “fitness” of the sentence imposed at trial.  The controlling jurisprudence directs that an
    appellate court must defer to the sentencing decision made at trial unless the
    appellate court is convinced that there is an error in principle or that the
    sentence is demonstrably unfit:  <i>R. v. M.(C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at
    para. 90; <i>R. v. L.M.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R.
    163 at para. 14.  Counsel for the
    appellant focussed primarily on the second of the two bases upon which this
    court can interfere with the sentence imposed at trial.   Counsel submitted that while a four-year
    sentence was within the appropriate range for these offences, the sentence was “entirely
    disproportionate” given the appellant’s exemplary background and the position
    taken by the Magnuson family.  I take
    this to be an argument that, in the circumstances, the sentence was manifestly
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Appellate deference to the trial judge’s
    sentencing decision makes good sense.  Sentencing is a fact-specific exercise of judicial discretion.  It is anything but an exact science.  In the vast majority of cases, there is no
    single sentence that is clearly preferable to all others.  Instead, there is a range of reasonable
    options from which the trial judge must make his or her selection.  That selection is driven by the judge’s
    evaluation of the sentence that best reflects his or her assessment of the
    combined effect of the many variables inevitably at play when imposing a sentence.  Absent the discipline of deference, sentence
    appeals would invite the appellate court to repeat the same exercise performed
    by the trial judge, with no realistic prospect that the appellate court would
    arrive at a more appropriate sentence.  Appellate
    repetition of the exercise of judicial discretion by the trial judge, without
    any reason to think that the second effort will improve upon the results of the
    first, is a misuse of judicial resources.  The exercise also delays the final resolution of the criminal process,
    without any countervailing benefit to the process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A deferential standard of review on sentence
    appeals also recognizes that a trial judge has an advantage over the appellate
    court when it comes to balancing the competing interests at play in sentencing.  The trial judge gains an appreciation of the
    relevant events and an insight into the participants in those events -
    particularly the accused - that cannot be revealed by appellate review of a
    transcript.  For example, in this case,
    the appellant’s remorse was accepted as genuine; however, at no time did he
    offer any explanation for what had happened.  The trial judge was much better positioned than this court to evaluate
    these arguably inconsistent features of the appellant’s response to the tragic
    events.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Deference is justified for a third reason.  The sentencing judge represents and speaks
    for the community that has suffered the consequences of the crime.  He or she is much better placed to determine
    the sentence needed to adequately protect the community than is an appellate
    court sitting at a distant place often years removed from the relevant events.  As explained in <i>M. (C.A.)</i> at para. 91:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will
    normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the
    consequences of the offender’s crime.  As
    such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of
    sentencing goals that will be “just and appropriate” for the protection of that
    community.  The determination of a just
    and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully
    the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the
    offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into
    account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would think the trial judge’s ability to gauge
    the interests of the community was particularly important to his decision that
    a conditional sentence would be inappropriate.  Counsel for the appellant made a forceful argument that with the
    appropriate terms, a conditional sentence could meet the needs of general
    deterrence and denunciation.  The trial
    judge was in the best position to assess the merits of that submission, having
    regard to his perception of the community’s legitimate expectations.  I would add that the trial judge’s
    determination that a sentence of more than two years was required rendered moot
    any consideration of a conditional sentence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In imposing sentence, the trial judge identified
    general deterrence as the predominant concern.  In doing so, he correctly applied this court’s judgment in <i>R. v. McVeigh</i> (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145
    (Ont. C.A.).  In that judgment, now
    almost 25 years old, this court made it clear that drinking and driving related
    offences were serious crimes and must be treated as such by the courts.  In the memorable words of MacKinnon A.C.J.O. at
    p. 150, “every drinking driver is a potential killer”.  Unfortunately, that potential was realized in
    this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>McVeigh</i> also recognizes that many persons who commit serious crimes while drinking and
    driving will be otherwise good citizens who have never been involved with the
    criminal law.  Even in those cases,
    however, <i>McVeigh</i> indicates that
    general deterrence is of primary importance.  The result in <i>McVeigh</i> demonstrates the court’s commitment to general deterrence in all cases
    involving drinking and driving, especially those in which a death occurs.  McVeigh, a 31-year old first offender, had
    his sentence increased from 21 months to three years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted by the trial judge, there were aggravating
    factors in this case.  The appellant’s
    blood alcohol level was very high, well beyond the blood alcohol level of .160
    deemed by statute to be an aggravating factor:  s. 255.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The readings leave no doubt that the
    appellant was significantly impaired.  As
    he drove along the road, he presented an immediate and very real danger to
    hundreds of people.  Given the
    appellant’s very high blood alcohol level and his inevitable degree of
    impairment, the appellant must have known of the risk he posed to all around
    him when he chose to leave the reception and drive to his destination.  The danger created by the appellant’s conduct
    is not unlike that created by a drunken man who walks down a busy street firing
    a handgun at random.  The community,
    quite properly, demands that the courts denounce and deter such reckless and
    dangerous conduct.  Significant
    incarceration is the remedy that most emphatically achieves those goals.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing process is, of course, not just
    about the offence.  It is also about the
    offender.  The trial judge was alive to
    the many mitigating factors in this case.  Not only is the appellant a first offender, but he is also an
    outstanding member of the community. The letters filed on his behalf on
    sentencing are a tribute to a life well led by the appellant.  He is a dedicated father and husband.  The appellant’s remorse is real and
    deep.  He will probably never forgive
    himself for what has happened to his friend, Mr. Magnuson, although the Magnuson
    family has forgiven him and asked the trial judge to not incarcerate the appellant.  The trial judge fully canvassed the “moving
    and rare” position taken by the Magnuson family and properly considered their
    request as one of the many factors that were relevant to his determination of
    an appropriate sentence.  He likewise
    gave full and proper consideration to the victim impact statement of Ms.
    Pacheco.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s convictions and resulting sentence
    will also have a significant impact on his ability to continue to live and work
    in the United States, where he has lived for many years.  The trial judge was advised that once
    sentenced, the appellant, who is not an American citizen, will be barred from
    re-entry into the United States subject to gaining re-entry through a complicated
    and difficult process.  The appellant’s
    future may not be in the United States, where he has lived and raised a family
    for many years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have read and reread all of the material filed
    on sentencing.  As the trial judge
    observed, counsel for the Crown and counsel for the appellant both made
    excellent presentations on sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Initially, I was inclined to the view that the sentence
    appeal should be allowed on the basis that the appellant’s exemplary life,
    other than this event, entitled him to the lowest possible period of
    incarceration that would adequately reflect the need for general deterrence and
    denunciation.    I thought that a
    penitentiary sentence of less than four years would achieve that purpose.  Further consideration has, however, led me to
    conclude that were I to take that approach, I would not be giving the trial
    judge’s decision the deference it is due.  There is no error in principle here.  Nor, in light of <i>McVeigh</i> and the
    relevant jurisprudence, can it be said that a four-year sentence is manifestly
    unreasonable.  This court must yield to
    the trial judge’s determination as to the appropriate sentence absent an error
    in principle or a manifestly unreasonable decision.  I would add that deferring is made much
    easier by the trial judge’s thorough reasons, which demonstrate a keen appreciation
    of all of the factors relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence
    in this very difficult case.  </p>

    (5th) 235 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 6(v), the trial judge mistakenly indicates that
