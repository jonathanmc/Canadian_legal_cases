style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Terra Nova Systems Inc. (“Terra
    Nova”), appeals from the trial judgment dismissing its action against the
    respondent, R&amp;M United Trade and Network Inc. (“R&amp;M”), for damages
    arising from breach of contract and against the remaining respondents for
    damages arising from negligent misrepresentations relating to the sale of
    goods.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra Nova purchased clothing and other items
    from R&amp;M for resale in the United Kingdom by a company known as Global
    Sales Limited (“Global”).  Most of the
    goods were sourced by R&amp;M from the respondent, RPM International Trade
    Sales Group, a Division of 1369577 Ontario Inc. (“RPM”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held that R&amp;M breached its
    contract for the sale of goods to Terra Nova and that, subject to proof of <span
class=GramE>damages,</span> RPM would be liable to Terra Nova for negligent
    misrepresentations.  However, the trial
    judge also concluded that the losses arising from these respondents’ wrongful
    conduct were those of Global, rather than Terra Nova.  As a result, Terra Nova had failed to
    establish a claim for any damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also held that Terra Nova’s
    motion, brought during closing submissions at trial, to amend its pleading to
    add Global as a plaintiff in the action would substantially alter the nature of
    the case after the completion of the trial and prejudice the respondents. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, the trial judge denied Terra Nova’s
    joinder motion and dismissed the action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra Nova argues that the trial judge erred:
    (1) by failing to award damages in its favour, (2) by denying judgment to Terra
    Nova on the basis of the failure to include Global in the action as a party
    plaintiff, and (3) by failing to grant judgment in its favour against the
    individual respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We reject these arguments.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s factual findings are fatal to
    Terra Nova’s attack on the trial judgment.  In particular, the trial judge’s finding that the losses in question
    were those of Global, rather than those of Terra Nova, was amply supported by
    the record.  The evidence at trial
    established that Terra Nova purchased the goods in question from R&amp;M and
    then sold the goods to Global, invoicing Global for the sales; the goods were
    inspected in England, warehoused and offered for sale by Global; the bills of
    lading associated with the goods identified Global as consignee; the inventory
    was carried on Global’s financial books of record; and Global incurred the
    transportation and storage costs associated with the goods.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On these facts, which are not challenged before
    this court, we agree with the trial judge that any damages arising from the
    defective merchandise were sustained by Global, not Terra Nova.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although there is overlap in the shareholdings
    in Global and Terra Nova, Global is nonetheless an independent legal entity,
    separate and apart from Terra Nova and Terra Nova’s principal.  As the trial judge observed in her reasons,
    at para. 85:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The fact that [the principal of Terra Nova] may have
    been the source of capital for both companies does not overcome the obstacle
    that the only plaintiff in these proceedings is Terra Nova.  Global’s losses are not Terra Nova’s damages
    simply because the two companies have a common shareholder and source of
    capital.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Terra Nova sold the goods in question to
    Global.  In so doing, Terra Nova
    transferred to Global both the benefits and detriments of the goods originally
    acquired from R&amp;M.  The only
    financial evidence adduced at trial in support of the damages claim related to
    Global.  In all these circumstances,
    Global alone had recourse against the respondents in respect of defects in the
    goods acquired.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor can the trial judge be faulted for denying
    Terra Nova’s joinder motion.  Simply put,
    although Terra Nova had numerous earlier opportunities to seek to join Global
    in the action, it failed to do so until after the close of the evidentiary
    phase of the trial.  It was open to the
    trial judge at that time, in the exercise of her discretion, to refuse to add
    Global as a plaintiff.  Indeed, we agree
    with the trial judge that to permit the requested joinder at that late stage
    would have been unfair and irreparably prejudicial to the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The question of Global’s status as a necessary
    party was a live issue before and throughout the trial.  Terra Nova elected not to seek leave to amend
    its statement of claim to add Global as a plaintiff until after all the
    evidence at trial had been tendered, thus rendering unavailable the usual
    remedies for alleviating prejudice.  It
    made that election at its peril and cannot be heard to now complain of the
    consequences of its decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, we see no basis on which to interfere
    with the trial judge’s finding that an award of damages in Terra Nova’s favour
    could not be made against the individual respondents in their personal
    capacities.  The trial judge’s finding
    that Terra Nova failed to establish that it sustained any damages is dispositive
    of this issue, as it is with respect to Terra Nova’s claims for damages against
    the corporate respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, therefore, while Terra Nova
    succeeded at trial on liability issues, its damages case was fatally flawed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons given, the appeal is
    dismissed.  The respondents are entitled
    to their costs of the appeal, fixed in the total amount of $8,500.</p>
