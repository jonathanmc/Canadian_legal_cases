    appellant, J.A., was convicted of sexual assault and sexual assault with
    a knife following a three-day trial before Justice Timothy A. Culver of the
    Ontario Court of Justice.  Both
    convictions flowed from an alleged confrontation with his wife in their home on
    June 8, 2007.  The appellant was
    sentenced to two years less a day, in addition to 55 days of pre-trial custody
    and probation for three years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant appeals his conviction.  He
    contends that the trial judge improperly relied on the post-event demeanour of
    the complainant as a factor in conviction.  He also submits that the trial judge improperly rejected his evidence at
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    the crucial issue on the appeal relates to the appellants attempt to introduce
    fresh evidence.  During the trial, the
    complainant testified that she bit one of her husbands fingers during his
    prolonged attack on her.  When the police
    interviewed the appellant, on the same day as the incident, they noticed a mark
    on one of his fingers.  In his reasons
    for judgment, the trial judge stated that the complainants evidence was also
    supported by the injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger.  Later he referred to the
    evidence of injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger as
    supportive of the complainants evidence.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant seeks to introduce as fresh evidence the report of Dr. Robert E. Wood,
    a forensic dentist with considerable experience in bite mark analysis.  Based on his examination of the case, Dr.
    Wood has concluded that the mark on the appellants finger was not a bite mark.  The appellant contends that Dr. Woods
    opinion strongly undermines the trial judges reasons and verdict because,
    contrary to the trial judges belief, the injury does not corroborate the
    complainants evidence.  Accordingly, the
    fresh evidence should be admitted, the appeal should be allowed, and an acquittal
    should be entered or, in the alternative, a new trial should be ordered.</span></p>

    appellant and the complainant were married in 1991.  They had two children, a son and a daughter,
    who were 17 and 13 respectively in 2007.  They were having marital difficulties, and there
    had been no sexual relations for about 18 months.  While they formally separated on May 1, 2007,
    the two continued to live together in the family home until they settled their
    affairs, including financial and property matters.  About six months prior to June 2007, the
    appellant began to sleep in a bedroom in the basement.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    complainant testified that after she awakened, she took the dog for a walk,
    prepared lunches for the children, and dressed for work.  After the children left for school, she and
    the appellant engaged in a brief argument about the appellants refusal to
    serve as a chaperone on a school trip involving their daughter.  Shortly after this conversation, the
    appellant grabbed her, carried her forcefully to the basement bedroom, put his
    hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming, held her nose which made
    breathing difficult, and sexually assaulted her.  The complainant described numerous instances
    of actual or attempted sexual intercourse in the basement, including vaginal
    sexual intercourse from the front and from behind and oral sex.  While they were in the basement bedroom, the
    appellant showed her a knife and talked about killing himself.  The appellant then took the complainant
    upstairs to the master bedroom where the sexual assaults continued.</span></p>

    the complainant came to his bedroom in the basement and said that she was
    unsure about their marriage and whether she wanted to separate.  This led to caressing, hugging and kissing,
    and then to sexual relations in various forms and positions.  The appellant testified that he was very
    surprised by what was happening.  The

    from the reality of their almost non-existent sex life in recent years, as
    described by the appellant in his cross-examination:</span></p>

    trial judge delivered comprehensive (27 pages) reasons for judgment.  He carefully reviewed and evaluated the
    testimony of the various witnesses and he articulated and applied the relevant
    legal principles.  He concluded his
    judgment in this fashion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    found the evidence of the complainant compelling, straightforward, credible,
    and supported by her demeanour after she left the house, in her contact with
    her neighbor, and shortly after when her husband attended to retrieve his
    clothing; and as well at the hospital and the Mountain Station when giving her
    initial statements.  Her evidence was
    also supported by the injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger,
    and the general condition of the home when investigated by the police;
    including the location of various items of clothing, and the existence of the
    dull knife.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> evidence was articulate, responsive to the
    questions asked, and generally unshaken in cross-examination.  Taken in isolation, there was little in the
    substance of his evidence, or in the manner in which it was given, that
    suggested it was untrue.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    central issue in the end is one of consent.  I find myself in a similar position to the trial judge in <u>R. v.

    found at (2006) O.J. No. 4749.</span></p>

    beside the complainants evidence, the evidence of the complainants demeanour
    after the attack, the evidence of injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger, their evidence with regard to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> possession of the knife, and their shared knowledge that the knife was dull,
    the manner in which the accused described his interaction with the complainant
    during the event, and the manner in which he described his control of her, all

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    found the evidence of the complainant compelling, straightforward, credible,

    do not accept this submission.  The use
    of evidence relating to the post-event demeanour (perhaps better described as
    post-event emotional state) of a complainant was described by this court in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Varcoe</span></i> (2007), 219 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 33:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>K.F.s
    emotional upset was manifest the day following the assault; it was apparent to
    and noted by her family.  Such evidence
    is admissible and may be used to support a complainants evidence of a sexual
    assault.  See <i>R. v. Boss</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (Ont. C.A.). The weight to be
    given this properly admissible evidence was exclusively a matter for the trial

    light of <span class=SpellE><i>Varcoe</i></span> and <i>Boss</i> (both of which were cited by
    the trial judge in his reasons for judgment), it was clearly permissible for
    the trial judge to admit the evidence relating to the complainants post-event emotional
    state soon after the incident.  Nor, can
    there be any suggestion, in my view, that he gave this evidence too much
    weight.  The key factor in the trial
    judges reasons was his belief in the complainants testimony on the witness
    stand; he called it compelling, straightforward, <span class=GramE>credible</span>.  In support  but only in support  of this
    testimony, the trial judge relied on several other factors, including her
    post-event emotional state in several settings.  This is a question of weight which, as <span class=SpellE><i>Varcoe</i></span> prescribes, is a matter

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The

    the trial judges description of the appellants testimony as articulate,

    ultimate finding that the appellants version of events was not to be believed,
    and does not necessarily suggest that the appellants testimony ought to have
    raised a reasonable doubt.  The trial
    judge reasonably rejected the appellants version of events insofar as the
    complainants consent was concerned because, stacked beside the complainants
    evidence, the evidence of her emotional state following the incident, the
    physical evidence, and the acknowledged state of their marriage and absence of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. ABRAMS: Q. And the evidence you gave with
    respect to the injury you observed on his index finger, you have given your
    opinion as to it being consistent with a tooth mark, but just so were clear I

    marks or bite marks?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Thats correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay.  And
    a dental mark was not retained in any way to look at that bite mark?</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The clear anchor of the trial judges reasons for
    judgment was his belief of the complainants testimony, which he described as
    compelling, straightforward and credible.  In addition, the trial judge identified five other factors that he found
    supported her testimony.  One of those
    factors was the evidence of injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger, presumably caused by the complainants bite during the struggle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the police investigation, photographs were taken
    of the mark on the appellants finger.  At the trial, the photographs were admitted as evidence and the parties
    filed a Statement of Admissions that included this statement: [The
    appellants] finger was injured on one side only.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In preparing for this appeal, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Henein</span> sent the photographs to Dr. Robert E. Wood, a forensic dentist with
    considerable experience in bite mark analysis.  Dr. Wood prepared a report.  His
    conclusion was:  The photographs provide
    enough information...I conclude that these markings are not a bite mark.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to introduce Dr. Woods report as
    fresh evidence.  If it is admitted, the
    appellant requests that the appeal be allowed and an acquittal entered or, in
    the alternative, a new trial ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for the admissibility of fresh evidence was
    established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, and encompasses four
    propositions: the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
    diligence, it could have been adduced at trial; the evidence must be relevant
    in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the
    trial; the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable
    of belief; and it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken
    with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the
    result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the second and third of these
    criteria  relevance and evidence reasonably capable of belief  are present in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant essentially concedes that he cannot meet
    the due diligence criterion.  This is a
    fair concession as trial counsel was well aware of the potential linkage
    between the mark on the appellants finger and the possible value of expert
    evidence to explain the nature of the mark.  Trial counsel cross-examined Det. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span> about his own expertise in this area and, in an affidavit prepared for the
    fresh evidence application, indicated that he had considered and rejected the
    possibility of retaining an expert to analyze the mark.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the
    appellants position on the due diligence criterion is put no higher than it
    should not be determinative, or that it cannot trump the other <i>Palmer</i> criteria.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not disagree with the appellants invocation of
    caution concerning the due diligence criterion.  However, I pause to make two observations.  First, as stated above, the appellant cannot
    meet this criterion in this case.  Second, the due diligence criterion is part of the <i>Palmer</i> test and cannot be ignored or wished away.  It plays an important role in the
    administration of criminal justice, as explained by Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. M.(P.S.)</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d)
    402 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 411:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The interests of justice referred to in s. 683 of
    the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> encompass not only an <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> interest in having his or her guilt determined upon all of the available evidence
    but also the integrity of the criminal process.  Finality and order are essential to that integrity.  The criminal justice system is arranged so
    that the trial will provide the opportunity to the parties to present their
    respective cases and the appeal will provide the opportunity to challenge the
    correctness of what happened at the trial.  Section 683(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) of the <i>Code</i> recognizes that the appellate function can be expanded in
    exceptional cases, but it cannot be that the appellate process should be used
    routinely to augment the trial record.  Were it otherwise, the finality of the trial process would be lost and
    cases would be retried on appeal whenever more evidence was secured by a party
    prior to the hearing of the appeal.  For
    this reason, the exceptional nature of the admission of fresh evidence on
    appeal has been stressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That leaves the fourth criterion, namely, would Dr.
    Woods evidence that the mark on the appellants finger was not a bite mark, if
    believed, be expected to have affected the result?  In my view, the answer to this question must
    be no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point in this stage of the analysis is
    that the trial judge relied on the supposed bite mark on the appellants finger
    as evidence that supported his conclusion that the complainant was credible.  It is important to note that the trial
    judges finding about the complainants credibility was a particularly strong
    one  he described her testimony as compelling, straightforward and
    credible.  Moreover, he reached this
    conclusion after a comprehensive review of the complainants testimony and
    without the aid of any supporting evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to the other evidence and
    listed five factors that in his view supported his conclusion that the
    complainant was a credible witness: the complainants post-offence demeanour;
    the injury to the appellants finger; the general condition of the home when
    investigated by the police, including the location of various items of clothing
    that was consistent with the complainants evidence; the existence of the dull
    knife; and the general internal and external logic and consistency of her
    description of the events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, two of these factors were particularly
    powerful.  The evidence of the
    complainants neighbour, and of Det. Walters and Det. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span>,
    about the complainants physical and emotional state in the minutes and hours
    after the event was, in my view, strong evidence indeed.  The same can be said about the logic of the
    complainants testimony.  On June 8,
    2007, the parties were separated.  The
    appellant had moved to the basement bedroom six months earlier.  There had been no sexual relations for 18
    months as the complainant had  on the appellants own testimony  virtually no
    interest in sex.  The complainant was
    dressed for work, she was expected at work where several people reported to
    her, and the parties had just argued about their daughters school trip.  The constellation of these contextual facts
    lends substantial credence to the complainants compelling, straightforward,
    credible testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I am of the view that Dr. Woods
    evidence, even if believed, could not reasonably be expected to have affected
    the result.  The other evidence adduced
    at trial still compels the convictions entered by the trial judge.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the application
    to admit the fresh evidence in the form of Dr. Woods report.</p>

    also lived in the home.  The appellant

    for 18 months or more.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They lived in a detached bungalow with a main floor and

      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    went to a

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    would have
    to pay the appellant an equalization payment of approximately $70,000 upon the
    dissolution of their marriage.  There
    were further discussions between them with respect to options for dealing with
    the equalization payment, one of which was for the appellant to buy from

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    her

    requiring her to make arrangements to live elsewhere.  As of June 8, 2007, S.A. had met with a real

    May 1, 2007.  There had been brief
    indications by S.A. that she was considering reconciliation, but these were very
    short-lived, and just prior to June 8, 2007, it was clear that S.A. was intent

    described the appellant
    physically forcing her into his bedroom, and later her bedroom, where he forced
    her to engage in many acts of vaginal and oral sexual intercourse despite her
    very explicit and physical protestations.  S.A. testified that during this period she was afraid for her safety
    because the appellant physically overpowered her and at times handled a knife,
    threatened suicide, and threatened at one point to kill her.  The appellant, on the other hand, described
    the events as beginning quite spontaneously when
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    had followed him to his

    separation; that they hugged, then kissed, and then engaged in several acts of
    consensual vaginal and oral sexual intercourse first in his bedroom and later
    in her bedroom.</p>

  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.A. testified that she was about to leave for work
    when the appellant grabbed her from behind, lifted her off the ground, and was
    carrying her down the stairs when she screamed.  She testified that, while still carrying her, the appellant then placed
    his right hand over her mouth.  In so
    doing, he also blocked her nose and she had difficulty breathing.  She testified that she bit his finger.  She indicated that, I believe it was his
    middle finger. I bit it very hard.  In
    cross-examination she indicated, I bit him as hard as I could.  On the other hand, the appellant testified
    that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    followed him down to his bedroom, about ten to fifteen seconds after he had
    left her upstairs to go down and get dressed. The appellant explicitly denied
    he was ever bitten by S.A.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was arrested by the police later the same
    day.  Detective Constable (D.C.) <span
class=SpellE>Hennick</span> interviewed the appellant.  D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span> was
    aware, prior to conducting the interview, <span class=GramE>of  S.A</span>.s allegations that she had bitten
    the appellants hand.  He testified that
    during this interview, he couldnt help but notice that he had what looked
    like a fresh mark or bite mark on his hand.  He continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I noted that it appeared to be fresh but that it
    wasnt bleeding, and that to me it appeared consistent with a tooth mark
    because it went around the same width as a tooth mark, the first  the mark
    that I could see the clearest.  I guess
    it would be about two or two and a half or one-eighth of a diameter, so about
    three-eighths of a width long.  Thats
    how wide the tooth mark looked that was on his finger, and it looked like there
    was a thin layer of skin that was over top of that cut.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I found  what I thought was also interesting is
    the way [S.A.] described how the accused would have put her  or put his hand
    over her mouth; that tooth mark, if it was that, that would have been from the
    underside of her teeth biting up against the inside of his hand.  So thats what it looked like to me.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During cross-examination of D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span>,
    the following question was asked and answered:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    the evidence you gave with respect to the injury you observed on his index
    finger, you have given your opinion as to it being consistent with a tooth
    mark, but just so were clear I take it thats your lay opinion; you have no
    particular expertise in dental marks or bite marks?</p>

    appellants finger was injured on one side only.  During his testimony, the appellant had no
    recollection of receiving the injury to his finger, and indicated that he first
    noticed it when he was interviewed by D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span>.
    The police took photographs of this injury and two photographs of it were

    answer.  She then drove to her friends
    house.  At her friends house, her
    friends husband opened the door and S.A. testified that she started to cry and
    said, I think we need to call the police.  He got his wife, D.M., to come to the door. 
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

    was threatening to kill himself.  S.A.
    indicated that she said they should call an ambulance, but D.M. said they
    should call the police, and then S.A. asked if they could call the appellants

  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.M. testified that when she first saw

    wringing her hands, visibly upset, at times crying, and having difficulty
    recalling the incident in chronological order.  The interview was interrupted, and the statement continued later that
    evening at the police station.  At that
    time, Officer Walters testified that S.A. was very upset where I was having
    problems getting  eliciting details in the chronological order of events;
    visibly shaken, very distraught. Officer Walters was also at the house two
    days later on June 10 when the appellant arrived with a police escort to obtain
    some of his personal belongings.  When

    that she was sitting in with both of her arms, both of her hands, sorry, and
    looked down at her lap. It sounded like she was whimpering. I noticed that she
    immediately had begun to cry and that her eyes opened up  her eyes were
    filling with tears but tears werent actually coming down her face they were
    just staying in the lower  lower lid I guess. She began to shake. It was

    extensively reviewed the testimony of all of the witnesses in the trial.  After reviewing the complainants testimony
    in-chief and in cross-examination, the trial judge indicated that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The complainant] generally confirmed her evidence
    in-chief during her cross-examination, and gave a frank and honest account of
    events, without hyperbole.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I found her to be a straightforward, credible

    inconsequential. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;

    the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I found the evidence of the complainant compelling,
    straightforward, credible, and supported by her demeanour after she left the
    house, in her contact with her neighbour, and shortly after when her husband
    attended to retrieve his clothing; and as well at the hospital and the [police
    station] when giving her initial statements. Her evidence was also supported by
    the injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger, and the general

    of various items of clothing, and the existence of the dull knife.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> evidence
    was articulate, responsive to the questions asked, and generally unshaken in
    cross-examination. Taken in isolation, there was little in the substance of his
    evidence, or in the manner in which it was given, that suggested it was untrue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The central issue in the end is one of consent. I
    find myself in a similar position to the trial judge in <i>R. v. J.J.R.D.</i>, a decision of the Court of Appeal released November

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Stacked beside the complainants evidence, the
    evidence of the complainants demeanour after the attack, the evidence of
    injury to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> finger, their evidence with
    regard to the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> possession of the knife, and
    their shared knowledge that the knife was dull, the manner in which the accused
    described his interaction with the complainant during the event, and the manner
    in which he described his control of her, all of which I find supportive of the
    complainants evidence, and the general internal and external logic and consistency
    of the complainants description of events, as opposed to the <span
class=SpellE>accuseds</span> evidence as outlined in the Crowns submissions,
    I find the <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> evidence is not capable of
    belief.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Considering all of the evidence, I am satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence of sexual

'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant brought an application pursuant to
    section 683(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to adduce fresh evidence in this appeal.  The fresh evidence consists essentially of a forensic <span
class=SpellE>odontology</span> bite mark report prepared by Dr. Robert Wood
    with respect to the scenario and photographs of the injury to the appellants
    finger in this case. Accompanying that report is the extensive <i>curriculum vitae</i> of Dr. Wood, and a
    transcript of the examination and cross-examination of Dr. Wood with respect to
    that report.  Also submitted, as part of
    this application, is an affidavit of the appellants trial counsel indicating
    the reason for not obtaining such expert evidence for trial.  Finally, attached to this application is a
    letter from counsel for the Crown, confirming that the Crown withdrew their
    intention to file an experts report in response to the report of Dr. Wood on
    the application.  This withdrawal
    apparently occurred after the Crowns expert was subjected to cross-examination
    by counsel for the appellant.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In substance, Dr. Woods opinion, as expressed in his
    report, is that the injury depicted in the photographs of the appellants
    finger is not a bite mark.  Dr. Wood was
    also asked to consider whether the absence of a corresponding tooth mark on the
    opposite side of the appellants finger was significant or relevant.  Dr. Wood indicated that it is highly unlikely
    to have a marking on one side of a bitten finger without a corresponding
    opposing mark on the opposite side of the finger.  In his report, and under cross-examination,
    Dr. Wood also explained the features that are not present in the photographs
    that he would expect to be present had this mark been caused by a human bite,
    such as described by S.A.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The affidavit of the appellants trial counsel makes it
    clear that: (1) he was aware that the Crown might suggest that the injury
    corresponded to the bite S.A. claimed to have inflicted; (2) he did not consult
    with an expert because (a) the Crown had not disclosed that they had consulted
    or were calling an expert, (b) simply from looking at the picture one could
    conclude the mark was merely a generic scratch and (c) the police officers
    opinion was of no value and would be inadmissible; and (3) he believed because
    there was no corresponding mark on the other side of the finger, the injury
    could not be a bite mark, and the evidence would support the appellants
    position at trial that he had not been bitten. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal
    was addressed in <i>R. v. Truscott</i> (2007), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    ), at p. 351:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The admissibility of this kind of evidence on
    appeal is tested against the criteria articulated by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>R. v. Palmer and Palmer</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193.  Those criteria are well known.  They encompass three components:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Is the evidence admissible under the operative
    rules of evidence?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Is the evidence sufficiently cogent in that it
    could reasonably be expected to have affected the verdict?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What is the explanation offered for the failure
    to adduce the evidence at trial and should that explanation affect the
    admissibility of the evidence?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The first two of these components are directed at
    preconditions to the admissibility of <i>Palmer</i> evidence under s.
    683(1).  Evidence that is not admissible
    under the usual rules of evidence governing criminal proceedings, or is not
    sufficiently cogent to potentially affect the verdict, cannot be admitted on
    appeal.  The last component, sometimes
    referred to as the due diligence requirement, is not a precondition to
    admissibility.  It becomes important only
    if the proffered evidence meets the first two preconditions to
    admissibility.  The explanation offered
    for the failure to adduce evidence at trial, or in some cases the absence of
    any explanation, can result in the exclusion of evidence that would otherwise
    be admissible on appeal.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent conceded that the evidence was relevant
    and reasonably capable of belief.  The
    respondent argued that the appellant could have adduced the evidence at trial,
    and further, even if the expert evidence on bite marks had been led and
    believed, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, it would not
    have affected the result.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find that the evidence is relevant and credible, and
    otherwise admissible under the operative rules of evidence. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the significance of the alleged bite
    relates to the central issue of whether or not there was consent. 
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    testified that the biting
    occurred in the course of her initial resistance to the conduct of the
    appellant.  Accordingly, it was advanced
    as tangible evidence of her resistance and the corresponding absence of consent.  Indeed, that is how the trial judge construed
    the evidence in that he appears to have used it as corroborative of S.A.s
    version of events and, therefore, supportive of her credibility.  In reaching that conclusion, he had to, of
    necessity, rely upon D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennicks</span> opinion that the
    injury was a bite mark, or at least an injury caused by the alleged bite.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fresh expert evidence proffered, on the other hand,
    completely contradicts the evidence at trial that the injury was caused by a
    human bite.  Based on the trial judges
    reasons, it is apparent that conflicting expert evidence on the bite mark could
    have had an impact on the result.  He
    found the complainants testimony credible, but that he also found the
    appellants testimony  standing on its own  credible.  In his analysis, the trial judge, as is
    evident from his reasons, turned to other independent evidence to assist in
    resolving this conflict in favour of the complainant.  The trial judge clearly relied on the injury
    as supporting
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    s
    credibility.  Indeed, he twice referred
    to it prominently in drawing critical conclusions. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the evidence of the complainant, the expert
    concludes that the bite mark allegedly inflicted would have certain
    characteristics, including swelling and reddening, subcutaneous bruising, multiple
    teeth marks, and an opposing bite mark on the other side of the finger.  Since these features were absent with respect
    to the injury of the appellant, in consideration of the expert evidence, the
    trial judge may have concluded that the appellant was not bitten, which at a
    minimum, would have left the trial judge without one significant piece of
    corroborating evidence for his finding in favour of the complainant.  In the circumstances, in a trial that
    essentially came down to a credibility contest, it cannot be said that the
    fresh evidence of the expert could not have had an impact on the conclusion he
    reached.  </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I find that in this particular case
    the fresh evidence is sufficiently cogent, in that it could reasonably be
    expected to have affected the verdict. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn then to the last element of the test regarding
    fresh evidence applications.  I accept
    trial counsels unchallenged explanation for why such expert evidence was not
    obtained to tender at trial.  The
    question remains, however, whether that explanation should affect the
    admissibility of the evidence.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Warsing</span></i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    51, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is desirable that due diligence remain only one
    factor and its absence, particularly in criminal cases, should be assessed in
    light of other circumstances. If the evidence is compelling and the interests
    of justice require that it be admitted then the failure to meet the test should
    yield to permit its admission.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The due diligence requirement serves an important
    purpose.  As a matter of policy, there
    are sound and compelling reasons to ensure available evidence is advanced at
    trial so that fresh evidence applications do not become a routine part of every
    appeal.  However, the importance of the
    due diligence issue will vary from case to case, and it should be evaluated in
    the totality of the circumstances of each case.  The inability to satisfy the due diligence criterion must yield where
    its rigid application might lead to a miscarriage of justice:  see <i>R.
    v. G.D.B.,</i> [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that this is the situation in the
    present case.  Here, the fresh evidence
    is sufficiently cogent that it could reasonably be expected to have affected
    the verdict, and thus calls into question the reliability of the verdict.  Under these circumstances, I find that
    regardless of whether the explanation of trial counsel could be construed as a
    lack of due diligence, the evidence here is of sufficient importance so as to warrant
    its admission.  Any other result could
    lead to a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I have found the fresh expert evidence credible,
    in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief for the purposes of the
    fresh evidence application, it is my view that the weight it ought to be given
    is ultimately a question for a <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact, after
    cross-examination and in the context of the other evidence that may be adduced
    at trial. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would grant the application to introduce
    the fresh evidence on this appeal.  Further, in consideration of this fresh evidence, I would grant the
    appeal and order a new trial.  </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have found that the fresh evidence is reasonably
    capable of affecting the verdict under appeal.  However, in my view, the reasons of the trial judge reveal errors of law
    that lead me to conclude that a new trial should be ordered, regardless of the
    fresh evidence. </p>

  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I return to the evidence regarding the bite mark.  The trial judge accepted the evidence of D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span> that the injury to the appellants finger was
    a bite or tooth mark.  When reviewing the
    D.C.s testimony, the trial judge stated that, He testified that the cut
    appeared consistent with a tooth mark.  The trial judge then relied on this evidence as a basis for preferring
    the evidence of S.A. to that of the appellant.  The issue of the admissibility of this evidence was raised for the first
    time on appeal. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents factum addressed the issue as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge reasonably relied on the evidence
    relating to the injury to the Appellants finger. The evidence relating to the
    injury is not automatically deemed inadmissible simply because no expert
    evidence was called to confirm that the injury was in fact a bite mark.  The complainant testified that she bit the
    Appellant.  She admitted she could not be
    certain which finger she bit given that she did not see the Appellants finger
    at the time.  Officer <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span> corroborated the complainants evidence insofar as he observed an injury to the
    Appellants finger.  The Appellant could
    not offer any explanation for the injury to his finger. The trial judge did not
    misapprehend the evidence relating to the finger and was permitted to rely on
    such evidence and give it as much weight as he felt it deserved.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> One telling
    comment about the bite mark evidence is set out in the reasons of the trial
    judge, in response to the submissions of defence counsel.  The trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence further submits that the bite mark on
    the complainants finger could be a bite mark, but could also be many other
    things.  The defence submits that, had
    the accused been bitten on his hand as hard as alleged by the <span
class=GramE>complainant,</span> there should have been a bite mark on the other
    side of his finger.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>That is unsupported speculation, in my view.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only evidence that the trial judge had before him
    regarding the injury was the photographs and the evidence of D.C. <span
class=SpellE>Hennick</span>.  It was on
    this basis that he rejected the submissions of defence counsel as being
    unsupported speculation.  He did not
    refer to his own views on the photograph, referencing instead the testimony of
    D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennick</span>. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admissibility of the opinion that the injury to the
    appellants finger was consistent with a tooth or bite mark is governed by the
    opinion rule.  It is a fundamental rule
    of evidence that opinions are generally inadmissible.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. K. (A) </i>(1999),

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 71, this court reiterated the opinion rule
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The opinion rule is a general rule of exclusion.
    Witnesses testify as to facts. As a general rule, they are not allowed to give
    any opinion about those facts. Opinion evidence is generally inadmissible.
    Opinion evidence is generally excluded because it is a fundamental principle of
    our system of justice that it is up to the <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of
    fact to draw inferences from the evidence and to form his or her opinions on
    the issues in the case.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are exceptions to the opinion rule.  The most common exception to the opinion rule
    is an opinion of a properly qualified expert:  see <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2
    S.C.R. 9.   Another exception is when lay
    witnesses are permitted to express their opinion where they are merely giving
    a compendious statement of facts in the form of an opinion, as held in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Graat</span></i>,
    [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Graat</i></span>, the Supreme Court of Canada made reference to a
    number of common subjects about which lay witnesses can express admissible
    opinions, including: the identification of handwriting, persons and things;
    apparent age; the bodily plight or condition of a person, including death and
    illness; the emotional state of a person; intoxication; the condition of
    things, e.g. worn, shabby, used or new; certain questions of value; and
    estimates of speed and distance. The reasoning in essence is that these are not
    matters where scientific, <span class=GramE>technical,</span> or specialized
    testimony is necessary in order that the tribunal properly understands the
    relevant facts (at p. 838).</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, in <i>Mohan </i>the Supreme Court, in setting out the factors for the
    admissibility of expert evidence, said in relation to the necessity of expert
    evidence, at <br>
    p. 23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This pre-condition is often expressed in terms as
    to whether the evidence would be helpful to the <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact.  The word &quot;helpful&quot; is
    not quite appropriate and sets too low a standard.  However, I would not judge necessity by too
    strict a standard.  What is required is
    that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information
    &quot;which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or
    jury&quot;: as quoted by Dickson J. in <i>R.
    v. Abbey</i>, [[1982] 2 S.C.R. 24]. As stated by Dickson J., the evidence must
    be necessary to enable the <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact to
    appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Kelliher</i></span><i> (Village of)
    v. Smith</i>, [1931] S.C.R. 672, at p. 684, this Court, quoting from <span
class=SpellE>Beven</span> on Negligence (4th ed. 1928), at p. 141, stated that
    in order for expert evidence to be admissible, &quot;[t]he subject-matter of
    the inquiry must be such that ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct
    judgment about it, if unassisted by persons with special knowledge&quot;.  More recently, in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Lavallee</span></i>, [[1990] 1 S.C.R. 852],
    the above passages from <span class=SpellE><i>Kelliher</i></span> and <i>Abbey</i> were applied to admit
    expert evidence as to the state of mind of a &quot;battered&quot; woman.  The judgment stressed that this was an area
    that is not understood by the average person.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both of these cases set out the conditions under which
    opinion evidence could be admitted, rather than directing whether expert
    evidence is required.  However, the broad
    principles, and examples, serve to provide guidelines as to when opinion
    evidence, if it is to be admitted, ought to be provided by an expert rather
    than a lay person.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From past cases, it appears that evidence relating to
    bite marks has generally been elicited through experts:  see <i>R.
    v. Ho</i> (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 270 (Ont. C.A); <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Hibbert</span></i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445; and <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Taillefer</span>;</i> <i>R. v <span class=SpellE>Duguay</span></i>,
    [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307.   In a recent case
    where the bite mark evidence was apparently elicited through non-expert witnesses,
    that the underlying injury was a bite mark does not appear to have been in
    question:  see <i>R. v. French</i>,<i> </i>2009 ONCA
    787. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, D.C. <span class=SpellE>Hennicks</span> testimony to the presence of an injury on the appellants hand was
    admissible.  It was factual and based on <span
class=GramE>his own</span> observation.  The cause of the injury, or what that injury may have appeared to be
    consistent with, required him to verge into speculation or, alternatively, into
    a field in which he admittedly had no special expertise or qualifications.  In the circumstances, his opinion was not
    admissible and ought not to have been admitted into evidence. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am mindful that there was not an explicit objection

    stated in <span class=SpellE><i>Graat</i></span>,<i> </i>at p. 823,  I do not think failure on the part of
    defence counsel to object to the admission of inadmissible evidence should, in

'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another area where the trial judge fell into reversible
    error was in his treatment of the demeanour evidence.  In this case there were three separate
    segments of evidence relating to the post-incident demeanour of the complainant:
    (1) immediately after the incident at her friends house; (2) later that day
    when giving a statement to the police, which began at the hospital and
    continued at the police station; and (3) two days later at her house when the
    appellant was escorted to the house by the police to obtain some of his
    personal belongings.  I note that the
    trial counsel objected to the third segment of this evidence, prior to its
    introduction. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to demeanour evidence, the trial judge
    made reference to <i>R. v <span
class=SpellE>Varcoe</span></i> (2007), 219 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  <span class=SpellE><i>Varcoe</i></span> followed <i>R. v.
    Boss</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), which, in turn, followed <i>R. v.</i> <i>Murphy, </i>[1977] 2 S.C.R. 603. The trial judge relied on this line of
    cases in support of the proposition that evidence of the complainants
    demeanour is admissible in sexual assault cases.  In <i>R.
    v. Lindsay</i>, 2005 <span class=SpellE>CanLII</span> 24240 (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ont.
    S.C.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 159, <span class=SpellE>Fuerst</span> J. summarized the relevant considerations underlying this proposition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree that it can be dangerous to place weight on
    a witnesss demeanour when he or she testifies.&nbsp; It is well-<span
class=GramE>established,</span> however, that evidence of a complainants
    emotional state after an alleged offence may constitute circumstantial evidence
    confirming that the offence occurred, depending on the circumstances of the
    case, including the temporal nexus to the alleged offence and the existence of
    alternative explanations for the emotional state.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not satisfied by the trial judges reasons that he
    adequately directed himself on this issue, in particular relating to the
    existence of alternative explanations for the emotional state of the
    complainant. Where there are alternative explanations, some <span class=SpellE>inculpatory</span> and some not, and the precise explanation is not identified, the demeanour
    evidence is ambiguous.  Such evidence is
    not relevant and should not be admitted without a proper foundation being
    established for its admissibility. Ambiguous demeanour evidence can be highly
    prejudicial and is of no probative value. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there are a multitude of possible reasons
    for the emotional state of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      S.A.</st1:country-region>
    arising out of the circumstances of the family dispute which are consistent
    with her behaviour on other occasions.  In <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Morelli</span></i> (2010), 316 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 (S.C.C.), <br>
    Fish J., writing for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, referred, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 91, to drawing an inference in such circumstances as
    to speculate impermissibly.  The
    reasoning of the trial judge that the demeanour of the complainant supported
    her credibility, to the ultimate effect that the evidence of the appellant was
    rejected, failed to take these considerations into account.  The effect of this was that he improperly
    admitted this circumstantial evidence which was not relevant, thus committing
    an error of law. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third element of demeanour evidence, to which
    defence counsel raised an objection at trial, highlights the point.  Both police officers testified that they were
    with the complainant when the appellant was being escorted to the family home
    to retrieve his belongings.  When this line
    of questioning was put to the first officer called to testify, defence counsel
    objected that this evidence had not previously been led through the complainant
    in her examination-in-chief.  The trial
    judge overruled the objection. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The substance of the evidence given by the police
    officers was that the complainant became very distressed and upset when she saw
    the appellant being escorted into their home.  However, neither officer apparently asked the complainant about the
    reasons why she had become upset.  The
    trial judge inferred, improperly in my view<span class=GramE>,  that</span> the emotional state was caused by
    the alleged sexual assault, without considering any other possible reason.  His reliance on this demeanour evidence to
    support his credibility finding represents circular reasoning.  As Doherty J.A. stated in <i>R. v. Portillo</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d)
    467 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 37, in commenting on such circular
    reasoning, on close analysis, that reasoning goes beyond inference to
    assumption and speculation. The only way such an inference can be drawn, to
    the exclusion of other possibilities, is if it is assumed <i>a priori </i>that the offence has taken place.  In the absence of the offence, there would be
    no foundation for the inference.  </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><i>The
    Evidentiary Analysis</i></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons for judgment of the trial judge paint two
    conflicting views of the evidence of the appellant.  First, he states that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <span class=SpellE>accuseds</span> evidence
    was articulate, responsive to the questions asked, and generally unshaken in
    cross-examination.  Taken in isolation,
    there was little in the substance of his evidence, or in the manner in which it
    was given, that suggested it was untrue.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'>However, the trial judge ultimately
    rejected the evidence of the accused as not capable of belief, based on
    weighing it against the evidence of the complainant, the demeanour evidence and
    the bite mark evidence, among other things. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he purported to apply the <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> analysis, in my view, the manner in
    which the trial judge conducted his analysis is more in keeping with the civil
    test of reaching a result on the preponderance of the evidence rather than
    determining whether the evidence established the guilt of the appellant beyond
    a reasonable doubt.  It appears from the
    language he used that he found the testimony of the complainant and the
    appellant relatively <span class=GramE>credible,</span> but that other evidence
    in the case favoured the complainant and not the appellant and therefore he
    found the evidence of the appellant not capable of belief.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with this construction is that it
    appears that the trial judge simply weighed the testimony of the complainant
    against the testimony of the appellant, <span class=GramE>then,</span> having
    added factors to the complainants testimony, found they tilted the balance in
    her favour.  Unfortunately, that
    construction does not include the second step in the <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> analysis  whether, even if you do
    not believe the evidence of the accused, it raises a reasonable doubt.  In neglecting to address this question, the
    trial judge fell into error.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the fresh evidence application.  For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the
    appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial. </p>
