  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it was open to the trial judge to find that the respondent
    acted on the sudden and in using the term “provocation”, he meant nothing more
    than that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are, however, of the view that the global sentence of seven years
    which he imposed for the offences of attempted murder, threatening death and
    breach of probation was manifestly unfit in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, we note that the respondent had engaged in a history of
    violence towards the complainant and that he had two prior convictions for
    domestic assault – the last one, which involved the same complainant, having
    occurred five months earlier. The respondent was on probation at the time of
    the instant offences and he breached the condition which required him not to be
    in the complainant’s presence within 24 hours of having consumed alcohol. No
    doubt, his breach of that condition precipitated the horrendous attack that he
    carried on the complainant. That attack was vicious, and resulted in the
    complainant being stabbed numerous times. But for prompt medical intervention,
    the complainant would have died from her injuries. To this date, the respondent
    does not accept responsibility for his conduct and continues to maintain that
    the injuries to the complainant were caused by accident. His inability or
    unwillingness to accept the gravity and seriousness of his conduct renders him
    a continuing danger to society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, a sentence of eight and a half years for the
    offence of attempted murder is the lowest sentence that in our view, could be
    considered fit. The breach of probation charge, for which the respondent
    received a six month concurrent sentence, was in our view, a separate and
    distinct crime that called for a consecutive sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, we would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and
    increase the sentence on the charge of attempted murder to eight and a half
    years, less the time that the trial judge gave (just under four years) for time
    served in pre-trial custody. The sentence on the charge of threatening death
    shall remain at one year concurrent. The sentence of six months for breach of
    probation is made consecutive to the other sentences. For clarity, the global
    sentence has been increased from 3 years to 5 years in addition to time served.
    In all other respect, the sentence imposed by the trial judge should remain the
    same.</p>
