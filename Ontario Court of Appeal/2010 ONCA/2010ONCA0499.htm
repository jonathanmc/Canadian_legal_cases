  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.         Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This litigation arose from a dispute between the appellants, the
    promoters of a limited partnership tax shelter known as the Jasper Avenue
    Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”), and the respondents, a group of
    investors in the Partnership.  The business of the Partnership involved the
    ownership and management of a twin tower condominium complex located on Jasper
    Avenue, in Edmonton, Alberta (the “Property”).  Investment units in the
    Partnership were offered for sale to members of the public by means of an
    offering memorandum dated June 30, 1989 (the “OM”), issued pursuant to the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 466 (the “Act”).  The dispute centred on certain of
    the rights and obligations created by the OM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, the principal issue concerns the respondents’ alleged
    obligation to pay certain loans made by the appellants in respect of the financing
    of the Partnership.  The appellants maintain that the OM and associated
    Partnership subscription documents obliged the respondents, as investors and
    limited partners in the Partnership, to repay the loans in question on or
    before August 31, 1994.  They appeal from the trial judge’s ruling that the
    respondents are not contractually obliged to pay the loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, in turn, allege that they sustained damages as a result
    of misrepresentations by the appellants in the OM concerning the value of the
    Partnership investment.  They rely on the deemed reliance component of a
    contractual rights clause in the OM to support their misrepresentations claim. 
    They cross-appeal from the trial judge’s ruling regarding the scope of the
    contractual rights clause and from her rejection of their misrepresentations
    claim.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many of the background facts are not in dispute and were incorporated in
    a lengthy agreed statement of facts filed by the parties at trial.  The
    following facts are relevant to the disposition of this proceeding.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Acquisition of the Property</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Property was originally operated as a rental apartment project,
    although it had been converted to condominium status by 1983.  In 1984, the
    appellant Roycom Entrepreneurs Real Estate Fund Limited Partnership (the
    “Fund”) and S. L. Sussex Leaseholds Limited (“Sussex”), a predecessor in
    interest to the appellant Skye Properties Limited (“Skye”), purchased the
    Property for approximately $10 million.  They intended to renovate and to
    reduce rental vacancies in the Property, to raise rents to achieve acceptable
    operating cash flows and, by 1987, to begin selling condominium units in the
    project.  The Fund had a 51% interest in the Property, while Sussex had a 49%
    interest.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Limited
    Partnership Agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In mid-1987, the Fund and Sussex decided to sell the Property.  Over the
    next several months, their efforts to dispose of the Property as an apartment
    building proved unsuccessful, although various offers to purchase were received
    and rejected.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the fall of 1987, a significant stock market crash had occurred,
    leading to a consequential downturn in the real estate market.  Nonetheless, throughout
    1988, the appellants continued to explore the sale of the Property under
    various scenarios, one of which involved the potential syndicated conversion of
    the Property from a rental project in order to sell individual condominium
    units in the Property.  To this end, appraisals and valuation opinions
    pertaining to the Property were obtained.  Also in 1988, Sussex transferred its
    interest in the Property to Skye, a related corporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the Fund and Skye decided to sell the Property to the public
    as a limited partnership.  By June 30, 1989, a limited partnership agreement
    (the “LPA”) had been entered into and the Partnership was formed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The LPA described the business of the Partnership in these terms: “to
    participate in the real estate rental business by acquiring, owning, leasing,
    managing and operating the Property and to conduct such other activities as may
    be necessary or incidental to the foregoing”: s. 2.03, LPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 3.03 of the LPA, the Partnership’s General Partner, the
    appellant Jasper Avenue G.P. Inc. (the “General Partner”), was authorized to
    raise capital for the Partnership by offering and selling 122 limited
    partnership units to members of the public at the subscription price set out in
    the OM and by admitting the purchasers of such units as limited partners of the
    Partnership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the LPA, the General Partner was granted “exclusive authority to
    manage, control, administer and operate the business and affairs of the
    Partnership and, subject to the provisions of [the LPA], to make all decisions
    regarding the business of the Partnership”: s. 6.01, LPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Correspondingly, the LPA precluded the investors, as limited partners,
    from taking part in the control of the Partnership business, transacting any
    business for the Partnership, and acting for or binding the Partnership.  With
    the exception of certain specific transactions that are inapplicable in this
    case, all such powers were “vested solely and exclusively” in the General
    Partner: s. 4.01, LPA.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Offering
    Memorandum</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM was issued under a prospectus-exemption provision of the Act. 
    Several other marketing documents were utilized by the appellants to attract
    investors in the Partnership, including a “Glossy Brochure”, “green sheets”
    that described the highlights of the investment, and “question and answer
    sheets”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM stated that the Partnership had been formed “to acquire, own and
    operate 2 residential towers comprised of 284 residential condominium suites
    and 4 commercial condominiums” situated on Jasper Avenue, in Edmonton.  The
    purpose of the offering was described in the OM in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The purpose of the offering is to provide investors
    in Units with:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>capital appreciation potential, which, if and when realized, may qualify
    as a tax free capital gain;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an escalating annual cash flow; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the ability to use available provisions of the <i>Tax Act</i> permitting
    tax deferral and deductions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the OM, 122 limited partnership units were offered for sale at a
    subscription price ranging from $154,944 to $188,108 per unit, depending on the
    particular condominium units to which each limited partnership was referenced,
    for a total offering price of $19.7 million.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the terms of the OM, the subscription price for each unit
    was to be paid through a combination of a cash deposit in the amount of $1,000
    and various loans, as follows: (1) an “equity loan” for 27% of the subscription
    price; (2) a “first secured loan” for 53.3% (between $82,563 and $100,327) of
    the subscription price (the “First Loans”); and (3) the “second secured loan”
    for 19.2% (between $29,683 and $36,105) (the “Second Loans”), of the
    subscription price per unit.  Each of these financing loans was paid by three
    promissory notes signed by the General Partner on behalf of investors in
    respect of each unit purchased, as I later describe.  Of these loans, only
    payment of the Second Loans is at issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the Second Loans, the Fund and Skye – acting through the
    General Partner – also provided cash flow loans to fund any Partnership cash
    flow deficiencies and to cover payments on the First Loans, up to a cumulative
    maximum amount of $2 million (the “Cash Flow Loans”).  Liability for payment of
    the Cash Flow Loans is also at issue in this proceeding.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(i)</span></i><i><span lang=EN-US>        Subscription Form</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM included a subscription form (the “Subscription Form”), which each
    investor was required to sign in order to purchase a Partnership unit.  The
    Subscription Form contained a power of attorney in favour of the General
    Partner, an equity note, a first secured note, a second secured note and a
    direction concerning the financing loans to which the notes were referenced.  Under
    the Subscription Form, the investor represented that he or she had read and
    understood the OM before subscribing for a Partnership unit and, further, that
    he or she was “aware of the characteristics” of the units subscribed for and
    their “speculative nature”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, the Subscription Form also expressly provided that the
    investor subscribed for the unit(s) of the Partnership “<i>on the terms and as
    described in the [OM]</i>”<i> </i>(emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the power of attorney contained in the Subscription Form,
    the subscribing investor authorized the General Partner to execute and deliver
    “all documents relating to [the investor’s] Equity Loan, First Secured Loan and
    Second Secured Loan”.  Further, the LPA contained a power of attorney in favour
    of the General Partner, authorizing it to execute the LPA and related documents,
    including promissory notes and loan documentation, on behalf of the affected
    limited partner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, the Subscription Form also included promissory notes
    relating to each category of financing loan.  In respect of the Second Loans,
    the “second secured note” in the Subscription Form (the “Second Notes”)
    provided that unless the investor paid the Second Loan portion of the
    subscription price at the time of subscription, the investor “promise[d] to pay
    to or to the order of the Partnership … on written demand made by the
    Partnership at any time the [amount of the Second Loan] without interest”.  The
    parties agree and the trial judge accepted that this promise to pay was the
    only security provided by an investor in respect of his or her Second Loan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Notes were signed by the General Partner on behalf of the investors
    pursuant to the powers of attorney granted by the investors.  As executed, the
    Second Notes stated that interest and principal on the Second Loans “shall
    become due and payable on the 31st day of August, 1994”.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)</span></i><i><span lang=EN-US>       Terms of Financing Loans</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The equity loans were arranged through a Canadian financial institution. 
    The OM provided that they were to be amortized over 15 years, have a three-year
    term and bear interest at the rate of “1½% over prime from time to time”. 
    Interest and principal were required to be paid on a monthly basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The First Loans were advanced by Confederation Trust Company.  According
    to the OM, they were to be amortized over 30 years, have a five-year term and bear
    interest at the “Confederation Trust prime residential rate plus ¼%”.  Payments
    on the First Loans were stated to be “repayable in blended monthly payments of
    principal and interest”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM also contemplated the refinancing of the First Loans.  The
    following refinancing clause was set out in the “Loans” section of the OM:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Refinancing</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The General Partner intends to arrange
    for the refinancing of the First Secured Loans to the extent possible for so long
    as the Second Secured Loans or any Cash Flow Loans remain outstanding.  Such
    refinancing would be in an amount equal to a maximum of 75% of the appraised
    value of the condominium suites comprising Riverside Towers at the time of
    refinancing.  The principal amount of the First Secured Loans may be increased
    on such a refinancing without the consent of the Limited Partners so long as
    the aggregate principal amount thereafter outstanding on the First Secured
    Loans and the Second Secured Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount of such
    loans on the date immediately preceding the date of such refinancing</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(the “Refinancing Clause”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Loans were advanced by the Fund and Skye, as the owners of
    the Property.  As payment of these loans is the central issue on the appeal, I set
    out in full the relevant provisions of the OM concerning the terms of the Second
    Loans:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The terms of the Second Secured Loans are to be as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Interest:         10.00%
    (increasing to Prime plus 3% if not repaid on or before August 31, 1994)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Payments:     Interest
    only; accrued until repaid from proceeds of refinancing of the First Secured
    Loan when the Second Secured Loan will be paid out</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(the “Payment Clause”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to security for the Second Loans, the OM stated:</p>

    August 31, 1994, the General Partner would provide funds, to the cumulative
    maximum amount of $2 million, to fund all “Cash Flow Deficiencies” of the
    Partnership and the total debt service deficiencies of the limited partners in
    respect of the First Loans.  The Cash Flow Loans advanced from time to time
    under this “Cash Flow Support Agreement” were subject to the same security
    provided by the investors in relation to the Second Loans, that is, to their
    personal promises to pay.  The obligations of the General Partner under the
    Cash Flow Support Agreement were secured by cash deposits in the sum of $2

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the OM, the Cash Flow Loans were to be repaid from two sources: (1)
    the Partnership’s operating cash flow, as defined under the OM, after the investors
    had been distributed “enough cash to pay the total debt service on the First
    Secured Loans”; and (2) “from the proceeds of any refinancing of the Property

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The closing of the transaction contemplated by the OM occurred at the
    end of August 1989.  Thereafter, the Partnership made payments under the First
    Loans on behalf of the investors and the Fund and Skye advanced funds under the
    Second Loans and the Cash Flow Loans.  In all, $2,898,422 was advanced in
    respect of the Second Loans and $1,710,493 was furnished via the Cash Flow
    Loans, exclusive of interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For their part, commencing in 1989 and continuing until at least 1997, the
    respondents, having subscribed for units in the Partnership, claimed and
    apparently received annual tax benefits including, in particular, tax deductions
    relating to the Partnership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1993 and 1994, a major real estate depression occurred.  As a result,
    some five years after the closing, the original intention of selling the
    apartments in the Property to end users as condominiums was not realized.  On
    notice to the respondents, the General Partner began to explore the refinancing
    of the Second Notes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When refinancing was not forthcoming, the appellants took the position
    that the Second Loans were due and payable by the respondents on or before
    August 31, 1994.  In the fall of 1994, the appellants demanded repayment of the
    Second Loans.  They maintained, and the trial judge accepted, that the
    Partnership succeeded in 1994 in obtaining an offer from Confederation Trust, the
    first secured lender, to refinance the First Loans and also made arrangements
    with the Bank of Montreal to permit the respondents to apply for refinancing of
    their Second Loans.  In the event, however, the respondents did not renew their
    First Loans or refinance their Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, the First Loans went into default and Confederation Trust
    sued for repayment.  In January 1997, with the respondents’ consent, the
    Property was sold and the proceeds of sale were used to discharge the
    respondents’ obligations under the First Loans.  No surplus funds were
    realized.  Thus, the amounts owing on the Second Loans remained unpaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the terms of the OM, the Cash Flow Loans became due
    in January 1997 when the First Loans were satisfied.  However, as the proceeds
    from the sale of the Property were insufficient to pay the Cash Flow Loans,
    they, too, remained outstanding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the investors paid the Second Loans and/or the Cash Flow Loans
    on demand but others did not.  Other investors settled with the appellants or filed
    for bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellants, approximately $31,500 per investor was owed
    on the Second Loans, while approximately $15,000 per investor was due on the
    Cash Flow Loans.  When payment was not made, the appellants commenced
    individual collection actions against the respondents.  The respondents defended
    the actions, maintaining that they were not required to pay the loans in
    question.  They also counterclaimed against the appellants, seeking damages and
    other relief for alleged misrepresentations in the OM about the value of the
    Partnership investment.  On consent, the various proceedings were consolidated
    and tried together in the Commercial Court.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.      Trial Judge’s
    Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted that by virtue of the subscription documents,
    the Second Loans were secured by the respondents’ individual promises to pay. 
    However, she concluded that the payment terms of the Second Loans, as set out
    in the OM, were ambiguous and confusing and, in these circumstances, that the
    OM should be construed against the appellants, the authors of the document.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also held that as the terms of the Second Notes did not
    accord with the payment terms for the Second Loans set out in the OM, the
    Second Notes were not authorized by the powers of attorney granted by the
    respondents to the General Partner.  Consequently, the respondents were not
    bound by the Second Notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the trial judge ruled that the respondents were not
    contractually obliged to pay the Second Loans under either the OM or the Second
    Notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reached a similar conclusion regarding the respondents’
    alleged obligations to pay the Cash Flow Loans.  In her view: “[T]he OM
    language of the liability for the cash flow loan is even more obtuse than that
    relating to the second secured loan”: at para. 122.  She elaborated in the same
    paragraph of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The cash flow loan is not included in the detailed
    description of loans in the “Loan” section of the OM nor in the sub-scription
    form.  In addition, while the grant of the power of attorney specifically
    refers to the equity loan, the first secured loan, and the second secured loan,
    no express reference is made to liability for the cash flow loan.  The selling
    documents are equally unclear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge therefore ruled that the respondents were not
    contractually obliged to pay the Cash Flow Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the respondents’ counterclaim, the trial judge held that
    the respondents were not entitled to rely on the deemed reliance component of
    the Contrac-tual Rights Clause for the purpose of their misrepresentations
    claim.  Moreover, and in any event, the trial judge concluded that none of the
    various matters complained of by the respondents constituted an actionable
    misrepresentation by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, by judgment dated October 31, 2008, the trial judge
    dismissed the appellants’ collection actions, granted associated declaratory
    relief to the respondents, and dismissed the respondents’ counterclaim.  The
    appellants appeal and the respondents cross-appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by concluding that the appellants did not

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>V.        Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        The Appeal</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1)       Liability
    to Pay Second Loans</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute concerning the nature of the obligation under the
    Second Loans, or that it was secured by the respondents’ individual promises to
    pay.  The issue is when and how the respondents’ obligations to pay the Second
    Loans were triggered, if at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the trial judge that the respondents are not contractually
    liable to pay the Second Loans.  I reach this conclusion for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin, there was ample justification for the trial judge’s holding
    that the terms of the OM relating to payment of the Second Loans are
    ambiguous.  Recall that the Payment Clause in the OM relating to the Second
    Loans states in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Payments:     Interest
    only; accrued until repaid from proceeds of refinancing of the First Secured
    Loan when the Second Secured Loan will be paid out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first blush, the Payment Clause can be read as relating only to the
    obligation to pay interest on the Second Loans.  This interpretation arises
    from the use of the words “interest only” and “accrued until repaid” in the
    Payment Clause.  Interest accrues or accumulates over time.  In contrast,
    principal indebtedness is fixed at the time a loan is made and does not
    “accumulate” or “accrue” in the normal sense of those words.  The parties did
    not contest that the notion of “accrual” under the Payment Clause is referable
    to interest only.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Payment Clause contains no express mention of payment of
    the principal owed under the Second Loans.  This stands in stark contrast to
    the payment terms for the equity and First Loans.  Those terms, which are set
    out in the OM immediately before the Payment Clause concerning the Second
    Loans, expressly con-template monthly payments of “interest and principal” (the
    equity loans) and “blended monthly payments of principal and interest” (the
    First Loans).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Payment Clause also contains the following language:
    “accrued until repaid from proceeds of refinancing of the First Secured Loan <i>when
    the Second Secured Loan will be paid out</i>” (emphasis added).  Nothing in
    this phrase or the context in which it is used suggests that it refers only to
    interest.  The phrase is unqualified.  Thus, on a plain reading, the phrase refers
    to the “Second Secured Loan” as a whole, that is, to both principal and
    interest.  This suggests that the Payment Clause establishes the terms of
    payment for principal, as well as interest, owed on the Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, and importantly, the Payment Clause also addresses the source
    of funds to be used for payment.  It refers to the refinancing of the “first
    secured loan” and states that the funds accrued – namely, interest – will be
    paid from the proceeds of such refinancing.  On this reading, the trigger for
    the payment of interest was a refinancing of the First Loan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the Payment Clause can also be read more broadly, such that the
    Second Loan in its entirety was to be paid “from proceeds of refinancing of the
    First Secured Loan”.  The trial judge concluded that this was a reasonable
    interpretation of the Payment Clause, reasoning in part as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The Payment Clause] speaks of payment terms that
    are interest only and includes a term that suggests that the loan was going to
    be repaid on a refinancing of the first secured loan.  <i>A reasonable reading
    of the OM would suggest that while there was a personal covenant to pay, it was
    never triggered in the absence of a refinancing.  Put differently, it was
    subject to a precondition that there be a refinancing and that the Limited
    Partners would account for their share</i>.  The only relevant identified risk
    in the OM was that refinancing on as favourable terms may be unavailable not
    that refinancing would be totally unavailable.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the trial judge that the Payment Clause may reasonably be
    understood as providing that payment of accrued interest on the Second Loan was
    to be made on and from the proceeds of any refinancing of the First Loan and
    that the principal owing on the Second Loan was also to be paid when such a
    refinancing occurred.  Read in this fashion, a refinancing of the First Loan
    was the trigger or, as the trial judge put it, a “precondition” to the payment
    of both interest and principal on the Second Loan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Payment Clause can be interpreted in two different and conflicting
    ways: (1) as requiring only the payment of accrued interest on the Second Loan
    at the time of a refinancing of the First Loan; or (2) as requiring payment of
    the entire Second Loan, inclusive of outstanding principal and accrued
    interest, when that refinancing occurred.  These interpretations cannot live
    together.  Either the Payment Clause deals with payment of the principal owed
    on the Second Loan or it does not.  In these circumstances, the trial judge cannot
    be faulted for holding that the Payment Clause is ambiguous. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenge this conclusion on several grounds.  First,
    they submit that the OM must be read as a whole and in the overall context of
    the Partnership investment envisaged by the OM and the other subscription
    documents, with a view to ascertaining and giving effect to the intention and
    reasonable expectations of the parties and the need to interpret the OM in a
    commercially sensible fashion.  I did not understand the respondents to
    dispute, and I agree, that these are the controlling interpretive principles:
    see for example, <i>Bell Canada v. The Plan Group</i> (2009), 96 O.R. (3d) 81
    (C.A.), at paras. 37 and 170.  There is no suggestion that the trial judge
    failed to identify the applicable principles of contractual interpretation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants go on to assert that the proper application of these
    principles in this case results in the conclusion that the respondents were
    required to pay the principal and interest on the Second Loans by August 31,
    1994.  In support of this assertion, the appellants point first to the
    respondents’ acknowledgement contained in paragraph 45 of the agreed statement
    of facts, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Interest under each of the Second Secured Loans
    accrued at the rate of 10 per cent per year.  <i>Principal with interest under
    the Second Secured Loans became due and payable on August 31, 1994</i>. 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also rely on the provisions of the Second Notes, which
    indicate that interest and principal on the Second Loans “shall become due and
    payable on the 31st day of August, 1994” and which contain each investor’s
    personal covenant to pay the Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants further submit that to interpret the OM and associated
    Partnership subscription documents as failing to oblige the respondents to pay
    the Second Loans in full is commercially unreasonable.  This interpretation,
    they contend, means that not-withstanding the respondents’ personal covenants
    to pay, the debt obligation underlying the Second Loans in effect “disappears”
    or “evaporates”.  Thus, the appellants argue, the trial judge’s conclusion that
    the respondents are not contractually obliged to pay the Second Loans cannot
    stand in the face of the respondents’ admitted personal covenants to pay the
    Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants seek to buttress these arguments by emphasizing that
    the respondents realized significant tax benefits, in particular, tax
    deductions relating to interest on the First and Second Loans and Partnership
    losses, for several years.  Pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Act
    and related policies of the Ontario Securities Commission, the tax benefits
    relating to the Second Loans would have been unavailable to the respondents, as
    a matter of law, if the respondents were not “at risk” in respect of these
    loans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject these arguments for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned earlier, the Subscription Form completed by each investor
    stated that an investor acquired a unit in the Partnership “on the terms and as
    described in the [OM]”.  Accordingly, the investors’ contractual obligations
    were established by the OM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM, however, contains provisions that are inconsistent with the
    contention that the investors were liable to pay the Second Loans in full on or
    before August 31, 1994.  Three examples will illustrate this point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Payment Clause contemplates an adjusted rate of interest on
    the Second Loans.  It states that interest on these loans, initially 10%, would
    increase to “Prime plus 3% if not repaid on or before August 31, 1994”.  Thus,
    this part of the Payment Clause itself recognizes that at least the interest
    and, therefore, at least part of the principal owed on the Second Loans might
    not be paid until after August 31, 1994.  Obviously, this is inconsistent with
    the notion that the respondents were contractually obliged to repay the
    entirety of the Second Loans by August 31, 1994 or, indeed, by any fixed date
    if a refinancing of the First Loans did not take place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the OM provides that the term of a property management agreement
    concerning the Property “expires on the later of August 31, 1999 and the date
    that both the Cash Flow Loans and the Second Secured Loans have been repaid in
    full”.  This provision also leaves open the possibility that payment of the
    Second Loans could occur on a date other than on or before August 31, 1994.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in the description of the Partnership financing set out in the
    OM, the following clause appears:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Second Secured Loan is assumed to bear simple
    interest at 10% per annum non-compounding which will be accrued.  <i>It is
    assumed that the accrued interest and principal will be paid out at the end of
    a five year period ending August 31, 1994</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this clause supports the argument that the parties anticipated
    payment of both principal and interest on the Second Loans by August 31, 1994,
    this is expressed as an assumption.  The clause does not state that investors
    will be required to actually pay either interest or principal on the Second
    Loans on or before August 31, 1994.  This clause is the only provision in the
    OM that refers expressly to the payment of principal on the Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps more importantly, the appellants’ interpretation of the
    investors’ obligations concerning the Second Loans does not take adequate
    account of the refinancing language of the OM in general, and of the Payment
    Clause in particular.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM must be read as a whole.  Under the OM, the refinancing of the
    First Loans was to be arranged by the General Partner, “to the extent
    possible”.  While the OM did not impose an absolute obligation on the General
    Partner to obtain such refinancing, it did assign the burden of attempting to
    obtain it exclusively on the General Partner.  This assignment of
    responsibility was consistent with the General Manager’s broadly cast powers
    under the LPA regarding the Partnership and, correspondingly, with the narrow
    reach of the investors’ powers concerning the Partnership, again as set out in
    the LPA.  Thus, it was the Partnership, acting through the General Manager,
    that bore the risk of a refinancing failure – not the investors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, as the trial judge noted, the list of the “risk factors”
    pertaining to the Partnership investment disclosed in the OM did not include a
    refinancing failure.  Rather, the only refinancing risk identified was the
    potential that the Partnership would be unable to refinance the First Loans “on
    terms as favourable as those available on the Closing Date”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These provisions of the OM assist in the interpretation of the
    refinancing contemplated by the Payment Clause.  In my view, they also undercut
    the appellants’ claim that the trial judge’s interpretation of the Payment
    Clause leads to a commercially absurd result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, when the Payment Clause is read in conjunction with the
    financing and refinancing provisions of the OM, including the Refinancing Clause
    quoted earlier in these reasons, the Payment Clause can be viewed as
    contemplating that the First Loans would be refinanced, pursuant to the General
    Partner’s contractual undertaking to attempt to arrange such refinancing, in an
    amount sufficient to fully retire both accrued interest and outstanding
    principal on the Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This interpretation of the Payment Clause does not yield a commercially
    absurd result.  Nor does it mean that the obligation underlying the Second
    Loans disappears, along with any liability on the part of the respondents for
    payment of the debt created by the Second Loans.  It simply means that if the
    First Loans were successfully refinanced for a higher principal amount, and the
    Second Loans were paid in full from the refinancing proceeds, the quantum of
    the respondents’ liability on the First Loans would be increased.  The
    respondents would remain liable for the full amount of the refinanced First
    Loans and for any renegotiated interest rate on those loans, including a
    potentially higher interest rate.  This was the adverse refinancing risk
    forecast as a “risk factor” in the OM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, under this scenario, if the First Loans were not refinanced
    before August 31, 1994, thus delaying the payout of the Second Loans, the
    respondents’ liability for interest on the Second Loans would increase in
    accordance with the stipulation in the Payment Clause for a higher interest
    rate after August 31, 1994.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, therefore, on a refinancing of the First Loans, the
    respondents’ liability for the debt created by the Second Loans would continue,
    although in the substituted form of larger First Loans.  That liability is to
    be distinguished from an obligation to discharge the liability by paying the
    Second Loans at a set time, in the absence of a refinancing of the First
    Loans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge implicitly recognized this, when she commented at para.
    113 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In attempting to construe the parties’ intentions,
    it is reasonable to conclude that, while at risk, the parties contemplated that
    refinancing would be available and that the second secured loans would be
    repaid on that refinancing.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same paragraph of her reasons, the trial judge went on to say: “The
    language of the OM and the surrounding circumstances support this
    interpretation.”  This comment was grounded in the evidence.  It is
    well-established that the primary goal of contractual interpretation is to give
    effect to the intentions of the parties: see for example, <i>Dunn v. Chubb
    Insurance Company of Canada</i> (2009), 97 O.R. (3d) 701 (C.A.), at para. 32; <i>Bell
    Canada</i>, at para. 37.  In this case, as I have said, various additional
    documents apart from the OM were used by the appellants to market the
    Partnership investment.  These documents formed part of the surrounding
    circumstances – the factual matrix – of the Partnership investment and, hence,
    could be examined by the trial judge to determine the intent of the parties at
    the time of investment in the Partnership: see <i>Dunn</i>, at para. 33-34 and
    note 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of these documents, the “green sheets”, contained an Executive
    Summary of the Partnership investment that was prepared for “internal use” by
    dealers involved in the marketing effort.  It contained the following description
    of the Second Loans:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The second loan carries characteristics of a second
    mortgage and has been created as a vendor take back scenario.  The promoter
    will loan the partnership $3,775,000 at a rate of 10% for five years.  <i>This
    is to be capitalized by the Partner-ship and paid out upon a sale or
    refinancing by Limited Partners at the time of title distribution after
    September 1, 1994</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This contemporaneous description of the Second Loans, authored by the
    promoters themselves, strongly supports the trial judge’s conclusion that payment
    of the Second Loans was contingent on a refinancing of the First Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was also some evidence that the investors themselves understood
    that their admitted liability on the Second Loans was to be satisfied on a refinancing
    of the First Loans.  One of the investors testified at trial as to his
    understanding, at the time that demand was made on the Second Loans, that if
    the General Partner could not “increase the first mortgage sufficiently” to pay
    the Second Loans, the investors were obliged to pay only the adjusted rate of
    interest on the Second Loans provided for in the Payment Clause.  It is telling
    that at about the same time, in mid-August 1994, the Partnership wrote to the
    investors informing them: “With regard to the possibility of refinancing the
    second secured loan <i>with an up-financing of the first mortgage</i>, we have
    found that property values had not risen to a level where this was available”
    (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I agree with the trial judge that the terms of the Second Notes
    do not establish an obligation by the respondents to pay the Second Loans in
    the absence of a refinancing of the First Loans. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Notes were executed on behalf of investors by the General
    Partner pursuant to the powers of attorney granted by the investors.  Unlike
    the OM, the Second Notes expressly stated that payment of the principal and
    interest on the Second Loans was due on August 31, 1994.  In this significant
    respect, as the trial judge found, the language of the Second Notes did not
    conform with that of the OM regarding payment of the Second Loans.  And it was
    the OM that established the rights and obligations of the investors.  Nothing
    in the investors’ powers of attorney authorized the General Partner to unilaterally
    alter or expand the payment terms of the Second Loans and, hence, the
    investors’ liability for those loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize, there were aspects of the OM, including of the Payment
    Clause, concerning payment of the Second Loans that were ambiguous.  However, when
    the OM is read as a whole, in light of the circumstances surrounding the
    offering and the financing and refinancing provisions of the OM, it is my view
    that the Payment Clause is not ambiguous and the principle of <i>contra
    proferentem</i> is not engaged.  Properly read, the OM contemplated payment of
    accrued interest and outstanding principal on the Second Loans when a
    refinancing of the First Loans acceptable to the parties was achieved.  The
    promoters marketed the Partnership investment on this basis, but this did not
    occur.  Accordingly, the trial judge was correct to hold that the respondents
    are not contractually obliged to pay the Second Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add that if I am wrong in this conclusion, and the OM (in
    particular, the Payment Clause) must be viewed as ambiguous with respect to the
    respondents’ obligations to fully pay the Second Loans, I regard the trial
    judge’s reliance on the <i>contra proferentem</i> principle as fully justified
    in the circumstances of this case.  As observed by this court in <i>Dunn</i>,
    at para. 36, while the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i> is an interpretive
    rule of last resort, it may be applied to resolve an ambiguity against the
    party who drafted the contract in question.  As found by the trial judge, the
    application of the doctrine in this case requires that the OM be construed
    against the appellants in respect of the respondents’  liability to pay the
    Second Loans.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span

lang=EN-US>      Liability to Pay Cash Flow Loans</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also have no difficulty in concluding that the trial judge was correct
    to hold that the respondents are not contractually liable to pay the Cash Flow
    Loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OM does not stipulate that the investors were responsible to pay
    these loans.  On the contrary, the OM indicates that they were to be paid from
    the Partnership’s operating cash flow or from the proceeds of any refinancing
    “of the Property”.  Nor do the related subscription documents describe the
    funds advanced under the Cash Flow Support Agreement as an investor’s liability
    or a loan to the investors, although the Cash Flow Loans were secured by the
    investors’ personal promises to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, as the trial judge observed, the Subscription Form did not
    contain any promise or commitment by the investors to pay the Cash Flow Loans. 
    In the absence of such a covenant by the limited partners, the powers of
    attorney granted to the General Partner did not extend to the creation of new
    or different investor liability.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        Cross-appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their counterclaim, the respondents alleged that the appellants
    materially misrepresented the value of the Partnership investment in the OM,
    thereby entitling the respondents to damages, relief in the nature of
    rescission of their Partnership investments, and associated declaratory
    relief.  To succeed in these claims, the respondents were required to establish
    material misrepresentations by the appellants and reliance by the respondents
    on those misrepresentations, to their detriment.  Failure to prove either of
    these requirements was fatal to the respondents’ counterclaim.  The trial judge
    ruled that neither requirement had been satisfied.</p>
  <h4 style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Scope
    of the Contractual Rights      </span></h4>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Clause: Deemed
    Reliance</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the reliance requirement.  At trial, the respondents did
    not assert actual reliance.  Instead, they relied on the deemed reliance
    component of the Contractual Rights Clause contained in the OM.  Under that
    provision, if the OM contained any misrepresentation at the time of an
    investor’s purchase of a Partnership unit, the investor was “deemed to have
    relied on such misrepresentation” and had a right of action for damages, or the
    right to elect to exercise a right of rescission, against the Partnership.  The
    Contractual Rights Clause expressed these rights as alternatives.  It also
    stated that they were “in addition to any other right or remedy available at
    law”.  Further, the rights afforded under the Contractual Rights Clause were
    time-limited.  Both the right of action for damages and the right to elect to
    exercise a right of rescission required “notice given to the Partnership not
    later than 90 days after the date of payment for the Units acquired by [the
    investor]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Timely notice in accordance with the Contractual Rights Clause was not
    given by the respondents in this case.  Accordingly, they could not invoke
    either of the contractual rights provided for under the Contractual Rights
    Clause.  However, they argued at trial that the provision applied to more than
    the specific rights identified and, as asserted in their factum before this
    court, that it provided the respondents “with the right to deemed reliance for
    all rights or remedies based on a misrepresentation in the [OM]”.  Thus, the
    respondents maintained that, as worded, the deemed reliance component of the
    Contractual Rights Clause was not restricted to the two time-limited rights
    expressly contemplated by the provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge disagreed.  She held that the Contractual Rights Clause
    was unambiguous and that it was limited in scope to “the special time limited
    statute based remedies” mentioned in the provision.  In this proceeding, the
    respondents renew their arguments regarding the Contractual Rights Clause and
    submit that the trial judge erred by interpreting it too narrowly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to emphasize the legislative origins of the Contractual
    Rights Clause.  The OM, as I have indicated, was issued pursuant to the
    so-called “sophisticated investor” prospectus-exemption then provided for under
    s. 71(1)(d) of the Act and O. Reg. 910, R.R.O. 1980 (the “Regulation”).  This
    exemption applied where a purchaser purchased a security as a principal and the
    trade was in a security that had a cost to the purchaser of not less than
    $150,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To rely on this exemption, certain legislative requirements had to be
    met.  One of these, set out under s. 21(3) of the Regulation, required that the
    OM include a “contractual right of action” against the issuers of the OM (in
    this case, the Partnership) for damages or rescission where the OM contained a
    misrepresentation.  Section 21(1)(a) of the Regulation defined “contractual
    right of action” as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“contractual right of action” means a right of action against an issuer
    for rescission or damages, which right,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is available to an investor … if the offering memorandum contains a
    misrepresentation,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is exercisable on notice given to the issuer not later than 90 days
    after the date on which pay-ment was made for the securities or after the
    initial payment …,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>reasonably corresponds to the rights provided in section 126 of the Act
    applicable to a prospectus …, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>includes a provision stating that the right is in addition to any other
    right or remedy available at law to the investor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably, under subparagraph (iii) of this definition, the requisite
    contractual right of action had to “reasonably correspond” to the rights set
    out in s. 126 of the Act as applicable to a prospectus.  Those rights included
    deemed reliance by a purchaser of a security on a misrepresentation contained
    in a prospectus, such that the purchaser was “deemed to have relied on such
    misrepresentation if it was a misrepresentation at the time of purchase”. 
    Where such deemed reliance applied, s. 126(1) also stated that the purchaser
    had a right of action for damages or a right to elect to exercise a right of
    rescission against, among others, the issuer of the prospectus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the Contractual Rights Clause was included in
    the OM to conform with these requirements of the Act and the Regulation.  The
    critical issue is whether, as drafted, the Contractual Rights Clause provided
    for broadly-based deemed reliance by investors, applicable to all rights of
    action whether under the Act or at common law, rather than deemed reliance in
    the narrower context of only the two statutory-based rights specifically
    identified in the Contractual Rights Clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the Contractual Rights Clause did not
    “confer any greater rights on the Limited Partners” than those envisaged by the
    Act and the Regulation.  At paragraph 143 of her reasons, she stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It makes little sense to construe the OM [the
    Contractual Rights Clause] in the manner favoured by the Limited Partners
    either from an interpretive or business perspective.  In addition, it would
    render actual reliance irrelevant and also renders the 90 day provision largely
    meaningless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.  Simply put, the Contractual Rights Clause does not bear the
    expansive interpretation urged by the respondents.  It is clearly designed to
    respond and is confined to the legislative contractual right of action provided
    for under the Act and the Regulation.  I see no indication in the Contractual
    Rights Clause of an augmented investor entitlement to deemed reliance for the
    purpose of causes of action beyond those specifically identified in the
    provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also
    agree with the trial judge that this interpretive conclusion is reinforced by
    two compelling factors.  First, the effect of the interpretation of the
    Contractual Rights Clause urged by the respondents is to abrogate entirely, for
    the purpose of all causes of action, the need for a showing of actual reliance. 
    In my view, had such a significant concession regarding liability to suit been
    intended by the Partnership promoters, much clearer contractual language would
    have been required and employed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, on
    the respondents’ view of the Contractual Rights Clause, the 90-day notice requirement
    for the exercise of the right to an action for damages or the right to elect to
    exercise a right of rescission would never apply.  An investor would be
    entitled to rely on contractual deemed reliance for any cause of action at any
    time after the purchase of an interest in a prospectus-exempt security
    offering.  This would run counter to the contractual right of action provisions
    of the Act and the Regulation and expose the issuer of a prospectus-exempt
    offering to indefinite liability.  Such an interpretation makes little sense
    from a policy perspective.  It would seriously undermine the important goal of promoting
    certainty in commercial transactions of the kind at issue in this case.  See
    for example, <i>Bell Canada</i>, at para. 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore
    reject the respondents’ challenge to the trial judge’s inter-pretation of the
    Contractual Rights Clause.  I agree with her interpretation.  The respondents,
    therefore, are unable to rely on deemed reliance under the Contractual Rights
    Clause to ground their claims against the appellants.  As those claims were
    advanced outside the 90-day notice period set out in the Contractual Rights
    Clause and actual reliance on the appellants’ alleged misrepresentations was
    not claimed, the respondents’ counterclaim could not succeed.  On this ground
    alone, the counterclaim was unsustainable.</p>

lang=EN-US>      Finding of No Misrepresentations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light
    of my conclusion that the respondents are unable to resort to the Contractual
    Rights Clause, it is unnecessary to address their companion attack on the trial
    judge’s finding that the appellants did not misrepresent the value of the
    Partnership investment in the OM.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>VI.      Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the
    reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal.  As success in
    this court is divided, I agree with the parties that no award of the costs of
    this proceeding is appropriate.</p>
