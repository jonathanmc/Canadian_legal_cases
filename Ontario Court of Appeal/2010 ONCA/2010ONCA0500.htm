  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court: </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Bank of Montreal (the “Bank”), appeals from the trial
    judge’s decision awarding the respondent, S.N.S. Industrial Products Limited
    (“SNS”), the sum of $186,488 for losses arising from forged cheques drawn on
    its account with the Bank, together with prejudgment interest and costs.  SNS
    cross-appeals from the trial judgment, seeking further compensatory damages in
    the amount of $66,000 on account of additional forged cheques drawn on its
    account and an award of punitive damages against the Bank in the amount of
    $132,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, both the appeal and cross-appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.         The Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue on appeal concerns the interpretation of a verification
    of account clause (the “Verification Clause”) in a banking agreement between
    the parties that was in force when various cheques were improperly drawn on
    SNS’ account with the Bank by an SNS employee who forged the signature of SNS’
    authorized signing officer on the cheques.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Verification Clause read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.5       The Bank shall render each month (unless
    otherwise instructed in writing) to the Corporation a statement of its account
    together with cheques and other vouchers where applicable for amounts charged
    to the said account.  The Corporation will advise the Bank promptly if the
    monthly statement has not been received within ten days of the date upon which
    it is normally received.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.6       Upon receipt of the aforesaid statement
    of account, the Corporation will check the debit and credit entries, examine
    the cheques and vouchers and notify the Bank in writing of any errors,
    irregularities or omissions.  This notice will be provided to the Bank within
    30 days of the mailing to the Corporation or if not mailed, within 30 days of
    the delivery to the Corporation.  At the expiration of the 30 day period
    (except as to any alleged errors, irregularities or omissions outlined on the
    said notice) it shall be conclusively settled between the Bank and the
    Corporation, subject to the right of the Bank either during or after the 30 day
    period to charge back items for which payment has not been received, that the
    statement and the balance shown thereon are correct, the said cheques and
    vouchers are properly charged to the Corpora-tion’s account and the Corporation
    is not entitled to be credited with any sum not credited in the statement.  It
    shall be conclusively settled as between the Bank and the Corporation that the
    Bank is not liable for any loss or claim arising from the breach by the
    Corporation or any third party of any fiduciary duty or trust in respect of the
    sums or dealings noted in the said statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SNS sued the Bank for recovery of the amount of the forged cheques that
    were debited to its account by the Bank, relying on s. 48(1) of the <i>Bills of
    Exchange Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B. 4.  Under that provision, “where a
    signature on a bill of exchange is forged, or placed thereon without the
    authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, the forged or
    unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative…”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank defended the action, arguing that the Verification Clause
    provided a complete defence to SNS’ claim.  The trial judge disagreed.  He held,
    in effect, that the Verification Clause did not apply to forged cheques because
    the honouring of a forged cheque did not constitute an “error, irregularity or
    omission” within the meaning of those terms as used in the Verification Clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that the Verification Clause does not afford a valid defence to
    the Bank in this case, although for reasons that differ somewhat from those of
    the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicable principles of contractual interpretation are
    well-established.  As this court recently stated in <i>Dunn v. Chubb Insurance
    Company of Canada</i> (2009), 97 O.R. (3d) 701 (C.A.), at para. 32, “The primary
    goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the intentions of the
    parties.”  See also <i>Bell Canada v. The Plan Group</i> (2009), 96 O.R. (3d)
    81 (C.A.), at para. 37.  In accordance with the normal rules of construction,
    the court searches for an interpretation of a disputed contract which, from the
    whole of the document, “would appear to promote or advance the true intent of
    the parties at the time of entry into the contract”: <i>Consolidated-Bathurst
    Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888,
    at p. 901.  In this interpretive inquiry, the context or factual matrix
    surrounding the contract is relevant.  As this court has indicated, commercial
    contracts are to be interpreted, “with regard to objective evidence of the factual
    matrix underlying the negotiation of the contract, but without reference to the
    subjective intention of the parties”: <i>Dunn</i>, at para. 34, note 4
    (citations omitted).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Verification Clause does not refer expressly to forged cheques or
    otherwise to cheques debited to a customer’s account for improper purposes or
    by illegal means.  Further, the terms “error”, “irregularity” and “omission”
    are not defined in the Verification Clause.  Nor is their meaning clear on a
    plain reading of the Verification Clause as a whole.  Thus, the meaning of
    these terms is not apparent on the face of the Verification Clause.  Certainly,
    the scope of these terms would not be self-evident to many, if any, customers
    of the Bank without clarification or explanation.  It is difficult to conceive,
    therefore, absent evidence to the contrary that does not exist in this case,
    that both parties intended, when the banking agreement was entered into, that
    the Verification Clause would extend to forged cheques honoured by the Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the Bank was free to include a specific definition or other
    clarification of these terms in the Verification Clause if it wished to do so. 
    Indeed, the evidence at trial, and the Bank’s own pleading, established that
    the Bank included specific reference to forgery – albeit in the context of
    cheque endorsements – in a subsequent version of a verification of account
    clause in a later banking agreement with this same customer – SNS. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the Verification Clause imposed certain obligations on
    SNS in relation to monthly account statements furnished by the Bank.  It is
    also true that the Verification Clause afforded certain protections to the
    Bank, which were designed to limit its liability, if SNS did not fulfil its
    obligations under the Verification Clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But in this case, when SNS sought specific information from the Bank
    regarding the timelines for verification of its account entries, it was
    informed in a memorandum by its contact at the Bank as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Message:</b>  Hi Don,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As requested by Choui and Tara here is the
    information you requested:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Forged Endorsement – there is no time line if there is a forged
    endorsement on cheques, there is a declaration form that needs to be filled out
    and signed for the file.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Altered Cheques – if a cheque is altered you have 90 days following
    receipt of the cheque, there is a declaration form that needs to be filled out
    and signed for the file as well.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counterfeit Items – if a cheque is counterfeit you have 24 hours
    following receipt of the cheque to have it returned.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stolen – if a cheque is stolen, you notify the bank immediately and we
    put a stop payment on it.  After 6 months the cheque becomes stale dated and
    will not be processed for this reason.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This memorandum can only have left SNS with the impression that no
    verification timeline applied and, therefore, that the Verification Clause did
    not apply, to forged cheques.  We note that the subject heading to the
    memorandum read: “Timeline for Forged/Altered/Counterfeit/Stolen Cheques”.  No
    distinction was drawn in the memorandum between forged “endorsements” and other
    types of cheque forgeries.  Moreover, the memorandum set out applicable
    timelines for the recovery of funds from the Bank in relation to altered,
    counterfeit and stolen cheques.  There was no indication that forged cheques
    not involving forged “endorsements” fell into a separate and more exacting
    verification category.  There is no suggestion that the information contained
    in the memorandum was withdrawn or corrected at any time by the Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Verification of account clauses of the type at issue here form part of
    the Bank’s standard form account documents prepared by the Bank to govern its
    relations with its customers.  We agree with SNS that clauses of this kind are
    to be construed strictly and, in the event of any ambiguity, against the Bank,
    as the author of the clause, in accordance with the doctrine of <i>contra
    preferentem</i>: see <i>Dunn</i>, at para. 36. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A forged cheque is not simply a bill of exchange that does not conform
    with requisite formalities.  As properly acknowledged by the Bank before this
    court, it is an invalid cheque for want of proper authorization.  By operation
    of s. 48(1) of the <i>Bills of Exchange Act</i>, except for specific
    circumstances that are inapplicable here, a forged signature on a cheque is
    “wholly inoperative”.  It might reasonably be expected, therefore, that any
    intention by the parties to include forged cheques in the ambit of the
    Verification Clause would have been stated in clear and unambiguous language. 
    That did not occur in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all these circumstances, we are not persuaded that the Verification
    Clause operates in this case to afford the Bank a defence to SNS’ claim.  The
    trial judge was therefore correct to hold that the Verification Clause did not
    exempt the Bank from liability under s. 48(1) of the <i>Bills of Exchange Act</i>. 
    We endorse the trial judge’s observation that, on this record, it appears that “[no
    one] on either side gave the verification agreement a thought”.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Cross-Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two aspects to SNS’ cross-appeal.  First, SNS argues that the
    trial judge erred by failing to award additional compensatory damages in the
    amount of $66,000 for other cheques allegedly forged by SNS’ employee and
    honoured by the Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject this claim.  The focus of SNS’ pleading was on compensation
    for forged cheques totalling $186,488.  This is the amount eventually awarded
    to SNS by the trial judge.  SNS led no properly admissible evidence at trial to
    prove forged cheques in any additional amount.  As the Bank points out, various
    means were available to SNS to do so, including: the calling of evidence from
    the police officers involved in the forgery investigation; moving prior to or
    at trial to compel production by the Bank of copies of the additional cheques
    that the police regarded as forged; or, cross-examining the Bank’s witnesses at
    trial concerning these additional cheques.  SNS, however, failed to take any of
    these steps.  In these circumstances, the trial judge was fully justified in
    concluding that SNS had failed to meet its evidential burden to prove the honouring
    by the Bank of forged cheques in excess of those reflected in the compensatory
    damages awarded by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second aspect of SNS’ cross-appeal concerns its renewed claim that
    it is entitled to punitive damages.  The trial judge fully considered and
    rejected this claim.  On the factual findings of the trial judge, he was right
    to do so.  We note, in particular, the trial judge’s findings that SNS’
    employee “did a good job at forging the signature of her principals”; that the
    Bank was not negligent for cashing the cheques in question; and that while the
    Bank’s conduct, including its treatment of SNS after the fraud was discovered,
    was “inefficient and unimpressive”, it was not “such as to give rise to
    aggravated or punitive damages”.  We see no basis on which to interfere with
    these findings or with the trial judge’s ruling that punitive damages were not
    warranted.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.      Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given, the appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed.  As
    success has been divided, we make no order as to the costs of this proceeding.</p>
