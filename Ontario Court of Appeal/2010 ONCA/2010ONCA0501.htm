  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the legal capacity of a non-corporate statutory
    entity, whose conduct is subject to supervision by way of judicial review, to
    be sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Also in issue is whether a
    reasonable cause of action is disclosed by a pleading in which allegations of
    bad faith, malice and bias are advanced against the non-corporate statutory
    entity and certain of its members.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.         Facts</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1)       The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Gratton-Masuy Environmental Technologies Inc. (c.o.b. as
    Ecoflo Ontario) and Waterloo Biofilter Systems Inc., provide on-site sewage treatment
    systems in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, the Building Materials Evaluation Commission (the
    “Commission”), is a statutory body continued under s. 28(1) of the <i>Building
    Code Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 23 (the “Act”).  It is comprised of part-time
    members, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council under the Act, who are
    engineers, designers, manufacturers, contractors, consultants and former
    municipal officials.  The individual respondents are current or former members
    of the Commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commission’s statutory powers and duties are set out in s. 28(4) of
    the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>28. (4)     The [Commission] may,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)  conduct research on, and examine, construction
    materials, systems and building designs or cause such research to be conducted
    and examinations to be undertaken;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)  upon application therefor, authorize the use,
    subject to any conditions that may be set out, of any innovative mater-ial,
    system or building design in respect of any building or part thereof; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)  make recommendations to the Minister
    respecting changes in this Act or the building code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown is named as a party in her representative capacity, pursuant
    to the provisions of the <i>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P. 27 (the “<i>PACA</i>”).  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (2)       The Authorizations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ sewage treatment systems use filtration media to
    pre-treat septic tank effluent prior to its discharge into the natural
    environment.  On April 29, 1999, the Commission granted authorizations under
    the Act to the appellants for the use of their filter-based sewage treatment
    units with a soil absorption system, known as an “area bed”, which was designed
    by the appellants in the mid-1990s to treat effluent (the “Authorizations”).  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       First
    Review of the Authorizations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late June 2001, the Commission initiated a review of the appellants’
    sewage treatment systems.  This eventually led to a decision by the Commission to
    amend the Authorizations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought judicial review of the Commission’s decision to
    amend the Authorizations.  In support of their application, they argued that the
    Commission had no jurisdiction to reconsider and amend the Authorizations.  In the
    alternative, they maintained that they had been denied natural justice and
    procedural fairness in the Commission’s review process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court concluded that the Commission had the legislative
    authority to reconsider the Authorizations, reasoning in part as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In fulfilling its adjudicative role, the
    [Commission] must be alive to issues of public health and safety, as this is
    the purpose of its enabling legislation.  It seems almost axiomatic that a
    tribunal that is concerned with innovative materials, systems, or building
    design must be able to respond to new information that may subsequently become
    available and to act on this information where the protection of public health
    and safety warrants.  This would logically have to take place not only where it
    is determined that the technology is performing unsatisfactorily, but also
    where a <i>potential</i> danger to the public arises.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>See <i>Gratton-Masuy Environmental Technologies Inc. (d.b.a.
    Ecoflo Ontario) v. Building Materials Evaluation Commission</i> (2002), 60 O.R.
    (3d) 245 (Div. Ct.), (“<i>Gratton-Masuy</i>”), at para. 22.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Divisional Court also accepted the appellants’ argument
    that the Commission had failed to provide them with adequate notice and a
    meaningful oppor-tunity to be heard in respect of the amendments to the
    Authorizations.  Accordingly, by judgment dated June 18, 2002, the Divisional
    Court granted the appellants’ judicial review application and remitted the
    matter back to the Commission “for a rehearing on proper notice and disclosure”: <i>Gratton-Masuy</i>, at paras. 36-40.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Second
    Review of the Authorizations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2002, following the Divisional Court’s decision, the
    Commission commenced a second review of the Authorizations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their factum on appeal, the appellants assert that the Commission
    failed to disclose any facts, evidence or allegations leading to “its decision
    to re-open the Appellants’ Authorizations”.  The respondents disagree.  They argue
    that the Com-mission provided the appellants with a “Notice and Disclosure”
    package on November 11, 2002 that included details of the Commission’s concerns
    about the appellants’ sewage treatment systems.  In their pleading in the litigation
    that eventually ensued between the parties, which I discuss later in these
    reasons, the appellants reference and acknowledge their receipt of the
    Commission’s Notice and Disclosure package.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 27, 2003, the appellants proposed a joint working group
    process to address the Commission’s concerns regarding the Authorizations.  The
    Commission appointed eight of its members as an <i>ad hoc</i> subcommittee to
    meet with the appellants to discuss technical issues relating to the Authorizations
    and to prepare a report for the full Commission (the “Subcommittee”).  As
    relevant to this appeal, five of the individual respondents were members of the
    Subcommittee: Gregory Ford, Douglas Joy, Donald J. Morton, Rashmi Nathwani and
    James Wilkinson (collectively, the “Subcommittee Members”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants attended some of the Subcommittee’s numerous meetings and
    otherwise communicated in writing with the Commission or the Subcommittee.  In October
    2003, the appellants made a three-day presentation to the Subcommittee
    regarding the functioning, safety and efficacy of their sewage treatment
    systems.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants allege that, contrary to the Commission’s assurances to them,
    the Subcommittee Members failed to engage in direct dialogue with them on the
    “science-related” issues raised in their presentation.  They say that this
    failure constituted “bad faith” by the Subcommittee Members, “consistent with
    their malicious and undisclosed intention of achieving the [Commission’s] pre-determined
    outcome”, that is, amendments to the Authorizations.  The appellants further
    claim that they understood that any draft report by the Subcommittee concerning
    the Authorizations would be submitted to the full Commission only with the
    appellants’ prior consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late November or early December 2004, the Subcommittee sent the
    appellants a draft report regarding the Authorizations and invited them to a
    meeting to discuss the draft before it was finalized.  The appellants objected to
    the report and its proposed submission to the Commission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their factum on appeal, the respondents maintain that the draft
    report included “an overview of the [Commission’s] stated health and safety
    concerns [regarding the Authorizations], an outline of the [appellants’]
    submissions to the Subcommittee, the Subcommittee’s analysis and the
    conclusions and proposed recommendations for the [Commission]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the appellants claim that they had no input into the draft
    report and that their “uncontradicted scientific evidence” regarding their
    sewage treatment systems – proffered during their October 2003 presentation to
    the Subcommittee – was “ignored without explanation and with no indication of
    what additional information would be required”.  The appellants also maintain
    that in delivering the draft report, the Sub-committee informed them for the
    first time that the report would be “confirmed” regardless of the appellants’
    objections.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Subcommittee submitted its final report to the full Commission on
    October 25, 2005 (the “Subcommittee Report”).  On November 11, 2005, it provided
    a copy to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early June 2006, the Commission informed the appellants that it was
    considering amendments to the Authorizations.  The Commission provided the
    appellants with a copy of the proposed amendments, and invited them to a
    meeting to discuss their content.  The appellants declined this invitation.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(5)       The
    Litigation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 24, 2006, before any amendments to the Authorizations were made,
    the appellants brought an action against the Commission, 19 Commission members –
    including the Subcommittee Members – and the Crown.  In their pleading, the
    appellants claim: (1) declaratory relief quashing certain resolutions of the
    Commission relating to the Authorizations on the grounds that the Commission
    allegedly exceeded its jurisdiction, acted in breach of the terms on which the
    appellants agreed to meet with the Subcommittee, and acted for improper
    purposes in initiating and continuing the 2001 and 2002 reviews of the
    Authorizations; (2) injunctive relief prohibiting the Commission from acting on
    the Subcommittee Report or “proceed[ing] against the Authorizations” pending
    the final disposition of the action; and (3) as against the individual respondents
    and the Crown, general, special and punitive damages in the approximate amount
    of $8.25 million for alleged misfeasance in public office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellants’ claim: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (1)  after the grant of
    the Authorizations, the Com-mission engaged in a process “aimed at achieving
    the ulterior and improper purpose of bringing the [Author-izations] back into
    line” with authorizations issued by the Commission to third parties (para. 32
    of the claim);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)    throughout its
    review process, the Commission was “motivated by bad faith and ulterior motive”
    and reflected a “pre-determined agenda of amending the Authorizations”;
    further, the Commission engaged in “an unwarranted and targeted attack” on the
    appellants that was motivated by bad faith and ulterior motive and that lacked
    any “foundation in fact or in science” (para. 33 of the claim); </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)  neither the
    Commission nor any of its members “reached or held the honest belief” that “a
    valid health and safety concern” or “a potential danger to the public” exists
    that would warrant amendment of the Authorizations (paras. 36 and 47 of the
    claim); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)    the Commission
    and the individual respondents “directed an attack on the [appellants] with the
    malicious intention of defeating those provisions in the Authorizations which …
    provide to the [appellants] a commercial advantage”; further, the individual
    res-pondents were “improperly motivated to ‘level the field’ ” and “by the
    desire to win what they perceived to be a war against the [appellants]”, with
    the know-ledge that it would result in injury to the appellants “in the form of
    lost market share and disruption of their activities” (paras. 37-38 and 41 of
    the claim).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants further allege that the Subcommittee Members deliberately
    and improperly used their office as members of the Commission.  In their
    statement of claim, the appellants plead: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> a lack of transparency in the Commission’s review process, including in
    the Subcommittee’s work (paras. 42-45 of the claim);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an absence of any basis in fact or science and of any honestly held
    belief that the Authorizations gave rise to an existing or potential health and
    safety concern, warranting review of the Authorizations (paras. 33, 36-38, 39-41
    and 46-48 of the claim);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the breach of the terms of the working group process regarding the
    Authorizations (paras. 60-67 of the claim);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a lack of independent decision-making by the indiv-idual Subcommittee
    Members (paras. 68-70 of the claim); and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a series of individual acts of bias, malice or conflict of interest by
    each of the Subcommittee Members (paras. 45 and 69-88 of the claim).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(6)       Defence
    Response to the Appellants’ Pleading</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents did not deliver a statement of defence.  Instead, they
    moved under rule 21.01(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194 (the “Rules”) for an order dismissing the action or, in the
    alternative, for an order under rule 21.01(1)(b) striking the statement of
    claim in its entirety.  They argued that: (1) the Commission lacked the legal capacity
    to be sued; (2) the court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
    appellants’ action; (3) the matters complained of were subject to the doctrine
    of <i>res judicata</i> or otherwise constituted an abuse of process; and (4)
    the appellants’ pleading disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several documents mentioned in the appellants’ statement of claim were
    filed by the respondents on their Rule 21 motion, including the Commission’s
    Notice and Disclosure package and the Subcommittee Report.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated May 29, 2007, Roy J. of the Superior Court of Justice
    granted the respondents’ motion in part.  He struck the appellants’ claims as
    against the individual respondents except for the Subcommittee Members and dismissed
    the motion in all other respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In so doing, the motion judge held that: (1) the Commission was a
    necessary party to the appellants’ action and its inclusion as a named party
    defendant was consistent with the applicable statutes and jurisprudence; (2)
    the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action since part of
    the relief claimed was “outside the mandate of the Divisional Court” on a
    judicial review application and was consistent with the provisions of s. 8 of
    the <i>Judicial Review Procedure Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1 (the “<i>JRPA</i>”);
    (3) the necessary prerequisites for the application of <i>res judicata</i> or
    abuse of process had not been made out; (4) the appellants’ pleading “failed to
    provide the circumstances, particulars or facts” against 14 of the 19
    individual respondents “which would allow the trier of fact to properly infer
    intention or malicious conduct” against them; and (5) in respect of the
    Subcommittee Members, it would “be up to the trier of fact to determine whether
    the allegations and particulars support malice”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal by the respondents from the motion judge’s order, the
    Divisional Court ruled that the Commission is not a suable entity and that the
    appropriate remedy against the Commission for an aggrieved party is an
    application for judicial review.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court also held that the appellants’ pleading against the
    individual respondents had to be struck on two grounds.  First, given the
    appellants’ reliance on the tort of misfeasance in public office, the
    Divisional Court concluded that the motion judge had erred by deferring to the
    trial judge on the question of the adequacy of the appellants’ pleas of bad
    faith or malice.  In the Divisional Court’s opinion, the motion judge was
    obliged to analyze the sufficiency of the appellants’ pleading to determine if
    it was capable of supporting the appellants’ assertions of bad faith and malice
    by the Subcommittee Members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court therefore examined the appellants’ statement of
    claim and ruled, essentially, that it failed to conform to the rules of
    pleading and to disclose a reasonable cause of action against the Subcommittee
    Members:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the only substantial facts pleaded by
    the Respondents [against the Subcommittee Members] are assumptions and
    speculations about the motivations under-lying the conduct of the [Subcommittee
    Members].  It is not sufficient to state legal conclusions or the Respondents’
    belief in the motives of the individual Appellants.  Such statements are no
    more than bald assertions of bad faith or malice, and do not meet the high
    threshold required for pleadings of bad faith or malice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in the Divisional Court’s view, the appellants’ pleading against
    the Sub-committee Members also had to be struck in light of the immunity from
    suit provision set out in s. 31(1) of the Act.  In material part, s. 31(1)
    states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No action or other proceeding for damages shall be
    instituted against … a member of … the [Commission], or anyone acting under
    their authority … for any act done in good faith in the execution or intended
    execution of any power or duty under this Act or the regulations or for any
    alleged neglect or default in the execution in good faith of that power or
    duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Crown was sued in its representative capacity, the appellants
    properly acknowledged before the Divisional Court that if their claims against
    the Subcommittee Members fell, their claims against the Crown were similarly
    unsustainable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, by order dated June 11, 2009, the Divisional Court
    allowed the respondents’ appeal from the motion judge’s decision, dismissed the
    appellants’ action against the Commission, and struck the statement of claim as
    against the Subcommittee Members and the Crown. </p>

    based on the Commission’s alleged unlawful exercise of its statutory powers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span

    is a non-corporate statutory entity that does not have the legal capacity to be
    sued.  Consequently, the respondents submit, the Divisional Court correctly
    dismissed the appellants’ action against the Commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span

    incorporating them or by necessary implication liable to be sued in an action
    for damages, but who are legal entities in that their actions may be reviewed
    in proceedings brought against them by way of the extraordinary remedies of <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing the holding of this court in <i>Hollinger Bus Lines Ltd. v.
    Ontario Labour Relations Board</i>, [1952] 3 D.L.R. 162, that the Ontario
    Labour Relations Board was not a suable entity, Houlden J. held in <i>Westlake</i> at p. 539 that the Ontario Securities Com-mission was an entity coming within
    the sixth category of statutory entities above-described.  Consequently, while
    its actions were subject to judicial review in proceedings involving the
    prerogative writs, it could not be sued for damages in a civil action.  Houlden
    J.’s decision to dismiss the action on this basis was upheld unanimously both by
    this court and by the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hollinger</i>, Roach J.A. explained why the Ontario Labour
    Relations Board did not fit into any of the available categories of suable
    entities, and therefore could not be liable to an action for declaratory and
    injunctive relief.  His comments at paras. 12-15 are instructive:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Plainly, [the Board] is not an individual. There
    are individuals who are members of the Board but the Board itself is a single
    entity.  Plainly, too, the members of the Board are not partners or persons
    carrying on business in a name other than their own.  Neither is the defendant
    a corporation.  The statute creating it, most significantly, does not declare
    it to be a corporation.  There are Boards which are the creatures of the
    legislature, some of which, by the statutes creating them, are corporations,
    and some of which are not.  For example, the Workmen’s Compensation Board, by
    the statute creating it, is a body corporate; the Ontario Municipal Board is
    not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are cases in which it has been held that,
    notwithstanding the fact that the Act creating a body did not expressly declare
    it to be a body corporate, that body, as a necessary intendment from the
    enactment creating it, was liable to be sued and had capacity to sue. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Clearly, there is nothing in The Labour Relations
    Act, 1948, c. 51 [<i>sic</i>], which created this defendant, supporting any
    such implication.  Indeed, there are provisions in it which deny such an
    implication.  In particular, s. 5 of the Act … provides that: “Subject to such
    right of appeal as may be provided by the regulations, the orders, decisions
    and rulings of the Board shall be final and shall not be questioned or reviewed
    nor shall any proceeding before the Board be removed, nor shall the Board be
    restrained by injunction, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, certiorari or
    otherwise by any court, but the Board may, if it considers it advisable to do
    so, reconsider any decision or order made by it and may vary or revoke any such
    decision or order.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The whole scheme and purpose of the Act is to deal
    with certain phases of the employer-employee relationship.  The Board does not
    carry on any business.  Its function is primarily administrative and it has
    been given power to exercise certain functions of a judicial nature.  There is
    nothing the Act remotely suggesting that it was intended by the Legislature
    that the Board should have the capacity either to sue or to be sued.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>                        <i>(ii) 
         Application of the Westlake Test</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Divisional Court held that the motion judge, by finding
    that the Commission was a necessary party to the appellants’ action, implicitly
    accepted that the Commission was a suable entity “without performing the
    necessary analysis to determine its status at law”.  I agree.  In so doing, the
    motion judge erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court then expressly considered the <i>Westlake</i> test
    for the determination of a statutory entity’s liability to suit and concluded
    that the Commission, like the Ontario Securities Commission in <i>Westlake</i>,
    falls within that category of non-corporate statutory entities that are subject
    to proceedings brought against them by way of the extraordinary remedies, but that
    cannot be sued in an action.  For the following reasons, I again agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the Commission is a non-corporate entity and
    that it is not expressly liable to suit by the terms of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor, in my opinion, does the Act contain any indication of a legislative
    intent that legal capacity to be sued should be inferred in respect of the
    Commission.  Indeed, the provisions of the Act relating to the Commission
    significantly undercut this suggestion.  As the Divisional Court observed at
    para. 22 of its reasons, the narrow statutory powers and duties assigned to the
    Commission under s. 28(4) of the Act, above-quoted, do not include the power to
    contract, to acquire or hold property, or to engage in commercial activity or
    otherwise conduct business.  Such powers, if assigned to the Commission by the
    legislature, would support the conclusion that the Commission has the capacity
    to sue and to be sued: <i>Hollinger</i>; <i>Westlake</i>.  It follows that the
    absence of such statutory powers strongly favours the opposite conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, s. 31(1) of the Act does not contemplate a right to sue the
    Commission.  Section 31(1) applies to members of the Commission or anyone acting
    under their authority.  It provides those persons with immunity from a claim
    for damages absent a showing of bad faith.  It has no application to the
    Commission itself or even to claims against members of the Commission that do
    not involve a claim for damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, under the <i>Westlake</i> analytical framework, the Commission is
    not liable to suit for damages.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Declaratory
    and Injunctive Relief</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue, however, that <i>Westlake</i> has no application
    in this case as it involved a suit for damages against a statutory entity rather
    than claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, as sought in this case
    against the Commission.  They submit that so long as they do not claim damages
    against the Commission, declaratory and injunctive relief may be sought against
    it by way of action.  They further contend that even where, as here, part of
    the relief claimed against the Commission implicates relief afforded by the prerogative
    writs, the common law right of action for declaratory relief remains available. 
    I would not give effect to these arguments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Smith v. New Brunswick (Human Rights Commission)</i> (1997), 143
    D.L.R. (4th) 251, leave to appeal dismissed, [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 169, the New
    Brunswick Court of Appeal considered the viability of an action against the New
    Brunswick Human Rights Commission in which damages as well as declaratory, <i>Charter</i> and other relief were sought.  Writing for a unanimous court, Bastarache J.A.,
    as he then was, applied <i>Westlake</i>, observing that it “has been followed
    consistently” (at p. 254).  He concluded that the Human Rights Commission, as a
    statutory body exercising quasi-judicial functions, was “clearly not a suable
    entity” (at p. 257) and stated at pp. 256-57:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[C]ounsel for the Commission drew a distinction
    between claims seeking civil remedies against the Commission, and claims that
    are aimed at reviewing the decisions of the Commission because it acted without
    jurisdiction or lost jurisdiction because of the manner in which it acted. 
    This raises the question of the appropriateness of striking out the portion of
    the Statement of Claim whereby Mr. Smith seeks a declaration that the
    affirmative action program instituted by the University of New Brunswick, and
    approved by the Commission, is of no force and effect, and that the
    Commission’s decisions dismissing his complaints are of no force and effect. 
    Stated differently, the question is whether Mr. Smith can avoid the application
    of Rule 69 of the Rules of Court<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> by asking for a declaration in the context of an action.  I agree with the
    position taken by Jones and de Villars who have addressed this question at pp.
    555-56 of their above-mentioned book [<i>Principles of Administrative Law</i>,
    2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1994)].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Given the flexible nature of the declaration,
    there are few limitations on its availability.  <i>When proceedings for a
    declaration are brought by way of action, the statutory body must have
    sufficient legal personality to be sued in its own right.  For example, in </i>B.
    v. Department of Manpower and Immigration, Commissioners of Inquiry, <i>(1975)
    60 B.L.R</i>. <i>(3d) 339 (Fed. T.D.), the Federal Court held that</i> <i>a
    declaration is not available against a federal board or tribunal unless its
    enabling legislation expressly states that it is a suable entity.  Therefore a
    declaratory judgment is not available against such a delegate although it may
    be amenable to certiorari or prohibition.  </i>It is also generally agreed that
    a declaration is not available to correct an error of law or fact committed
    within a tribunal’s jurisdiction.  A declaration of invalidity cannot be
    granted by the court (unless any error was found to be patently unreasonable). 
    In such an event, the only effective remedy would be <i>certiorari</i> which
    enables the court to quash the decision of the tribunal when it is established
    that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction or erred in law within its
    jurisdiction.  Nor, it appears, could the Court grant a declaration as to the
    applicant’s rights in such a situation as the tribunal has made an ostensibly
    binding decision.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The New Brunswick Court of Appeal therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s
    action in its entirety, including his claims for declaratory relief.  In my
    view, the reasoning in <i>Smith</i> is apposite in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that <i>Hollinger</i> involved an action for declaratory and
    injunctive relief as against the Ontario Labour Relations Board, rather than an
    action for damages.  Nonetheless, as the Board was not a suable entity, this
    court held that the action could not proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellants urge an unduly restrictive interpretation of <i>Westlake</i>. 
    Nothing in <i>Westlake</i> suggests that the liability to suit of non-corporate
    statutory entities is augmented where declaratory or injunctive relief in the
    nature of <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i> or prohibition is claimed.  On the
    contrary, <i>Westlake</i> holds at p. 538 that the fact that the actions or
    proceedings of a statutory entity are subject to review by way of the
    extraordinary remedies does not mean that the same entity is legally capable of
    being sued in an action for damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, as the respondents point out, <i>Westlake</i> does not say that an <i>action</i> for the extraordinary remedies of <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i> or prohibition
    may be brought against non-corporate statutory entities.  Rather, it
    contemplates “proceedings” for such remedies.  Nor does <i>Westlake</i> stand
    for the proposition that where review of the conduct of a non-corporate
    statutory entity is available by way of an application for judicial review, an
    action for declaratory or injunctive relief against the same entity is also
    available.  Indeed, in my view, <i>Westlake</i> suggests to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early 1970s, legislative reform of judicial review was introduced
    in Ontario under the <i>JRPA</i>.  Under s. 2(1) of the <i>JRPA</i>, public and

    sought by the appellants against the various respondents.  For example, at
    para. 24 of its reasons, it observed that the relief claimed against the
    Commission excluded damages but included the extraordinary remedy of
    prohibition.  In fact, the relief claimed includes a prohibitory injunction,
    which is similar in effect to the writ of prohibition.  The Divisional Court
    concluded that relief in the nature of prohibition must be sought against the
    Commission by way of judicial review, rather than by way of action.  I agree.  This
    conclusion is entirely consistent with <i>Westlake</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, under s. 7 of the <i>JRPA</i>, an application for an order in
    the nature of <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition or <i>certiorari</i> is deemed to be
    an application for judicial review and “shall be made, treated and disposed of
    as if it were an application for judicial review”.  I note that the appellants
    were unable to point to any authority in which prohibition was sought against a
    statutory entity by way of action rather than judicial review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Historically, private law remedies were seen as distinct from the
    prerogative remedies when they were sought to be invoked concerning the
    exercise of powers subject to public law.  As Jones and de Villars comment in <i>Principles
    of Administrative Law</i>, 5th ed. <i>supra</i> at 640:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Certiorari</i> and prohibition are now used
    exclusively to control the exercise of statutory authority and are confined to
    the public law field.  They play no part in private law … On the other hand, a
    person may sometimes seek one of the private law remedies … in the context of
    an illegal governmental action, <i>instead of obtaining certiorari or
    prohibition</i>.  [Footnotes omitted; Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in the same text at pp. 755-57, Jones and de Villars emphasize
    that the use of the private law remedy of a declaration as a supervisory remedy
    in public law – a relatively recent development – is an alternative form of
    proceeding to an application for <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the advent of the <i>JRPA</i>, however, the adaptation of declaratory
    and injunctive relief as public law remedies was entrenched by statute.  Thus,
    under s. 2(1) of the <i>JRPA</i>, above-quoted, the court is empowered in the
    exercise of its discretion to grant such relief on a judicial review
    application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as I have said, the appellants seek both declaratory and
    injunctive relief against the Commission.  They argue that the common law right
    of action for such relief was not abrogated by the <i>JRPA</i> and, further, that
    the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Justice under the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the “<i>CJA</i>”) to grant declaratory
    relief extends to the acts or omissions of both the Crown and statutory bodies
    like the Commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that under the <i>PACA</i>, declaratory, although
    not injunctive, relief is available in a proceeding against the Crown in
    respect of the rights of the parties.  Further, the Ontario Superior Court’s jurisdiction
    pursuant to ss. 11(2) and 97 of the <i>CJA</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> to make “binding declarations of right” and to exercise the jurisdiction, power
    and authority historically exercised by courts of common law and equity in
    England and Ontario is beyond controversy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But this does not mean that the Superior Court’s jurisdiction to grant
    declaratory relief can be invoked in an action against a defendant that does
    not have the legal capacity to be sued in its own right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is authority for the proposition that the <i>JRPA</i> does not
    preclude an action for a declaration in relation to the exercise of a statutory
    power: see for example, <i>Campbell Soup Co. v. Ontario (Farm Products
    Marketing Board)</i> (1975), 10 O.R. (2d) 405 (S.C.), at para. 115, aff’d
    (1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 256 (C.A.).  Indeed, as the motion judge noted in this
    case, s. 8 of the <i>JRPA</i>, which authorizes the summary disposition of an
    action for a declaration or injunction as if it were an application for
    judicial review in certain circumstances, recognizes that such an action may be
    brought: <i>Campbell Soup</i>, at para. 115.  Furthermore, s. 2(1) of the <i>JRPA</i> does not say that the grant of a declaration or an injunction in respect of
    administrative action may only be obtained pursuant to the <i>JRPA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet nothing in <i>Campbell Soup</i> or the <i>JRPA</i> derogates from
    the central principle that suability is a prerequisite to the court’s
    jurisdiction to entertain the claims advanced by a plaintiff against a
    defendant.  As the New Brunswick Court of Appeal said in <i>Smith</i> at p.&nbsp;256
    in the context of <i>Charter</i> claims, “[I]n all cases, the Court must have
    jurisdiction over the party being sued before it can deal with the claim being
    made.  The test in <i>Westlake</i> is applicable to determine this issue.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same point is made by J. M. Evans and D. J. M. Brown in <i>Judicial
    Review of Administrative Action in Canada</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Canvasback
    Publishing, 1998), at 1:8200, note 470: “[A]n injunction may not issue against
    a tribunal or other administrative body <i>eo nomine</i> [by or in that name]
    that is not a suable entity.”  The authors elaborate at 4:2400:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unless they are incorporated or their constitutive
    statute provides otherwise expressly or by implication, independent
    administrative agencies are not legal entities.  However, as with other
    unincorporated entities, there are legislative provisions enabling them to be
    made respondents in those jurisdictions where the law of judicial review has
    been reformed.  For example, Ontario’s [<i>JRPA</i>] provides that for the
    purpose of an application for judicial review in relation to the exercise or
    non-exercise of a statutory power, “the person who is authorized to exercise
    the power may be a party” [s. 9(2) of the <i>JRPA</i>], and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>any two or more
    persons who, acting together, may exercise a statutory power, whether styled a
    board or commission or by any other collective title, shall be deemed to be a
    person under such collective title [s. 9(3) of the <i>JRPA</i>].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Footnotes omitted.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely especially on <i>Bingo Enterprises Ltd. v. Manitoba (Lotteries
    and Gaming Licensing Board)</i>, [1983] 23 Man. R. (2d) 33 (Man. C.A.) and <i>Seaway
    Trust Co. v. Ontario</i> (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 501 (Div. Ct.), rev’d (1983), 41
    O.R. (2d) 532 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1983] S.C.C.A. No. 127, to
    contend that the Commission is liable to suit for declaratory and injunctive
    relief notwithstanding the provisions of the <i>JRPA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These cases do not assist the appellants.  In <i>Bingo Enterprises</i>,
    the court relied on <i>Westlake</i> to strike a statement of claim in which
    damages and injunctive relief were sought against a non-corporate statutory
    entity on the ground that the entity in question lacked suable status.  However,
    the court held that <i>an originating notice of motion</i>, in which
    declaratory relief was claimed against the same entity, was an acceptable
    alternative to a claim for <i>mandamus</i>.  Thus, while the court recognized
    that declaratory relief could be sought against the relevant entity, recovery of
    that relief by way of action was not permitted and an originating notice was
    held to be the appropriate procedure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the decision of this court in <i>Seaway Trust</i>, that case
    involved an application by the Attorney-General of Ontario and others to quash
    two applications for judicial review regarding the validity of legislation
    enacted by the Government of Ontario that permitted the seizure and control of
    a trust company’s property, without a hearing, in certain circumstances.  Both
    applications sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including <i>Charter</i>-based
    relief and, in one application, damages were sought for property wrongfully
    seized.  The Attorney argued that the applications as constituted sought relief
    available by way of action and not available by way of application to the
    Divisional Court.  In other words, unlike this case, the Attorney sought to
    compel an action and to prevent judicial review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A majority of the Divisional Court in <i>Seaway Trust</i> dismissed the
    Attorney’s application.  However, in dissent, Craig J. held that the Attorney’s
    application should be granted and the judicial review applications quashed
    since all the relief claimed could be sought in an action, whereas part of the
    relief – for example, the determination of liability and the assessment of
    damages – was not available in the Divisional Court.  In Craig J.’s opinion, in
    these circumstances, it was inappropriate to allow the judicial review
    applicants to “split their cases and dispose of the issues piecemeal” (at p.
    532).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appeal to this court was allowed, essentially for the reasons of
    Craig J.: (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 532.  However, in allowing the appeal, this
    court emphasized at p. 533 the “highly unusual”, indeed “unique”, factual
    circumstances of the case and further commented, “[A] wide variety of diverse
    and compelling interests are involved. … an extensive review of evidence will
    be required before a conclusion can be reached regarding the validity of the
    impugned legislation.  Findings of fact based upon assessments of credibility
    will have to be made.”  All these compelling factors favoured resort to trial, rather
    than to the judicial review process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given its “highly unusual” and “unique” facts, I do not regard <i>Seaway
    Trust</i> as establishing any general principle that relief otherwise available
    on judicial review may be sought alternatively by way of action.  Nor, in my
    view, should <i>Seaway Trust</i> be viewed as a precedent for such a principle
    in circumstances where the relief claimed against one defendant is within the
    jurisdiction of the Divisional Court, while some or all the relief claimed
    against other defendants is not.  More importantly, the named respondents in
    the judicial review applications at issue in <i>Seaway Trust</i> and, thus, the
    proposed defendants in the action urged by the Attorney in that case, were all
    suable entities.  As a result, unlike this case, no question regarding the
    court’s jurisdiction over the person of the respondents or proposed defendants arose
    in <i>Seaway Trust</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that the other Ontario authorities relied on by the appellants
    involve either corporate or non-corporate defendants who meet the <i>Westlake</i> test for suability, including the Crown, or applications under s. 8 of the <i>JRPA</i>.<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(iv)      Additional
    Considerations</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two final considerations deserve mention.  First, as I have indicated, the
    respon-dents’ motion for an order dismissing the action as against the
    Commission was brought in part under rule 21.01(3)(b).  That rule permits a
    defendant to move before a judge to have an action stayed or dismissed
    summarily on the ground that the defendant does not have the legal capacity to
    be sued.  Rule 21.01(3)(b) thus envisages that an action cannot be brought
    against a non-suable entity regardless of the claims advanced and the relief
    sought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, neither before this court nor in the proceedings below did the
    respondents challenge the action on the basis that it was a collateral attack
    on the Commission’s announced intention to amend the Authorizations.  Presumably
    this is because: (1) the appellants do not seek a money remedy against the
    Commission; (2) the Authorizations had not been amended prior to the
    commencement of the litigation between the parties; and (3) this court has held
    that a collateral attack argument is a defence and does not go to jurisdiction: <i>TeleZone Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 303 D.L.R. (4th) 626, at
    paras. 97 and 111, leave to appeal granted, [2009] S.C.C.A. No. 77.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in their pleading, the appellants seek a declaration concerning
    the  legal validity of various resolutions made by the Commission in connection
    with the Authorizations.  They also seek a declaration regarding the
    Commission’s authority to proceed against the Authorizations.  The appellants’
    factum on appeal states that, “As against the Commission, the action seeks …
    declaratory relief quashing resolutions of the [Commission] on grounds that it
    exceeded its jurisdiction and acted in breach of an agreement and for improper
    purposes.”  Thus, the appellants attack certain “decisions” of the Commission –
    the identified Commission resolutions – as well as the lawfulness of the proposed
    amendments to the Authorizations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a collateral attack case in the sense of a challenge to a
    decision through subsequent independent proceedings.  Rather, the attack on the
    Commission’s resolutions and authority is made in a proceeding whose specific
    object is to disturb the administrative decisions at issue: see <i>TeleZone Inc.</i>,
    at paras. 97-98 and 111.  That said, from a generalized perspective, the
    principles regulating collateral attack on an administrative decision support
    the conclusion that the appellants should pursue their challenge to the
    Commission’s actions by way of the available alternative procedure afforded by the <i>JRPA</i>.  Under that procedure, the appellants are free to pursue all the
    categories of relief sought against the Commission – damages not being claimed
    – and to obtain a remedy that is responsive to the claims advanced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I conclude that none of the categories of relief claimed against the
    Commission may be pursued in an action where, as here, the named defendant is a
    non-suable entity.  Under the principles established in<i> Hollinger</i>,<i> Westlake</i> and<i> Smith</i>, the Commission is such an entity.  I am therefore satisfied
    that the appellants’ action against the Commission was properly dismissed.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(v)       Alternative
    Procedures</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, however, argue that two alternative procedures are
    available for the pursuit of their claims against the Commission.  They submit
    that if the Commission is not a suable entity in its own right for the purpose
    of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief, the relief sought against the
    Commission may be obtained against the Crown, which is already a named
    defendant in the appellants’ action.  In the further alternative, they argue
    that if the Crown is not directly answerable for the Commission’s actions, the
    Divisional Court erred by failing to consider and permit the addition of the
    Attorney-General for Ontario as a party defendant in substitution for the
    Commission in accordance with <i>Dyson v. Attorney-General</i>, [1911] 1 K.B.
    410 (Eng. &amp; Wales C.A.) (the “<i>Dyson </i>procedure”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accede to these arguments in this case.  Before the
    Divisional Court, the appellants acknowledged that pursuant to ss. 5(2) and
    5(4) of the <i>PACA</i>,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> if the individual respondents are not liable for the matters alleged against
    them, the Crown is similarly not liable.  I agree.  As I will explain later in
    these reasons, it is my opinion that the appellants’ statement of claim does
    not disclose a reasonable cause of action against the Subcommittee Members.  It
    is not alleged that the motion judge erred by striking the statement of claim
    against the remaining 14 individual respondents.  Accordingly, the appellants’
    action as framed cannot proceed as against the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, it is inappropriate in this case to permit the appellants to
    now resort to the <i>Dyson</i> procedure.  We were informed that in neither proceeding
    below did the appellants seek to amend their pleading to add the Attorney-General
    for Ontario as a defendant.  Rather, they invoke the <i>Dyson</i> procedure for
    the first time on this appeal.  Importantly, the appellants have pointed to no
    case in which the <i>Dyson </i>procedure has been employed absent a challenge
    to the validity or applicability of legislation.  No challenge of this kind is brought
    in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal in respect of the appellants’
    claims against the Commission.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It remains to be considered whether the Divisional Court erred by
    striking the appellants’ statement of claim against the Subcommittee Members
    and the Crown.  I make the following comments at the outset.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(i)</span></i><i><span lang=EN-US>        Tort of Misfeasance in
    Public Office</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, all the appellants’ pleas against the Subcommittee Members relate
    to their alleged failure to execute their duties properly and in good faith as
    members of the Commission.  They invoke, therefore, the tort of misfeasance in
    public office.  The constituent elements of this tort are well-established.  In
    the leading case of <i>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at
    paras. 22-23, Iacobucci J., writing for a unanimous court, described these
    elements as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What then are the essential ingredients of the
    tort, at least insofar as it is necessary to determine the issues that arise on
    the pleadings in this case?  In <i>Three Rivers</i>, the House of Lords held
    that the tort of misfeasance in a public office can arise in one of two ways,
    what I shall call Category A and Category B.  Category A involves conduct that
    is specifically intended to injure a person or class of persons.  Category B
    involves a public officer who acts with knowledge both that she or he has no
    power to do the act complained of and that the act is likely to injure the
    plaintiff. … It is important, however, to recall that the two categories merely
    represent two different ways in which a public officer can commit the tort; in
    each instance, the plaintiff must prove each of the tort’s constituent
    elements.  It is thus necessary to consider the elements that are common to
    each form of the tort.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>In my view, there are two such elements.  First,
    the public officer must have engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct in his
    or her capacity as a public officer.  Second, the public officer must have been
    aware both that his or her conduct was unlawful and that it was likely to harm
    the plaintiff</i>.  What distinguishes one form of misfeasance in a public
    office from the other is the manner in which the plaintiff proves each
    ingredient of the tort.  In Category B, the plaintiff must prove the two
    ingredients of the tort independently of one another.  In Category A, the fact
    that the public officer has acted for the express purpose of harming the
    plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy each ingredient of the tort, owing to the
    fact that a public officer does not have the authority to exercise his or her
    powers for an improper purpose, such as deliberately harming a member of the
    public.  <i>In each instance, the tort involves deliberate disregard of
    official duty coupled with knowledge that the misconduct is likely to injure
    the plaintiff</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the Divisional Court erred in its appreciation
    of the requisite elements of the tort by proceeding on the basis that an
    express plea of actual malice, in the form of a specific intent to injure a
    person or class of persons, is a necessary element of the tort.  I would reject
    this argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Iacobucci J. explained in <i>Odhavji</i>, at para. 28, bad faith or
    dishonesty is an essential ingredient of the tort of misfeasance in public
    office.  Further, “In order for the conduct to fall within the scope of the
    tort, the officer must deliberately engage in conduct that he or she knows to
    be inconsistent with the obligations of the office.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the core of the appellants’ pleading against the
    Subcommittee Members consists of allegations of bad faith, actual malice and
    bias.  In these circum-stances, it was appropriate for the Divisional Court to
    address the sufficiency of the appellants’ pleading in light of the malice
    allegations actually advanced.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)</span></i><i><span lang=EN-US>       Bad Faith and Malice</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the immunity from suit provision embodied in s. 31(1) of the Act
    precludes any action or other proceeding for damages against the Subcommittee
    Members, as brought in this case, “for any act done in good faith in the
    execution or intended execution of any power or duty under [the] Act … or for
    any alleged neglect or default in the execution in good faith of that power or
    duty”.  Thus, to avoid the protective ambit of s. 31(1) of the Act, sufficient
    facts must be pleaded to support assertions of bad faith or malice against the
    Subcommittee Members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This requirement is enhanced by the rules of pleading in Ontario.  Under
    the <i>Rules</i>, every pleading must contain “a concise statement of the
    material facts on which the party relies for the claim”: rule 25.06(1). 
    Moreover, in cases involving allegations of malice or intent, as in this case, rule
    25.06(8) requires that “full particulars” be pleaded, although knowledge “may
    be alleged as a fact without pleading the circumstances from which it is to be
    inferred”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As malice is integral to the appellants’ claims against the Subcommittee
    Members, the appellants’ pleading must meet a stringent standard of
    particularity.  A bald plea of malice is insufficient to defeat a rule
    21.01(1)(b) motion.  Rouleau J., as he then was, put it this way in <i>Pispidikis
    v. Scroggie</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 596 (S.C.J.), at para. 36, aff’d (2003),
    68 O.R. (3d) 655 (C.A.): “There must be circumstances, particulars or facts
    from which a trier of fact will be able to infer or find malice.”  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the applicable test on a motion under rule 21.01(1)(b) to
    strike a pleading on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action
    was established in <i>Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc.</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959 at
    980, cited with approval in <i>Odhavji</i>, at para. 15.  Under this test,
    taking the facts pleaded in the statement of claim as true or reasonably
    capable of proof – although allegations of assumptions and speculation need not
    be accepted as such – it must be “plain and obvious” that the plaintiff’s
    pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action.  See also <i>Operation
    Dismantle v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at 455.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question in respect of the appellants’ pleas against the
    Subcommittee Members is therefore straightforward: is it plain and obvious that
    the appellants’ pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action against the
    Subcommittee Members given the claims asserted and the applicable rules of
    pleading?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants mount a two-part attack on the Divisional Court’s ruling
    that the statement of claim must be struck.  They argue first, that the
    Divisional Court erred by failing to consider the pleading as a whole, focusing
    instead on only those specific pleas of bad faith, malice and bias advanced against
    the Subcommittee Members at paragraphs 69-89 of the pleading.  Next, they submit
    that, contrary to the <i>Hunt</i> test, the Divisional Court erred by failing to
    accept the facts pleaded as true or as reasonably capable of proof.  Instead, the
    appellants contend, the Divisional Court improperly weighed the appellants’
    allegations against the Subcommittee Members on the merits.  I will consider
    each of these arguments in turn.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)</span></i><i><span lang=EN-US>      Consideration of the Pleading
    as a Whole</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that relief under rule 21.01(1)(b) could not be granted
    without scrutiny of the statement of claim as a whole.  It is also true that the
    Divisional Court addressed in detail only those specific allegations of
    improper conduct by the Subcommittee Members set out at paragraphs 69-89 of the
    appellant’s pleading.  That said, for the following reasons, I am not persuaded
    that the Divisional Court failed to consider the “overall picture” of the case
    pleaded against the Subcommittee Members.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in its reasons, the Divisional Court correctly recognized that
    the cause of action advanced by the appellants against the Subcommittee Members
    is the tort of misfeasance in public office.  That this is the sole cause of
    action asserted is apparent only on review of the pleading as a whole.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Divisional Court held that the motion judge had erred by
    ruling that the question of whether “the [pleaded] allegations and particulars
    support malice” was a matter for the trial judge to determine.   The court
    noted, again correctly, that the motion judge was obliged to analyze “the
    sufficiency of the pleadings to determine if they are capable of supporting
    allegations of bad faith or malice against the [Subcommittee Members]”.  This
    task necessarily requires an examination of the entire pleading at issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is implicit, therefore, that the Divisional Court scrutinized the appellants’
    entire pleading to assess whether it met the requisite threshold of
    particularity for pleas of malice and bad faith.  Given s. 31(1) of the Act and
    the requirements of rules 25.06(1) and 25.06(8), this is precisely what is
    mandated on a rule 21.01(1)(b) motion.  The Divisional Court set out clear and detailed
    reasons for its conclusion that the pleading suffered from fatal deficiencies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, by focusing in detail on the specific misconduct alleged against
    the Subcommittee Members, the Divisional Court sought to determine whether, on the
    view of the statement of claim most favourable to the appellants from the
    perspective of the rules of pleading, the applicable pleadings requirements had
    been met.  The Divisional Court did not err in so doing.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(v)</span></i><i><span lang=EN-US>       Application of the Hunt Test</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court’s reasons reveal that it was mindful of the
    requirement on a rule 21.01(1)(b) motion that the facts alleged in the impugned
    pleading must be taken as true or reasonably capable of proof.  At the outset
    of its analysis, the Divisional Court formulated the issues in this fashion:
    “Firstly, is the [Commission] a suable entity?  Secondly, are the facts pleaded
    in the Statement of Claim concerning the individual [members of the
    Commission], <i>if true or capable of proof</i>, sufficient to establish bad
    faith or malice at law?” (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in its reasons, the Divisional Court cited the following passage
    from <i>Region Plaza Inc. v. Hamilton-Wentworth (Regional Municipality)</i> (1990), 12 O.R. (3d) 750 (H.C.J.), at para. 4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On a motion under Rule 21, all allegations of fact
    in the Statement of Claim, unless blatantly ridiculous or incapable of proof,
    must be accepted as proven.  Allegations based on assumptions and speculations
    in the pleadings need not necessarily be taken as true.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court thus properly directed itself to the principles governing its
    review of the facts alleged in the statement of claim.  I see nothing in the Divisional
    Court’s reasons to suggest that it failed to properly apply those principles in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ real complaint is that the Divisional Court rejected their
    assertion that the pleas made against the Subcommittee Members, viewed as a
    whole, are sufficient to disclose a reasonable cause of action.  To repeat, the
    Divisional Court concluded that, “[T]he only substantial facts pleaded by the
    [appellants] are assumptions and speculations about the motivations underlying
    the conduct of the [Commission] subcommittee” and that the appellants’ asserted
    facts were nothing more than legal conclusions or bald assertions of bad faith
    or malice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree
    with this characterization of the relevant pleas in the appellants’ statement
    of claim.  For instance, in the general parts of the claim, no material facts
    are pleaded in support of the appellants’ assertions that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       the
    2001 Commission initiative to review the Authorizations was “known” to the
    Subcommittee Members “to be without foundation in fact or in science” and was
    “the opening phase of an unwar-ranted and targeted attack on the [appellants]”
    that was “motivated by bad faith and ulterior motive” (paras. 33, 40 and 46-47
    of the claim);  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       none
    of the Subcommittee Members at any time “reached or held the honest belief that
    a valid health and safety concern” or “a potential danger to the public” exists
    that would warrant amendment of the Authorizations (paras. 36 and 47 of the
    claim); </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       the
    Subcommittee Members were improperly moti-vated to “level the field” and “to
    win … a war against the [appellants]” (paras. 37 and 41 of the claim); </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       the
    sole and malicious purpose of the 2002 renewed review of the Authorizations was
    to wrongfully remove a commercial advantage from the appellants (paras. 37-38
    and 41 of the claim); and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)
          the Subcommittee Members had partial and pre-determined views and
    positioned themselves as adversaries of the appellants (para. 45 of the claim).  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The general allegations against the Subcommittee Members set
    out in the balance of the statement of claim suffer from the same deficiency.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the
    specific allegations of wrongdoing by the Subcommittee Members set out in paragraphs
    69-89 of the statement of claim, these are the pleas that were examined in
    detail by the Divisional Court and found to be lacking in sufficient
    particulars of material facts to satisfy the rules of pleading concerning
    claims of bad faith and malice.  I agree with the Divisional Court that these
    pleas reflect broadly cast allegations of bad faith, malice and bias based
    merely on assumptions and speculation about the motivations underlying the
    conduct of the Subcommittee Members.  Moreover, in some instances, as a matter
    of law, the alleged wrongful conduct does not support a plea of bad faith, malice
    or bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    examples will illustrate this point.  First, as against the respondent
    Nathwani, the appellants plead that he “intentionally promoted a culture of
    unanimity and silence in the public workings of the [Commission]” with “the
    malicious intention of targeting the [appellants] in order to defeat their
    legitimate interests through amendment of the Authorizations” (para. 69 of the
    claim).  No material facts in support of either assertion are pleaded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants plead that the respondent Joy, among other things, was
    disqualified from participating on the Subcommittee due to conflicts arising
    from his consultancy retainer by two competitors of the appellants, by his
    “lack of scientific objectivity” and by his “impermissible personal bias”
    against the appellants.  Various conduct by Joy is described as evidencing an
    intentional and malicious motive to “work against” the appellants in
    furtherance of his own interests (paras. 76-80 of the claim).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But no material
    facts are pleaded to support the assertions that Joy lacked scientific
    objectivity or had a personal bias against the appellants, apart from the fact
    that he had acted in the past as a paid consultant for two of the appellants’
    competitors.  No material facts are pleaded to support claims that the
    companies for whom Joy consulted stood to benefit from any amendments to the
    Authorizations or that Joy acted for his own profit and material interest: see <i>Energy
    Probe v. Canada (Atomic Energy Control Board) </i>(1984), 15 D.L.R. (4th) 48
    (F.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1984] S.C.C.A. No. 36.  Nor is it pleaded that
    Joy was on retainer to companies that stood to profit from amendments to the
    Authorizations at the time of the Subcommittee’s work.  The Divisional Court
    correctly noted that the bald allegation against Joy of a prior consulting
    arrangement with competitors of the appellants cannot constitute bad faith, malice
    or bias on his part.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the
    allegations against the respondents Ford and Wilkinson, in effect, are that
    they are in the same business as the appellants.  This, too, is insufficient to
    support a plea of bad faith, malice or bias.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commission’s
    membership includes various industry representatives, some of whom are
    contractors, designers, engineers or consultants.  In light of the Commission’s
    statutory mandate, described earlier in these reasons, its need for technical
    expertise is manifest.  I agree with the Divisional Court that the mere participation
    on the Commission of persons who are in the same industry as those who appear
    before the Commission, without more, cannot anchor a plea of bad faith, malice or
    bias.  As the Divisional Court observed, to hold otherwise would deprive the Commission
    of “members who possess the very skill and insight” on which the Commission
    depends for its work.  It would also undermine the concept of expert peer
    review.  Put another way, mere involvement in the same industry, without more,
    does not evidence partiality or bad faith, let alone malice.  See for example, <i>Pearlman
    v. Manitoba Law Society Judicial Committee</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 869.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that, read as a whole and taking the facts pleaded as true
    or reasonably capable of proof, it is plain and obvious that the appellants’
    statement of claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action against the
    Subcommittee Members.  In particular, in my view, it is plain and obvious that
    the facts pleaded by the appellants could not lead to a finding of bad faith or
    malice against the Subcommittee Members.  The pleading fails to set out the
    material facts required to support pleas of bad faith, malice and bias.  Absent
    those material facts, s. 31(1) of the Act bars the appellants’ action against
    the Subcommittee Members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    important to note that there is no suggestion that the appellants are in a
    position to allege further material facts known by them to be true which, if
    pleaded, could support the tort of misfeasance of public office against the
    Subcommittee Members.  See <i>Miguna v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (2005),
    262 D.L.R. (4th) 222 (Ont. C.A.).  The appellants did not seek a court order permitting
    them to deliver an amended statement of claim in respect of the Subcommittee
    Members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants submit that the Divisional Court struck their pleading, at least
    in part, after improperly weighing their allegations of bad faith, malice and
    bias against the Subcommittee Members on the merits.  In support of this
    submission, the appellants point to this statement in the Divisional Court’s
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Though
    the [appellants] are clearly disappointed with the [Commission’s] process and
    its outcome, this dissatisfaction is not grounds for legal recourse, provided
    that, as was the case here, procedural fairness, natural justice, and good
    faith on the part of the administrative decision-makers were present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the
    extent that this comment could be read as reflecting a finding by the
    Divisional Court that the Commission and the Subcommittee Members met their
    obligations to act fairly and in good faith, I agree with the appellants that
    such a finding was inappropriate on a rule 21.01(1)(b) motion.  See <i>Miguna
    v. Toronto Police Services Board</i>, 2008 ONCA 799, at paras. 16 and 34. 
    However, in my view, when the Divisional Court’s reasons are read as a whole,
    it is clear that this <i>obiter</i> comment, which appears at the end of the
    Divisional Court’s analysis, did not figure in that court’s central reasoning
    in respect of either issue on appeal.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Other Issues: Extrinsic Documents</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Generally,
    no evidence is admissible on a motion under rule 21.01(1)(b) to strike a
    pleading on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action: rule
    21.01(2)(b).  However, exceptionally, extrinsic evidence may be admitted on a
    rule 21.01(1)(b) motion where it is referenced in the plaintiff’s pleading and
    forms an integral part of the plaintiff’s claim.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    oral argument, an issue arose as to whether the respondents were entitled to
    rely on certain documents referenced in the statement of claim, which the
    respondents filed with the motion judge in support of their Rule 21 motion. 
    These included the Commission’s Notice and Disclosure package and the
    Subcommittee Report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    unclear whether the admission of the documents in question was challenged
    before the motion judge.  The record contains no ruling by the motion judge on
    the admissibility of the documents.  Nor was the admission of the documents
    raised as a ground of appeal on this appeal.  Moreover, neither the motion
    judge nor the Divisional Court relied on the documents in their reasons. 
    Nonetheless, as the appellants argued that the respondents’ reliance on these
    documents in their factum and during oral argument before this court took the
    appellants by surprise, we invited further written submissions from the parties
    on the significance, if any, of the documents to the issues on appeal.  We have
    received and considered those submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    opinion, nothing turns on this issue for the purpose of the disposition of this
    appeal.  The determination of the issues on appeal does not require reference
    to the impugned documents.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.      Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.  The appellants submit that
    no costs of the appeal should be awarded against them as the question of the
    Commission’s liability to suit is an issue of public importance.  I see no
    reason in this case to depart from the usual rule that costs follow the event. 
    I would award the respondents their costs of the appeal and the leave to appeal
    motion in this court, fixed in the total amount of $12,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and GST, as agreed by the parties.  </p>
