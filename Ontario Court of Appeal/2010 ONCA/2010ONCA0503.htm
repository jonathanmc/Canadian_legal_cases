lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that his convictions for
    assault causing bodily harm and fail to comply with probation were
    unreasonable, arguing that the Crown’s case rested on evidence from the
    complainant that was internally inconsistent, contradicted earlier statements
    and was embellished at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was alive to the inconsistencies
    in the complainant’s evidence and he accepted her explanation for lying to her
    roommate about her injuries and the damage to the washroom door. A trial judge
    is not required to deal with each and every inconsistency in a witness’
    evidence. We do not agree with the submission that the trial judge assessed
    credibility primarily based upon demeanour<b>.</b>  He gave careful and
    thoughtful reasons assessing the complainant’s evidence as a whole and accepted
    it as both credible and reliable beyond a reasonable doubt on the material
    facts – the nature of the assault and the identity of the assailant. We reject
    this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, we agree with the trial judge that
    this was a case of recognition rather than identity. The appellant had resided
    with the complainant for about two weeks before the assault. The trial judge
    noted that the complainant had not been cross-examined about her evidence that
    it was the appellant who had stayed with her in the apartment. In doing so, he
    did not effectively reverse the burden of proof on the issue of identity. He
    applied the correct legal principles and was satisfied that the appellant was
    the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the trial judge found beyond a
    reasonable doubt “that the injuries suffered by [the complainant] were serious
    and interfered with her health and comfort” and that “she continued to suffer
    tenderness in the area that was struck by the blow”.  He found the appellant
    guilty of assault causing bodily harm and, as a result, of failing to keep the
    peace and be of good behaviour.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made no error in principle and
    his findings of credibility are entitled to deference. There was no palpable or
    overriding error here. We are satisfied on the facts of this case that the
    verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could
    reasonably have rendered. The appeal from convictions is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor do we see any error in the sentence imposed.
    A two year sentence, after credit for presentence custody, was a fit sentence
    and warranted by the applicable sentencing principles. It was not a dramatic
    increase from that previously imposed for a similar offence such that it violated
    the ‘jump principle’.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is
    dismissed. </span></p>
