  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to set aside the trial judge’s order for ongoing
  support, arrears and costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent concedes that the trial judge referred to the wrong
    columns in the Child Support Guidelines and therefore made a calculation error
    in the support payment and arrears. The appellant agrees that $277 is the
    proper amount for ongoing support, subject to the continued eligibility of the
    older son.  The appellant will have to bring a motion in the Superior Court of
    Justice if he seeks to change the child support on the basis that the older son
    is now working full time and no longer in school. That issue was not before the
    trial judge and is not part of the decision appealed from.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that, apart from the calculation error, the trial judge
    did not err in principle in his approach to s. 8 of the Child Support
    Guidelines and the order should  be amended to reflect support in the amount of
    $277 per month.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant disputes the retroactive award by the trial judge. He
    takes the position that he has been supporting both children, including special
    expenses for the son living with his mother, the respondent. He submits that
    given the respondent’s household income, a retroactive award will unfairly
    create hardship for the younger son living with him as he will not be able to maintain
    the car payments or his son’s cell phone. The appellant did not give evidence
    at trial, although he was represented by counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evidence before him, the trial judge was entitled to make an
    order for support payments effective as of the date of the application, August
    8, 2008. The trial judge made the award retroactive to July 7, 2007, the date
    on which one of the sons moved to live with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the support award retroactive from August 5, 2008 to
    July 7, 2007, the trial judge considered only the conduct of the appellant. He
    did not consider the other factors articulated by the Supreme Court for
    determining retroactive support  in <i>D.B.S. v S.R.G.</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R.
    231: (1) unreasonably delay by the recipient parent in applying for the
    retroactive support; (2) conduct of the payor spouse; (3) circumstances of the
    child; and (4) hardship occasioned by the retroactive award.  Furthermore, it
    appears that he did not impute income to the respondent during this period,
    although he found it was appropriate to impute income to her and did so for
    subsequent periods.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order below is set aside and a new order shall issue for ongoing
    support of $277 per month effective August 5, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that success below was divided, the respondent’s costs at trial
    should be reduced to $8,000. The appellant has been substantially successful on
    appeal and the respondent’s concession was made at the last moment. The
    appellant shall have costs of $4,000 on the appeal.</p>
