  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a Rule 21 motion, the motion judge struck out those
    portions of the appellants’ statement of claim that were based on a claim that
    the respondent bank owed a duty to the appellants, who were not its customers.  The alleged duty was to make inquiries into
    the activities of its customer with whom the appellants had dealings in order to
    ensure that its customer was not using the bank to further fraudulent activity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge gave extensive reasons in which he
    analyzed the current law as well as whether this was a situation in which a new
    duty of care should be recognized pursuant to the principles from the <i>Anns/Kamloops</i> cases.  He concluded that the bank has a duty to a
    non-customer only where it has actual knowledge (including wilful blindness or
    recklessness) of its customer’s fraudulent conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for both parties presented very effective
    arguments; however, we are able to dispose of this appeal by way of this brief
    endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general terms, the struck portions of the statement
    of claim allege that in opening its customer’s accounts, the respondent owed a
    duty to the appellants, who were not customers of the bank, to ensure that the
    accounts would not be used for an unlawful purpose.  Further, the struck portions of the statement
    of claim allege that the bank owed a duty to the appellants to inquire into its
    customer’s activities because it ought to have known that those activities were
    suspicious, unusual, or fraudulent in nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are of the view that the facts, as pleaded, do not
    give arise to the duties relied upon in the struck portions of the statement of
    claim.  Although in some cases trial
    courts have, on motion to strike, allowed claims alleging a duty to ensure that
    a bank’s customers did not use their accounts for fraudulent purposes to
    proceed to trial, we were not referred to any trial or appellate decision in
    Canada holding that a bank has those duties to a non-customer.  Thus the impugned claims do not fall within a
    category of cases that has been recognized by the courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we do not consider this to be a case where
    this court should recognize a new duty of care under the <i>Anns</i>/<i>Kamloops</i> principles.  We agree generally with the
    motion judge’s analysis of those principles.  Based on that analysis, we are of the view that the facts, as pleaded in
    this case, are not sufficient to warrant recognizing a new duty of care by a
    bank to a non-customer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely on <i>Semac Industries Ltd. v. 1131426 Ontario Ltd.</i> (2001), 16 B.L.R.
    (3d) 88 (Ont. S.C.) to support the position that the struck portions of this claim
    should proceed to trial so that the question as to whether the court should
    recognize a duty be decided with the benefit of a full evidentiary record. In <i>Semac</i> the motion judge identified
    particular circumstances of the claim that, in his view, ought to be dealt with
    at a trial. These included allegations that the bank had already raised
    concerns internally about suspicious conduct on the part of its customer, and
    that the non-customer had subsequently alerted the bank to its allegation of
    fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No such allegations were pleaded in the appellants’
    statement of claim and in our view, there are no circumstances disclosed in the
    claim that warrant the issue going to trial. We would, therefore, not give
    effect to this submission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, we do not find it necessary to
    decide whether a bank may ever be found to have a duty to a non-customer in
    circumstances where it does not have actual knowledge (wilful blindness or recklessness)
    of the fraudulent activities being conducted through an account of its
    customer.  We leave the question of
    whether such a duty exists and, if so, in what circumstances, to another day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, we are of the view that it is plain and obvious
    that the claims made in the struck portions of the statement of claim cannot
    succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.  Costs are awarded to the respondent fixed in
    the agreed-upon amount of $29,700, inclusive of applicable GST, HST and
    disbursements.</p>
