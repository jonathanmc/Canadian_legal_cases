    team to carry out the search. Charges were laid against the respondents in
    February and July 1999, but they were eventually stayed based on this Court’s decision

    of the <i>Charter</i>, the trial judge concluded
    that the warrants to search the respondents’ premises should be set aside because
    the “lack of candour” of the police officer affiant in the information to

    had an obligation to &quot;include in [the] information [to obtain] a clear

    state of the law concerning whether ss. 9(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) and 10(1)(b)

    termination” of the respondents’ business.</span></p>

    wrong and taint his findings concerning the conduct of the appellants. That, in

    and 10(1)(b) of the <i>Act</i> make it an
    offence to decode encrypted signals without authorization, no matter where the
    signals emanate from and whether there is a lawful distributor in Canada. As a
    result of this decision, it is essentially undisputed that about 97% of the
    business carried on by the respondents on November 24, 1998 (the date on which
    the initial search warrants were obtained and executed) is, and always was,
    illegal. </span></p>

    conflicting decisions in other provinces concerning whether the provisions in
    issue applied to foreign signals for which there was no lawful Canadian
    distributor, there were no decisions on point in Ontario at the time. Moreover,
    the only appellate decision in Canada conclusively interpreting the relevant
    sections was a decision from the Federal Court of Appeal (though it, like <i>Bell ExpressVu</i>, was a civil case), which
    effectively held that s. 9(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the <i>Act</i> applies to encrypted signals coming
    from the United States, regardless of whether there are lawful distributors in
    Canada: <i>ExpressVu Inc. v. NII Norsat

    10(1)(b) of the <i>Act </i>applied to
    foreign signals where there is no lawful distributor in Canada. Accordingly,
    there was no Ontario authority on point at the time, let alone conflicting
    authority. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the police officer affiant
    of the information to obtain had no duty to disclose conflicting case law from
    outside the province that was not binding in Ontario.</span></p>

    statement in issue relates to the wording of the s. 9(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)
    itself. Although we agree that it was not the role of the affiant officer to
    express an opinion about the clarity of the section, we see no basis for

    sections in issue created an offence on these facts at the time the search
    warrants were issued and the only appellate court that had definitively
    interpreted the sections held that the sections indeed created an offence in
    these circumstances. Moreover, it is undisputed that approximately 97% of the
    respondents’ business involved the sale of satellite equipment, software and
    related material, which, on the authority of the <i>NII Norsat</i> decision, was illegal. We note as well that the
    respondents did not avail themselves of the procedure under s. 490 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for obtaining the return
    of the seized goods pending trial.</span></p>

    that he acted without good faith. Nor can his statement that s. 9(1<span

    a finding. Contrary to the trial judge’s conclusion, the officer’s statement
    was an opinion about the clarity of the section and not a misrepresentation

    the Justice of the Peace.</span></p>

    Given this finding and our conclusions that the police did not have an obligation
    to disclose conflicting case law or to consider alternatives to a search
    warrant, we see no basis for the finding of malice. The fact that a consequence
    of police conduct may be to shut down a business does not support a finding of

    authorizing judge could have issued the warrant: see <i>R. v. Araujo</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992 at paras. 51-59. Rather, he adopts
    the language of Romilly J. in <i>R. v. Maton</i> (2005),<i> </i>133 C.R.R. (2d) 72
    (B.C.S.C.), at para. 22, concluding that the “lack of candour” by the police
    officer affiant of the information to obtain “was so subversive of the prior

    the process and the preventive function it serves.”</span></p>

    a search warrant where the affiant is shown to have deliberately given false
    material statements or deliberately omitted material facts from an information
    to obtain with the intention of misleading a justice of the peace, the threshold
    for setting aside a search warrant in such circumstances is high: see <i>R v. Morris </i>(1998), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 539
    (N.S.C.A.), at paras. 42-43, quoted with approval in <i>Araujo</i>, at para. 54:</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US
style='color:black;'>This does not mean that errors, particularly
    deliberate ones, are irrelevant in the review process. While not leading to
    automatic vitiation of the warrant, there remains the need to protect the prior
    authorization process. The cases just referred to do not foreclose a reviewing
    judge, in appropriate circumstances, from concluding on the totality of the
    circumstances that the conduct of the police in seeking prior authorization was
    so subversive of that process that the resulting warrant must be set aside to
    protect the process and the preventive function it serves.</span></p>

    about some aspects of the police officer affiant’s credibility at trial (for
    example, in relation to his testimony concerning whether he read the relevant
    case law before applying for the search), once the trial judge’s core findings
    concerning absence of good faith and malice are set aside, this is simply not a

    satellite signals, and the basis for asserting that those mechanisms are
    illegal. They allege that the officer copied many of the statements in issue
    from Crown pleadings in a civil action against the government without any knowledge

    the Federal Court of Appeal decision, and the pleadings in a civil action in
    which a satellite subscription retailer was seeking an injunction against the
    government. Although the officer’s reference at trial to “an agreed statement”
    of fact may have been inaccurate, based on our review of the record, we are not
    persuaded that the respondents demonstrated that the police officer affiant
    lacked knowledge of any portion of the background information that was material
