  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff Bonita Maher was with her son Michael
    when she slipped and fell at an A&amp;P grocery store after the floor cleaning
    machine had passed by. The plaintiffs’ action against A&amp;P and the cleaning
    companies was tried by a jury, while the contractual <span class=SpellE>crossclaims</span> were tried later by the judge alone<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>.
    The jury found no negligence by any of the defendants and no contributory
    negligence by the plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The morning after the jury had rendered its verdicts
    and had been discharged by the <span class=GramE>judge,</span> all six members
    of the jury returned to the courthouse and lined up at the jury room door. When
    asked by court staff what they were doing there, one answered that they were
    there to count or calculate the money. When told that they had returned a no
    liability verdict and that the plaintiff would receive no money, it was
    reported that they looked stunned. Some also said they were there for a letter
    to their employers and one said that they were told to return. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing was done that day, as neither the judge nor the
    lawyers were in the courthouse. When the plaintiffs’ lawyer later learned of
    the jury members’ actions, he moved before the trial judge for an inquiry. The
    trial judge dismissed the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs seek a new trial on the basis that the
    trial judge erred by not conducting an inquiry and setting aside the jury
    verdict and on the basis of the appearance of a miscarriage of justice. In my
    view, there is no basis to order a new trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs, Bonita Maher and her 15 year old son
    Michael Maher were shopping at the A&amp;P in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Thunder Bay at 11:45 on Friday evening, July
    2, 2004. Ms.&nbsp;Maher was very familiar with the store, having shopped there
    without incident or mishap over many years. While Ms. Maher was looking at the
    meat in the meat chest, the cleaner passed operating a floor scrubbing machine
    and Ms. Maher had to move to avoid its path. As they moved away from the meat
    counter and toward the eggs and dairy, both appellants slipped and lost their
    balance, but the appellant Bonita Maher fell, suffering injuries. Another
    shopper was a witness to the event. He testified that the machine left the
    floor damp behind it and that there was no way to avoid stepping in the path
    that the machine had followed. Other evidence regarding the incident came from
    employees of the cleaner and of the store, the latter of whom wrote in his
    report that he observed no water on the floor. The appellant Bonita Maher also
    gave evidence that when she was on the floor, it did not feel damp under her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were three defendants to the appellants’ action:
    A&amp;P, Central Building Services Group Ltd. (“CBSG”), the company to which
    A&amp;P had contracted the responsibility for cleaning the store, and Adis
    Cleaning Services Ltd., the subcontractor of CBSG, the company that actually
    performed the cleaning. In the action, A&amp;P cross-claimed against both CBSG
    and <span class=SpellE>Adis</span>, <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> cross-claimed
    against A&amp;P, and CBSG cross-claimed against A&amp;P and against <span
class=SpellE>Adis</span>, based on their contracts and for contribution and
    indemnity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was the defendant CBSG that served a jury notice in
    the action. As the trial commenced and progressed, there were a number of
    motions by other defendants to strike the jury. The plaintiffs were content to
    retain the jury for their action. The trial judge consistently declined to
    strike the jury for the main action, but ruled at the beginning of the trial
    that following the jury verdict, he would determine the contractual <span
class=SpellE>crossclaims</span> among the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To that end, the jury was excused for part of the
    evidence that was relevant only to the cross-claims, although they also heard
    some evidence that related both to the cross-claims as well as to the issue of the
    degrees of the respective defendants’ liability to the appellants. The trial
    judge also explained to the jury on a number of occasions during the trial, the
    limit on their role in finding liability. The trial judge made the following
    statements to the jury on this issue at different points during the trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I will also point out at this stage that Mrs. Maher
    is claiming against the three defendants. The three defendants are arguing
    between themselves on various points. Their argument between themselves has
    nothing to do with you. I will decide that after you decide the issue between
    them and the plaintiff, but you will hear some evidence just by the way as to
    the relationship between them, which may or may not affect the plaintiff, but
    as far as you are concerned you are trying the case with respect to the
    plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, I must also tell you that while the plaintiff
    has sued these three defendants, these three defendants have each pointed a
    finger at each other, what we call cross-claims. In other words, the defendants
    are saying to the plaintiff, look, we’re not liable for your slip and even if
    we are liable for your slip you didn’t suffer the damages that you claim you
    suffered, but they also say, oh but, if I happened to be liable it’s not my
    fault it’s his fault. Mr. Simmons acts for A&amp;P, he says we’re not liable,
    but if the jury has a different view, hey, we hired Mr. Birnie’s clients to
    take care of all this and Mr. Birnie’s client says, hey, I’m just a management
    company. I hired Mr. Birston’s client and he’s the one that hired the fellow
    that ran the machine. <i>Now, you don’t have
    to worry about all that because I’m going to decide that after you decide the
    issue between the plaintiff and all of the defendants, but some of these
    questions and answers perhaps the bulk of them relate not to the plaintiff’s
    claim, but relate to cross-claims between the defendants an issue that I will
    get into after you’ve done your job determining the major issue between the
    plaintiff and the defendants</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>So if you’re
    scratching your head and wondering what’s that got to do with this woman’s
    claim against anybody, it may not have anything to do at all quite frankly because
    there’s in effect three or four trials going on in this room right now. You’re
    only hearing one. I’ll be dealing with the other three or two of the cross
    claims</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Gentlemen, I’ve been corrected by counsel. Mr.
    Birston points out that his client does not have any cross-claim against Mr.
    Birnie’s client. When I was pointing fingers I think I may have given you the
    impression that he did. Those claims are nothing to you. You hear Mr. Kim’s
    claim against them all and you decide that. I’ll take it from there. Yes?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Gentleman, as I mentioned to you earlier there are
    claims between various parties following the claim that you’re dealing with,
    and since this man is here I’d like to hear his evidence on that aspect of the
    case at the same time. I am going to ask you to retire for now while I hear his
    evidence on the other parts so you don’t get confused as to what relevance this
    material has. It will have no relevance to your action and we will call you
    back when we are finished with that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All right, Gentleman, the evidence from this point
    on doesn’t concern you so we won’t clutter up your minds with it. You’re free
    to go out to the-your jury room while I hear this evidence that’ll be relative
    to cross claims or to other matters that you don’t have to deal with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge revisited the issue in his charge to
    the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You are concerned only with the claims submitted to
    you by the plaintiffs against the defendants. While you have heard that some of
    the defendants have cross-claims between themselves, I will deal with them. You
    need not concern yourself with them.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Let me talk about damages in general. <span
class=GramE>Damages simply means</span> the monetary or financial compensation
    for loss caused by the wrongful conduct of another. <i>You are required to assess these damages on the basis that you find a
    defendant fully responsible</i>. That is, even if you absolve the defendant
    completely or find a defendant only partially responsible, it is nevertheless
    your duty to assess the damages as though the defendant had been found fully at
    fault. In the event you should find the defendant partially at fault only, do
    not proportionately reduce the quantum of the plaintiff’s damages. I repeat,
    assess the damages as if the defendant was 100 percent responsible. <i>If you have apportioned liability between
    the parties, then counsel and I will work out the appropriate disposition of
    damages after we receive your verdict</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of his charge to the jury, the trial judge
    included some instruction on the <i>Occupiers’
    Liability Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2. The applicable sections are ss. 3 and
    6. Section 3 deals with the duty of care that an occupier owes to an invitee,
    while s. 6 allows an occupier to retain an independent contractor to carry out
    the occupier’s responsibility to invitees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As counsel and the trial judge were unable to conclude
    the wording of the verdict sheet questions for the jury before the final
    addresses and the charge, the jury was not instructed about the wording of the
    questions or how they fit together on the issue of liability and the operation
    of the <i>Occupiers’ Liability Act</i>. The
    only instruction they were given directly on the questions was to answer each
    question except for certain alternative questions with respect to damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury did not ask any questions following the
    charge. The written questions that they were required to answer together with a
    written copy of the charge were delivered to them in the jury room. After
    deliberating for seven hours, the jury returned with the verdict sheet fully
    filled in. The questions and answers were read into the record and all agreed.
    The following is the verdict that was delivered by the jury:</p>

    possible liability of <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> to Ms. Maher, he referred
    to the alleged failure to have a mop man following the cleaning machine and
    suggested to the jury that they consider the point <span lang=EN-US>“</span>very seriously”. He stated: “Something
    caused the plaintiff to slip. As counsel for A&amp;P suggested<span
class=GramE>,</span> the most probable cause was fluid on the floor. Michael
    Maher couldn’t say the floor was wet but it was definitely slippery. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Birston</span> [lawyer for <span class=SpellE>Adis</span>] read
    you a portion of the evidence of Mr. Gilles LeCompte. Let me give you all of
    the evidence that he gave on this point.” The trial judge then read out to the
    jury all of Mr. <span class=SpellE>LeCompte’s</span> evidence on dampness on
    the floor and that he had to walk through it. The trial judge concluded on this
    issue as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=SpellE>Adis</span> Cleaning
    says that the presence of dampness is not the important issue.  The issue is whether there was dampness at
    the location where the plaintiff fell when she fell.  It says there is no evidence of that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, the evidence was that a mop and pail man was
    to follow the machine. One of his jobs was to follow the scrubbing machine
    mopping up any cleaner that might not be vacuumed up from the floor. Mr. Dolph
    testified that on this occasion he did not see anyone following the scrubbing
    machine. On the other hand, Mr. Costa, the machine operator, said that the mop
    man was behind him, perhaps 5 to 20 feet.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In spite of the trial judge’s suggestion to the jury in
    his charge that they should give serious consideration to finding <span
class=SpellE>Adis</span> liable to the plaintiffs because its cleaner left the
    floor damp and potentially dangerous, in the course of thanking the jury for
    their service after they found all defendants not liable, the trial judge told
    them: “I thought your decision was quite reasonable, given the evidence that
    was presented to you.” He then discharged the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next morning, two jurors returned to the court
    house and one of the court officers asked what they were doing back, to which
    one juror replied, according to the court officer: “he was either asked or told
    to return”. This court officer left to find a superior and by the time this second
    court officer arrived to address the situation, all six jurors had lined up at
    the door of their jury room. When a court officer asked why they were there,
    one juror responded: to count (or calculate) the money. When the court officer
    told them that because of their verdict, the plaintiff would not be getting any
    money, she believed the jurors looked surprised or stunned, although at least
    one, and perhaps as many as three, said they were there for letters for their
    employers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing further was done at that time, as neither the
    trial judge nor the lawyers were in the courthouse that morning. When the
    plaintiffs’ counsel learned what had occurred, he brought a motion before the
    trial judge for an inquiry of the jurors as to why they had returned and whether
    it was in respect of their verdict. In his reasons for dismissing the motion,
    the trial judge reviewed the case law on jury inquiry following discharge and
    concluded that the motion must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise two issues with respect to what
    they say should have happened when the jury returned to the courthouse
    following their discharge. The first is that the trial judge erred by failing
    to make inquiries of the jury and dismissing the motion. The second is that
    there was an error by court administration in failing to take steps to assemble
    and question the jurors that morning in order to eliminate the potential for
    reasonable apprehension of bias by the passage of time.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1: Did the trial judge
    err by failing to recall the jurors in order to make inquiries?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ theory is that the jury was misled by
    the trial judge into believing that their role was only to quantify the damages
    and the trial judge would determine as well as allocate liability among the
    defendants. They submit that the answers to the questions where the jury found
    no liability on anyone for the slip and fall together with their return
    following discharge to count or calculate the money, showed that they
    misunderstood their role. In that context, inquiries should have been made to
    determine whether this was the case and if so, a mistrial should have been
    ordered. In the alternative, this court should set aside the jury verdict and
    order a mistrial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court of Canada has addressed the issue of
    what a court should do where there is the possibility of an incorrectly
    recorded or unintended verdict twice in the last 25 years: <i>R. v. Head</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 684, and <i>R. v. Burke</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 857.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Head</i>, the
    appellant had been charged with attempted murder. In his charge to the jury,
    the trial judge provided instructions on lesser, included offences. The jury
    and the accused were both discharged after the jury returned with a verdict of
    not guilty. However, after the judge said that court was adjourned, the jury
    foreman asked to speak and stated: “Well, when we discussed this we thought we
    could find the defendant not guilty of the charge as laid but guilty of a
    lesser charge, is that right?” After hearing submissions from counsel, the trial
    judge determined that he was <i>functus</i> and allowed the not guilty verdict to stand: <i>Head</i> at pp. 694-96 (<span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 16-20).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his majority judgment, McIntyre J. held that in a
    criminal case, while the trial judge retains the authority to clarify any
    errors or ambiguity in a jury verdict before they have been discharged, the
    judge has no authority to make any change to a jury verdict once it has been
    recorded and the jury discharged: <i>Head</i> at pp. 689-91, 694 (<span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 5-8). McIntyre J. agreed
    with the observation in Lamer J.’s concurring reasons that judges have a wider
    discretion in civil cases to recall jurors following the discharge of the jury
    to correct errors or to clarify recorded verdicts: <i>Head</i> at p. 691 (<span class=SpellE>para</span>. 9).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamer J. conducted a very extensive review of the law
    including in civil cases in his concurring reasons. He agreed that following
    discharge of the jury, they cannot be allowed to reconsider their verdict for
    any reason. However, in some circumstances they may be allowed to rectify
    errors made in the recording or transmission of their verdict: <i>Head</i> at pp. 698-700 (<span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    27-30). He quoted from <i>Wigmore on
    Evidence</i> (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    2355, where the learned author points out that it is normally only after the
    jury has been discharged that such errors are ascertained. At pp. 700-01 (<span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 31), Lamer J. referred to the negligence action in <i>McCulloch v. Ottawa Transportation
    Commission</i>, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 443 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), as an example. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that case, the jury had apportioned liability between
    the plaintiff and the defendant in the proportion of 80%/20%. Following the
    discharge of the jury, before the jury had left the courtroom, a member of the
    jury communicated with counsel for the plaintiff that he had recorded the
    proportions in error, and that in fact the jury had awarded them the other way
    around, i.e., 20%/80%: <i>McCulloch</i> at
    p. 444 (<span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 1-2). The Court of Appeal corrected
    the error. In his reasons, Hope J.A. stated, at p. 445 (<span class=SpellE>para</span>.&nbsp;3):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree thoroughly ... that no evidence can be
    received by way of affidavit or otherwise after the delivery of the verdict to
    explain some error or mistake which occurred during the deliberation of the
    members of the jury in the jury-room before arriving at a verdict. However, I
    think the cases are quite clear that where a verdict has been reached by a
    jury, a unanimous verdict, as in this case, and some clerical error has
    occurred either in recording that verdict in the jury room or by the jury in
    reporting it to Court, then affidavits may be received, in the interest of
    justice, to disclose what the true verdict of the jury was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, in <i>Danis
    v. Saumure</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 403, in support of his appeal on the basis that
    the verdict was perverse, the appellant sought to file the affidavits of a number
    of the jurors, attesting that the findings were not the ones they had intended: <span class=SpellE><i>Danis</i></span> at p.
    405. The court would not give effect to this evidence. This evidence went
    beyond errors in transmission of the verdict to errors in the deliberations of
    the jury, and was, on that basis, inadmissible: <span class=SpellE><i>Danis</i></span> at pp. 405-07.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamer J. concluded in <i>Head</i>, that once the foreman indicated a possible error, the trial
    judge should have reconvened the jury in the jury box and made inquiries
    regarding the nature of the error. If the error was that the jury had reached
    further verdicts on the included offences but had just not transmitted them to
    the court, then the judge had the authority to receive the verdicts at that
    time. However, if the jury had intended to deliberate further on those
    verdicts, then that could not be done once they had delivered their verdict and
    been discharged. The problem could then only be dealt with by the Court of
    Appeal: <i>Head</i> at p. 704 (<span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 38).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of a miscommunication of a jury verdict arose
    again in 2002 in <i>R. v. Burke</i>, another
    attempt murder case. There, when the foreman of the jury announced the verdict
    as “guilty as charged”, the judge, the registrar and others heard “not guilty”.
    That verdict was recorded and the accused and the jury were discharged. A court
    officer who was escorting the jurors out asked the foreman what the verdict had
    been and he told her “guilty”. When she returned and learned that the verdict
    had been recorded as “not guilty”, she reported this error to the trial judge
    within seven to nine minutes after the verdict had been announced in court: <i>Burke</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    26-27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court conducted three inquires, one later that day,
    one the next day and a third four days later. The second two were with the full
    jury reassembled, but without the accused who had not been relocated. It became
    clear that the foreman had spoken softly but had said “guilty as charged”, and
    that that was what the other jurors had heard and agreed to: <i>Burke</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    29-33. <span class=GramE>The</span> trial judge held that he had the
    jurisdiction to change the recorded verdict where there was a transmission
    error. He also found that there was no basis to say that the jurors had been
    tainted between the time they rendered the verdict and the inquiries. He
    therefore vacated the inaccurately recorded verdict, recorded the verdict as
    guilty, and sentenced the accused: <i>Burke</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 36-37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Burke,</i> the
    Supreme Court decided that the rule enunciated by the majority in <i>Head</i>, that a court has no jurisdiction
    to correct a verdict after the jury has been discharged, should be revisited
    and the more flexible approach that was taken by Lamer&nbsp;J. should be
    adopted: <i>Burke</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    50-52. <span class=GramE>Under</span> the new rule, a court has a limited
    jurisdiction to inquire into an alleged jury error where correction of the
    error does not involve any further deliberations by the jury. In other words,
    the error cannot be one that challenges the validity of the verdict actually
    reached by the jury or involves the jury changing its mind for any reason: <i>Burke</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    53-55. <span class=GramE>Then</span> only where the nature of the error is one
    that can be corrected, can the court conduct an inquiry to determine whether
    there is a reasonable apprehension that the jury was biased or tainted during
    its dispersal. If not, then the court may enter the proper verdict. If there is
    an apprehension of bias, the court may either confirm the verdict or declare a
    mistrial: <i>Burke </i>at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 56, 70, 74. At <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 70,
    Major J. summarized the law regarding post-discharge jury inquiries:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The first question that a trial judge must ask
    post-discharge is whether the error is one that requires reconsideration of the
    verdict. If it requires redeliberation of the verdict, there are no
    circumstances under which the judge will retain or otherwise possess
    jurisdiction to reconvene the jury and conduct an inquiry into the alleged
    error. The trial has concluded and the jury’s function is finished. The jury is
    not then permitted to change its mind. If the error does not require the jury
    to reconsider its verdict, then the trial judge possesses jurisdiction to
    conduct an inquiry, the nature of the inquiry being whether the facts of the
    case disclose a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamer J.’s articulation is also instructive. At pp.
    703-04 (<span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 37-38) of <i>Head,</i> Lamer J. discussed what the trial judge should have done in
    that case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the very clear instructions by the judge
    regarding the possible subsidiary verdicts, the blanket statement of “not
    guilty” by the foreman would normally have ended the matter had it not been for
    the doubt cast on its accuracy by the foreman’s remarks, where he said: “when
    we discussed this we thought we could find the Defendant not guilty of the
    charge as laid, but guilty of a lesser offence, is that right?” What had until
    then been rightly considered as a complete and clear verdict became uncertain.
    As of the moment of that statement the trial judge should have inquired further
    into this comment by the foreman. He should have had all the jury members
    recalled to the jury box and, with all of them present, he should have
    addressed the jury with a view to ascertaining the precise nature of the
    problem.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are various ways of doing this. As an
    example, he could have first ascertained whether they had, prior to their being
    discharged, arrived at a verdict and wanted to correct or complete the
    transmission of the verdict at which they had arrived. If such was the case he
    could then have instructed the clerk of the court to register that verdict. If,
    through questioning, he had found out that they had not come to a final verdict
    prior to their discharge, then the trial judge could not permit them to reopen
    their deliberations; for once they had recorded a verdict and had been
    discharged, their jurisdiction to make findings was spent. The problem could
    then only be dealt with in the Court of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is clear from the extensive discussions and analyses
    together with the results in <i>Head </i>and <i>Burke,</i> is that there is no
    jurisdiction either in criminal or civil cases for the court to make inquiries of
    a jury post-discharge where the nature of the possible jury error requires
    further deliberations by a jury to clarify or modify the verdict as it was
    decided and recorded. The examples in civil cases where a jury verdict was
    amended after the jury was discharged involve correcting an error in the
    recording or transmission of the verdict already rendered by the jury such as
    the 80/20 liability split reversal in <i>McCulloch</i>.
    Where the jury may have misunderstood the effect of its verdict or the
    instructions of the trial judge, and would need to have further deliberations
    to reconsider the verdict, the law is clear that in that case, there is no
    jurisdiction in the court to make inquiries or to allow the jury to reconsider
    the verdict if this occurs after it has been discharged. Of course, if such an
    error is discovered before the jury is discharged, then the court is not <i>functus </i>and it may send the jury back
    for further deliberations.</p>
  <h3>Application to this Case</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, we have very little information as to why
    all six members of the jury returned to their jury room the day after they had
    rendered their verdict and been discharged by the trial judge. What we have is
    the evidence of the court staff that this was virtually unprecedented; that one
    said they came to count or calculate the money; that they looked stunned or
    surprised when they were told that they had awarded nothing to the plaintiff;
    that one said he was asked or told to return; and that some said they were
    there for letters to their employers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the question articulated by Lamer J. in <i>Head</i>, did this information about the
    conduct of the jury make the verdict uncertain, requiring the trial judge to
    call the jury together in order make inquiries?  In my view, although it was odd for all members of the jury to return
    the next morning, there were plausible reasons for their conduct. They knew
    that the trial judge intended to deal with the <span class=SpellE>crossclaims</span>,
    which he in fact did although not until a few weeks later. And some said they
    had come for letters for their employers or were told or asked to return. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arguably, there was some basis at least to try to find
    out if there was any error in the minds of the jury. However, to the extent
    that the jury’s return might indicate that they made an error, since the
    verdict sheet was in writing and consisted of “no” answers to the questions
    regarding a failure by the defendants, followed by a line through the area
    where details of a “yes” answer would have been given, and “yes” answers to the
    questions regarding taking proper care, there is no basis to consider a
    miscommunication of the verdict. Furthermore, the verdict was read out in court
    and all jurors agreed with it. Therefore, any possible error would have had to involve
    a misunderstanding by the jury of the effect of its verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What occurred in this case is very reminiscent of what
    occurred in <i>Rose v. <span class=SpellE>Sabourin</span></i> (1994), 31 C.P.C (3d) 309 (Ont. Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)), <span class=SpellE>aff’d</span> (1997), 14 C.P.C. (4th) 193 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).   That was also an occupier’s liability action,
    although in a personal as opposed to a commercial context. The action was based
    on the plaintiff’s fall down the basement stairs in the defendant’s house. The
    jury also answered questions on a verdict sheet on liability and damages. The
    jury answered “yes” to the first question on liability: “Did the defendant …
    take reasonable care in all the circumstances of the case to see that the
    plaintiff … was reasonably safe while in the defendant’s home?” The sheet
    instructed the jury to go to question # 6, the first damages question, if the
    answer to question # 1 was “yes”, and the jury did that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the jury came back with its verdict, the trial
    judge read out the answers from the verdict sheet and verified with the foreman
    that those were the answers of the jury. The trial judge then thanked the jury,
    discharged them, endorsed the record dismissing the action and dealt with
    costs. After leaving the court room, the deputy reported to the trial judge
    that one or more of the jurors had asked him: (1) how would the plaintiffs get
    their money<span class=GramE>?;</span> (2) when would they receive the money?;
    and (3) who would pay them the money?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge asked the deputy and another court
    officer to set out in writing their recollections of what was said to them by
    jury members and these statements were forwarded to counsel by the trial judge.
    Counsel made a motion about a month later for an order setting aside the
    verdict as perverse and directing a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that she had no jurisdiction to
    consider the motion and that the jury was <i>functus </i>after the verdict was endorsed on the record: <i>Rose</i> (1994) at p. 312 (<span class=SpellE>para</span>.&nbsp;14).
    She referred, at pp. 313-14 (<span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 18-20), to Lamer
    J.’s reasons in <i>Head </i>and to the
    narrow exception to rectify an error in the transmission or recording of a
    verdict to the general rule that following its discharge, the jury is <i>functus</i>. She noted that the answers on
    the verdict sheet were unambiguous and that she was obliged to record the
    jury’s verdict. The issue of a new trial was for the Court of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a short endorsement, the Court of Appeal endorsed
    the reasoning of the trial judge and concluded, at p. 193 (<span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    2): “Assuming the judge had the jurisdiction [to] question the jury, nothing
    happened in this case that would justify it.” The appeal was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although <i>Rose</i> was decided before <i>Burke,</i> <i>Burke</i> did not extend the ambit of an
    inquiry post-discharge beyond the narrow exception for transmission and
    recording errors, and clarified that the nature of an inquiry of the jury in
    that narrow circumstance was to determine reasonable apprehension of bias. The
    only distinction I can see between the <i>Rose</i> case and this appeal is the possible confusion in this case caused by the
    splitting of functions between the judge and jury respecting the liability for
    the <span class=SpellE>crossclaims</span>. However, if there was any such
    confusion, it was not noted by trial counsel who made no objection to any of
    the judge’s remarks. Nor was there objection to the charge on this issue.
    Although it would have been much more helpful had the trial judge reviewed the
    questions to be answered with the jury, the fact that the questions were only
    finalized after the charge was complete is not a ground of appeal, nor can one
    say whether it caused actual confusion to the jury. Again, there was no perception
    of jury confusion by counsel or the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rose,</i> the
    Court of Appeal did not discuss in its brief reasons the issue of the role of
    that court in ordering a new trial for a perceived jury error where the trial
    judge was <i>functus</i>. The Court of
    Appeal did not so order in that case. Nor would I in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there was a clear basis on the record for a
    verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, one cannot say that the jury’s verdict was
    perverse. It was open to the jury to find that all reasonable care had been
    taken and that was certainly argued to them. In his charge, the trial judge
    signalled to the jury that there was a basis in the evidence for imposing
    liability on <span class=SpellE>Adis</span> for not having a mop man following
    the floor cleaning machine, by telling them that they should pay particular
    attention to the evidence of the independent witness who observed the cleaning
    machine leave a damp trail that he had to walk through. However, when the jury
    returned their no liability verdict, the trial judge told them it was a
    reasonable one on the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in <i>Rose</i>,
    in this case the answers on the verdict sheet were clear and confirmed by the
    jury foreman before discharge. There could be no issue of miscommunication of
    the verdict. As in <i>Rose</i>, one could
    speculate, based on the jury’s comment about why they <span class=GramE>returned,</span> that some or all may not have understood that by finding that the defendants
    had not failed in their duty under the <i>Occupiers’
    Liability Act</i>, there was no one else to pay the plaintiffs the damages they
    had suffered. If this misunderstanding did occur, that is unfortunate, but
    would not have changed the outcome. Nor does it provide any basis for
    interfering with the jury’s verdict in fact or in law.</p>
  <h3>Issue 2: Should court staff have taken steps to ensure that the trial judge
    and the parties were advised of the jury’s return following their discharge?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons
    given above on Issue 1, as this matter has been squarely raised, I agree that
    it warrants some comment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these cases, where there may be a jury error that is
    correctable by the trial judge after the jury has been discharged, it is
    critical that the jury be reassembled as quickly as possible to try to avoid
    the problem of reasonable apprehension of bias because of the potential for
    exposure to outside influences in the community during dispersal. For that
    reason, where court staff learn of a potential issue, it is imperative that it
    be brought to the attention of the trial judge immediately and that the trial
    judge inform counsel immediately, as was done in the <i>Rose </i>case. Even where the error is not one that is potentially
    correctable, as in this case, it is still essential that the trial judge and
    counsel be informed immediately so that counsel can take whatever steps they
    believe appropriate to bring the matter forward for adjudication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To that end, it may be appropriate to devise and
    implement a protocol for court staff in such cases, to ensure that the trial
    judge and counsel are immediately notified if any issue arises with the jury
    post-discharge.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss the appeal, in the
    circumstances, without costs.<span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>
