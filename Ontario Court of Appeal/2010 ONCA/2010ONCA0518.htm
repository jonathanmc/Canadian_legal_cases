  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant, David Gray, is a sole proprietor who carries on business as All
    Sports Accommodations (ASA).  ASA
    arranges hotel accommodations for sports teams.  In doing so, it is paid commissions by the hotels where the teams
    stay.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    February 19, 2007, the appellant was charged with acting as a travel agent
    without first being registered as a travel agent, contrary to s. 4(1)(a) of the <i>Travel Industry Act</i> <i>2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sched. D (“the
    Act”).  He was found not guilty by a
    Justice of the Peace.  On appeal to the
    Ontario Court of Justice, this was reversed and a conviction entered.  Because the case raises the interpretation of
    the term “travel agent” in s. 1(1) of the Act, MacPherson J.A. granted leave to
    appeal to this court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that, properly interpreted, “travel agent”
    encompasses the appellant’s activities.  I would therefore uphold the conviction and dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    facts are not in dispute.  At trial, the
    appellant explained how his business works and acknowledged that he is not
    registered as a travel agent under the Act.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ASA
    has contracts with various hotels, pursuant to which it is authorized to offer
    rooms to sports teams at the lowest group rate.  In return, ASA receives a ten percent commission from the hotel on all
    booked rooms that are occupied.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Typically,
    a sports team contacts ASA with information about the municipality it is to
    visit, the number of hotel rooms it needs, the dates of its visit, and the
    approximate price range it seeks.  ASA
    then supplies the team with a list of appropriate hotels together with their
    cancellation policies.  Once the team
    makes a selection, ASA sends the team an agreement form setting out the details
    of the reservations to be made.  When the
    agreement is accepted by the team, it supplies ASA with a list of credit card
    numbers from the team members in order to hold the reservation. ASA then
    forwards that list to the hotel.  ASA
    subsequently supplies each team member with information about the hotel,
    including rules of the premises and a map to the hotel location.  On occupancy, the team members pay the hotel
    for their rooms with the credit cards used to secure the reservation or by
    other means.  Ultimately, ASA receives a
    fee from the hotel equal to ten percent of the value of the rooms
    occupied.  ASA receives no remuneration
    from the team or its members.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    trial, representatives of hotels that ASA has contracts with testified that
    they deal with registered travel agents in the same way as they deal with ASA,
    and pay those travel agents the same commission on the same basis.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE JUDGMENTS BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1(1) of the Act defines “travel agent” as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“travel agent” means a person who sells, to
    consumers, travel services provided by another person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 4(1)(a) of the Act makes it an offence for a
    person to act as a travel agent  who is
    not registered as such under the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first instance, the Justice of the Peace concluded
    that because ASA receives no consideration from the teams or their members, it
    has no contract with them and therefore is not engaged in selling travel
    services to them.  He therefore acquitted
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Ontario Court of Justice also focused on
    whether the appellant contracted as principal to sell travel services to the
    sports teams and their members.  The
    court found that the commission flowing from the hotel to ASA constitutes
    sufficient consideration to support the conclusion that ASA sells travel
    services to consumers. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the appellant
    was convicted.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  While I reach
    the same conclusion as the Ontario Court of Justice, I do so by a somewhat
    different route.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    fundamental issue is the interpretation of “travel agent” in the Act.  To review, it is defined in s. 1(1) this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“travel agent” means a person who sells, to
    consumers, travel services provided by another person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also relevant is the definition of “travel services” in
    s. 1(1):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“travel services” means transportation, sleeping
    accommodation or other services for the use of a traveller, tourist or
    sightseer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that, in the context of this case,
    the “consumers” are the sports teams and their members.  Nor is there any doubt that the hotels are
    providing “travel services” to them.  The
    question is whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the appellant can
    be said to be selling those services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both courts approached this question implicitly assuming
    that the statutory definition of “travel agent” is limited to circumstances in
    which the person sells as a principal.  In other words, only one who contracts on his own behalf to sell travel
    services to consumers meets the definition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I think that is too narrow an
    approach.  In my view, the definition
    also encompasses one who sells travel services to consumers not as principal,
    but as an agent for the provider of those services.  I say this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the clear purpose of the Act is to regulate the
    travel industry in the interest of the travelling public.  In that sense, it is consumer protection
    legislation.  Pursuant to companion
    legislation - <i>The Safety and Consumer
    Statutes Administration Act 1996, </i>S.O. 1996, c. 19 - the Travel Industry
    Council of Ontario has been designated by the Crown to carry out the regulation
    of the travel industry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The scope of the regulatory regime is significant.  The Act prohibits anyone from acting as a
    travel agent unless the person meets the prescribed requirements and is
    properly registered under the Act.  It
    sets up a mechanism for receiving and addressing complaints about a travel
    agent.  It regulates the advertising done
    by those in the travel industry, and prohibits the making of false or deceptive
    statements relating to the provision of travel services.  Regulations pursuant to the Act specify the
    information that the travelling public must receive before paying for travel
    services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Act also establishes and requires participation in
    the Travel Industry Compensation Fund, which is designed to protect the
    travelling public against travel agents defaulting on their obligations.
    Although it is true that a travel agent who does not receive payments from the
    travelling public presents no risk to this fund, the fund is but one part of a
    broader set of regulations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, to confine such a comprehensive
    regulatory regime to the sale of travel services by a person acting as a
    principal and to exclude the sale of such services by a person acting on behalf
    of the service provider is to interpret the statutory language too narrowly to
    achieve its intended purpose.  Put
    another way, since the evidence was clear that many travel agents engage in
    both kinds of sales, a narrow reading of the statutory definition would provide,
    at best, only a partial regulation of the travel industry.  This would fall short of the legislative
    intention.  It would exclude sales of
    travel services to consumers by persons acting on behalf of the service
    provider, in the course of which those persons would perform the very
    activities that the Act seeks to regulate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, there is the statutory language itself.  The Act defines a travel agent as a person
    who sells “travel services provided by another person”.  This language is consistent with the travel
    agent selling those services on behalf of the provider of those services.  In addition the very description of the
    seller as a “travel <u>agent</u>” suggests a legislative intention to encompass
    within the definition a person who sells travel services as agent for the
    service provider.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the task of statutory interpretation can be
    assisted by examining O.Reg 26/05, which was made pursuant to the Act.  The Regulation complements the legislative
    regime by, for example, detailing the kind of information that must be supplied
    to a customer before payment for travel services can be accepted.  The Act and the Regulation form an integrated
    scheme for the regulation of the travel industry in the interests of the
    travelling public.  In such circumstances,
    the Regulation can assist in ascertaining the legislature’s intention with
    regard to a particular matter:  see <i>Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Ontario
    (Superintendant of Financial Services),</i> [2004] 3 S.C.R. 152, at para.
    35.  In this case, that matter is what is
    meant by “selling travel services”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the Regulation defines “sales in Ontario”
    of travel services by a registered travel agent as “the amount paid or to be
    paid through the travel agent for all travel services sold in Ontario.”  This clearly includes both sales where the
    travel agent sells as a principal and receives payment from the consumer in
    return, and sales where the travel agent effects the sale on behalf of a
    service provider, where payment is made later to the service provider.  The broader interpretation of the statutory
    definition of “travel agent” ensures conformity between the legislation and the
    regulation that together form this integrated regulatory scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore conclude that the proper interpretation of
    “travel agent” in the Act includes a person who sells travel services to
    consumers as agent for the provider of those services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the facts of this case, there is no doubt
    that the appellant meets that definition.  When he, as ASA, contracts with a hotel, he is given authority by the
    hotel to offer its rooms at the lowest group rate.  When he does so, the consumer accepts by
    supplying him with credit card information which he passes on to the hotel, and
    the sale of the hotel rooms at the specified price for the specified dates is
    made.  The contract includes a
    cancellation clause under which, if the consumer so chooses, the sale is
    cancelled.  Otherwise, the sale is closed
    when the rooms are occupied and paid for.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By engaging in this activity, the appellant sells
    services to consumers as agent for the provider of those services.  As such, he was required to be registered as a
    travel agent under the Act.  Since he was
    not, he was properly convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal must be dismissed.</p>
