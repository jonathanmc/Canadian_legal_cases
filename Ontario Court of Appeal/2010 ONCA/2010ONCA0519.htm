  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant mother appeals from the judgment of
    Harris J. ordering joint custody of the couple’s two children.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in several respects.  First, in
    ordering joint custody in the face of evidence that the parents were unable to
    co-operate or communicate.  Second, in
    failing to take into account the history of domestic violence.  Third, in failing to incorporate a dispute
    resolution mechanism.  And fourth, in
    providing that the respondent have a minimum of 50 percent of the time with the
    children.  For the following reasons, the
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Joint Custody</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s principal submission that joint custody
    was inappropriate focused on a portion of the trial judge’s reasons where he
    said that there was “a realistic hope that these parties will be able to work
    together for the benefit of their children and without the difficulties of
    rules and demands”.  The appellant relies
    upon decisions from this court such as <i>Kaplanis
    v. Kaplanis </i>(2005), 10 R.F.L. (6th) 373, at para. 11, holding that joint
    custody <span class=GramE>is</span> inappropriate where there is merely a
    “hope” that communication between the parties will improve.  These cases indicate that there must be an
    evidentiary basis for belief that joint custody will be feasible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, there was an evidentiary basis in this
    case for the joint custody order.  The
    facts are somewhat unique.  For most of
    the period prior to the trial, because of an allegation of domestic abuse, the
    respondent was under a court order preventing him from communicating directly
    with the appellant.  In the result,
    communication concerning the children was largely carried out through written
    messages and between the appellant and the respondent’s mother.  The use of the term “realistic hope” must be
    seen in that context.  There was evidence,
    which was accepted by the trial judge, from which he could conclude that with
    the termination of the court orders the parties would be able to effectively
    communicate and that joint custody was in the best interests of the
    children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that respect, we do not agree with the submission
    that the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the report of the Office of the
    Children’s Lawyer clinical investigator favouring joint custody.  The trial judge took the report into account
    but there is no basis for the submission that he delegated his decision making
    to the investigator or gave the recommendation undue weight.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Domestic Abuse</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    failing to consider the respondent’s abusive conduct towards the
    appellant.  On July 6, 2007, the parties
    became involved in an argument over the appellant’s threats to prevent or
    restrict the respondent’s access to the children.  Exactly what occurred was a matter of
    considerable dispute.  Almost two weeks
    later, after another argument, the appellant complained to the police and the
    respondent was charged with threatening.  Many months later, the charge was withdrawn and the respondent entered
    into a peace bond.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was in the best position to determine
    the importance of this incident and the several other incidents of bad
    behaviour alleged by both parties.  His
    conclusion on those incidents is summarized in this paragraph:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Small matters, idiosyncrasies, and immature
    conduct, at trial, [were] made to look large and destructive but after all the
    evidence was completed the picture of this couple [is that they are] relatively
    balanced ... emotionally and to my mind, quite capable of working this matter
    through on a joint custody with equally shared access.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a conclusion that the trial judge was entitled
    to reach on the evidence.  The appellant
    has not shown a basis for interfering with the trial judge’s decision.  See <i>Ursie
    v. Ursie</i> (2006), 32 R.F.L. (6th) 23 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 18 and 19.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Dispute Resolution Mechanism</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 6 of the Judgement provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.  The
    parties shall have joint decision making in the important issues like health,
    education, extracurricular activities etc.  In the event that the parties disagree, as most parents do from time to
    time, they shall have to work it through like others do or alternatively hire a
    mediator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was not represented by counsel at trial and
    it does not appear that either he or the appellant’s counsel raised the issue
    of a dispute resolution mechanism.  Without
    submissions or evidence on this issue, the trial judge was not in a position to
    provide for a dispute-resolution mechanism, such as giving each of the parties
    the final decision on various matters.  Similarly, we do not have the necessary evidence or information to
    impose any kind of mechanism.  In the
    circumstances, if the parties do reach an impasse over an issue, they will have
    to apply to the Superior Court of Justice to vary the Judgment.  The answer is not for this court to impose a
    solution in the absence of a proper record.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Access</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the valid point that the Judgment
    is awkwardly worded in providing that, although the children were to have their
    primary residence with the appellant, the respondent was to have “at a minimum,
    50% of the time with the children”.  In
    other words, the access term seems inconsistent with the primary residence
    term.  That said, the balance of the
    Judgment sets out the access schedule in considerable detail, and does not
    appear to give the respondent more than 50% of the time with the children.  We can see no basis for interfering with how
    the trial judge exercised his discretion.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed
    at $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
