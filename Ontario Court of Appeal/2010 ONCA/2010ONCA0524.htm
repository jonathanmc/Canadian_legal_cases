  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the trustee in bankruptcy of the
    respondent, Hans Peter <span class=SpellE>Koenne</span>.  The issue in this appeal is whether the
    appellant is estopped from obtaining a declaration that the respondent’s
    interest in his father’s estate, acquired during bankruptcy, vested in the trustee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that estoppel applied and
    dismissed the trustee’s motion.  For the
    reasons that follow, I conclude that estoppel has no application on the facts
    of this case.  I would therefore allow
    the appeal and grant the declaration sought by the trustee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts are not in dispute.  On June 21, 2004, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne</span> made an assignment in bankruptcy and the appellant was appointed the trustee of
    his estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 16, 2006, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne’s</span> father died, leaving a will dividing his estate equally between Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Koenne</span> and his brother.  While a codicil to the will purported to alter this, both parties now
    agree that the codicil is invalid and has no legal effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the summer of 2008, the trustee was advised that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne’s</span> father had passed away and that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Koenne</span> might be a beneficiary under the will.  On December 8, 2008, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne</span> advised the trustee that the only asset of his father’s estate was a cottage
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trustee unsuccessfully requested on a number of
    occasions that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne</span> supply a copy of the
    will.  Finally, on January 21, 2009, the trustee
    obtained a court order requiring him to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 19, 2009, the trustee wrote to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Koenne’s</span> brother – the executor of their father’s estate - setting
    out its position that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne’s</span> interest in his
    father’s estate vested in the trustee for the benefit of creditors, and
    requiring him to account for any assets received from the estate.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne’s</span> brother responded on February 27, 2009, confirming that the cottage property
    was the only asset of the estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 17, 2009, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne</span> was granted an absolute discharge from bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cottage <span class=GramE>property became the
    subject of litigation between a third party and, <i>inter</i></span><i> alia</i>, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Koenne</span>.  The
    litigation was set to proceed to trial when the trustee served its motion,
    returnable September 2, 2009.  The
    litigation was eventually settled on terms that are irrelevant to the issue in
    this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne</span> opposed the trustee’s
    motion on the basis that the trustee should be estopped from obtaining the
    declaration it sought, namely that his interest in his father’s estate vested
    while he was a bankrupt and therefore vested in the trustee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge agreed.  The entirety of her reasons is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Motion heard and dismissed.  In my view the Trustee is estopped from
    claiming the asset.  Absolute discharge
    was granted June 17, 2009.  At that time
    the Trustee was aware of Will and Codicil and took no step to discharge
    bankrupt with conditions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this appeal there is no debate about the following legal propositions:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as amended (the BIA) provides, in
    s. 71, that once an assignment in bankruptcy is made, the property of the
    bankrupt vests in the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 67(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) provides that
    this includes any property acquired by the bankrupt before discharge.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The definition of “property” in s. 2 includes an
    interest in the estate of a deceased person.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discharge of the bankrupt does not affect the
    provisions of the BIA that vest the property of the bankrupt in the trustee.  These assets remain vested in the trustee for
    the general benefit of the creditors: see <span class=SpellE>Houlder</span> and
    Morawetz, <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law
    of Canada</i> (loose-leaf<span class=GramE>)(</span>Toronto: Carswell, 2009),
    at p. 3-450.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in dispute is the applicability of the
    doctrine of estoppel to the facts in this case.  There is no doubt that a trustee can be barred from claiming an asset on
    the ground of estoppel:  see <span
class=SpellE>Houlder</span> and Morawetz, <i>2010
    Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> (Toronto: Carswell, 2009), at p.
    553.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in order to rely on estoppel, a bankrupt must
    establish that:</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trustee, by words or conduct, made a promise or
    assurance that was intended to affect its legal relationship with the bankrupt
    and intended the bankrupt to act upon the representation; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bankrupt, relying on the representation, acted on
    it or in some way changed its position.  See <i>Deloitte and <span
class=SpellE>Touche</span> LLP v. Marino </i>(2005), 72 O.R. (3d) 274 (C.A.),
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is no evidence of any
    representation by the trustee other than its asserted position on February 19,
    2009 that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koenne’s</span> inheritance vested in the trustee.  While the trustee could have asked for a
    condition that confirmed its right to the inherited property as a term of the
    discharge, the fact that the trustee did not do so cannot be taken as a
    representation that it would not rely on the legal position provided by the BIA,
    which it asserted on February 19, 2009.  The respondent can point to nothing else that might constitute the
    necessary representation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any evidence that the bankrupt changed his
    position concerning the inheritance on the basis of anything done or said by
    the trustee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, there is simply no evidence of either a
    representation on the part of the trustee or reliance on the part of the bankrupt.  Estoppel has not been made out in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal must be allowed.  The trustee is entitled to the declaration
    sought.  It is entitled to costs of
    $4,700, inclusive of disbursements and GST, payable out of the estate.</p>
