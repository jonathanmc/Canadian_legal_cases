  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the trial judge, we are of the view that he committed
    several material errors in concluding that the gun and drugs found in the trunk
    and interior of the Honda motor vehicle driven by the respondent should be
    excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge found that the police violated the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> rights on several occasions in various ways, as we read his
    reasons, the most egregious of the breaches and the one on which his s. 24(2)
    analysis effectively turned was the second of two s. 10(b) breaches committed
    by P.C. Quail and the consequences flowing from it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The violation in question occurred following the respondent’s lawful
    arrest for driving while suspended and the lawful search of his person incident
    thereto, as found by the trial judge, which led to the discovery of a number of
    ecstasy pills concealed on his person. After asking the respondent what the
    pills were, knowing full well that they were ecstasy pills, and receiving an
    inculpatory response (the first of P.C. Quail's s. 10(b) breaches), P.C. Quail
    informed the respondent of his s. 10(b) rights and the respondent indicated
    that he wished to speak to a lawyer. Rather than refraining from asking further
    questions before facilitating the respondent’s request, P.C. Quail asked the
    respondent a question about officer safety in relation to the Honda. After a
    brief delay, the respondent replied that there was “half a pound of weed in the
    trunk”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to P.C. Quail’s testimony that he intended to search the vehicle,
    including the trunk, after finding ecstasy pills on the respondent and that the
    respondent’s answer that there was marijuana in the trunk was not the basis
    upon which he decided to search the car, the trial judge found otherwise. In
    short, he disbelieved P.C. Quail and found as a fact, at para. 66 of his
    reasons that “the [respondent’s] response ... that there was marijuana in the
    trunk was the basis for searching the trunk because [the respondent] told [P.C.
    Quail] that there was a half pound of weed in the trunk”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That finding was crucial to the trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis. In
    short, the trial judge found that but for the second breach of the respondent’s
    s. 10(b) rights, P.C. Quail would not have searched the trunk or indeed the
    interior of the car and thus he would not have found the gun and marijuana or
    the other drugs secreted in the vehicle. And it was this second s. 10(b)
    breach, which the trial judge described as flagrant and deliberate, that
    largely dictated the outcome of the s. 24(2) analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In making the finding that P.C. Quail would not have searched the
    respondent’s vehicle but for the answer he received to his question about
    officer safety, we are respectfully of the view that the trial judge committed
    several material errors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in rejecting P.C. Quail’s evidence, the trial judge failed to
    consider critical evidence given by the respondent bearing directly on that
    issue. In particular, the respondent testified that after P.C. Quail discovered
    the ecstasy pills on his person, he and P.C. Quail had the following dialogue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well, he tells me “Okay, I’m going to search your car now”, and I
    respond to him, “No you can’t. It’s not my car”. And he then responds, “Well
    you lied to us and we found drugs on your – in your pocket, so we are going to
    search your car anyways”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is true, as the trial judge observed, that P.C. Quail did not recall
    telling the respondent that it was his intention to search the car after
    finding the ecstasy pills on his person, surely it was incumbent upon the trial
    judge to at least consider the respondent’s testimony in this regard before
    rejecting P.C. Quail’s evidence as incredible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rejecting P.C. Quail’s evidence, the trial judge placed considerable
    emphasis on the timing of the search of the trunk. At para. 66 of his reasons,
    after finding that the basis for the search of the trunk was the respondent’s
    answer to P.C. Quail that there was marijuana in the trunk, the trial judge
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>P.C. Quail said he informed the [respondent] of the
    possession of the ecstasy pills between 8:50 and 8:55. The trunk was not
    searched until 9:10 p.m.  If P.C. Quail intended to search the vehicle when he
    found the ecstasy pills, there is no explanation why he waited until 9:10 p.m.
    to search the trunk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, P.C. McGuigan testified that after learning about the
    marijuana in the trunk, he was uncertain whether he and his fellow officers had
    the right to search the trunk without a warrant. To that end, he contacted
    Detective Anderson of the Drugs and Vice Unit to determine if a warrant was
    needed. After outlining the circumstances of the respondent’s arrest, including
    the finding of ecstasy pills on his person and his statement to the police that
    he had a large amount of marijuana in his trunk, P.C. McGuigan was told that it
    was the impression of the Drug Unit that the search of the trunk was legal and
    that he and his fellow officers could continue their search. P.C. Quail
    confirmed this aspect of P.C. McGuigan’s testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, P.C. McGuigan’s evidence was significant in two respects.
    First, it was capable of explaining the delay that preceded the search of the vehicle;
    second, it was capable of showing that the police were taking care to ensure
    that they were acting in compliance with the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not take this evidence into account, either in
    assessing P.C.&nbsp;Quail’s evidence that it was his intention from the outset
    to search the respondent’s vehicle, including the trunk, or in assessing the seriousness
    of the police conduct in the context of his s. 24(2) analysis. With respect, he
    erred in failing to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further erred in failing to consider the circumstances
    surrounding the second s. 10(b) breach – circumstances which in our view may
    have attenuated the impact of the <i>Charter</i> breach on the protected
    interests of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question put to the respondent by P.C. Quail, in breach of the
    respondent’s s.&nbsp;10(b) rights, was directed at officer safety. The
    respondent confirmed this in cross-examination as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And I’ll suggest to you, Mr. Nguyen, that
    he – just before searching the car, Constable Quail had asked you whether there
    was anything he needed to be aware of in your car for officer safety purposes... </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the respondent did not agree that he responded to that question by
    informing P.C. Quail about the marijuana in the trunk, the trial judge
    disbelieved the respondent in that regard and accepted P.C. Quail’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two matters of significance arise from this. First, on the respondent’s
    own testimony, P.C. Quail’s question was not designed to elicit an
    incriminatory response about other drugs that might be in the car. His question
    was directed at officer safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the respondent provided an answer that was not elicited by the
    question, and he did so for a particular reason. As he explained in his
    testimony, he volunteered the information about the marijuana in the trunk
    because he wanted to protect his passengers, who knew nothing about it, from
    being arrested for it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. Now you said just a little while
    ago that you felt that you had to tell Officer Quail about the marijuana in the
    trunk. Can you tell the court what caused you to feel that way?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Well, before I left the house I put the
    marijuana into the trunk of my car. I didn’t inform Jerry or Simon that there would
    be marijuana in the trunk of my car and I felt very bad that they would have to
    be in this position with me when they had no clue whatsoever, and it was all
    because of my doing. I felt as if they would be arrested and charged for
    something that they did not have any idea about.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the nature of the question asked by P.C. Quail and the
    reason given by the respondent for volunteering the inculpatory information
    about the marijuana in his trunk could attenuate the impact of the second s.
    10(b) breach on the respondent’s protected interests. Unfortunately, the trial
    judge did not take either of these factors into account in his s. 24(2)
    analysis. With respect, he erred in failing to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from these specific problems with the trial judge’s s. 24(2)
    analysis, we are respectfully of the view that in rejecting P.C. Quail’s
    evidence as to his intention to search the vehicle from the outset, the trial
    judge failed to step back and ask himself why the police would not be intent on
    searching the vehicle when, according to the trial judge, they had the lawful
    right to do so, certainly in respect of the interior, once they discovered
    ecstasy pills on the respondent’s person. And upon searching the interior, they
    would of course have found cocaine, more ecstasy pills and ground-up ecstasy in
    the driver’s door, console and dashboard of the vehicle. That, in turn, would
    have given the police the right to search the trunk, if they didn’t have it
    beforehand, and this would have led to the discovery of the gun and marijuana. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made other errors in his s. 24(2) analysis. For example,
    he placed considerable emphasis on the conduct of the police towards the
    passengers in the respondent’s vehicle and found that the police breached their <i>Charter r</i>ights in a number of respects. Those infringements, he found,
    indicated “institutional problems and support the exclusion of the evidence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the seriousness of the police conduct towards the
    passengers, the trial judge found <i>Charter </i>breaches based on this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Harris</i> (2007), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 193. In doing so, he
    failed to consider the fact that the offences for which the respondent was
    arrested occurred on July 28, 2006, more than a year before <i>Harris</i> was
    decided.  In other instances, the trial judge appeared to judge the seriousness
    of the police conduct based on standards set in subsequent cases such as <i>R.
    v. Grant</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353 and <i>R. v. Suberu</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460.
    With respect, in assessing the seriousness of police conduct for s. 24(2)
    purposes, care must be taken to judge the conduct against the state of the law
    as it existed at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All in all, we have serious difficulty with the trial judge’s finding
    that P.C. Quail would not have searched the car but for the information about
    the marijuana he received from the respondent. We also have concerns about his
    characterization of the conduct of the police and his findings that the officers
    were acting in flagrant disregard of the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> rights, as
    well as his finding that their conduct indicated “institutional problems”. Those
    findings, in our view, are undermined by trial judge’s failure to consider
    pertinent information in relation to them and his use of subsequent
    jurisprudence to judge the seriousness of the conduct of the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, we are of the view that the appeal must be allowed,
    the acquittals set aside and a new trial ordered. In so concluding, we have not
    ignored the additional issue raised by the respondent. In our view, it is a
    matter that is appropriately left for the new trial. </p>
