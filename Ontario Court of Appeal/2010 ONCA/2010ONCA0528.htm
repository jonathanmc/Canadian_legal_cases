  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a spring day in 2003, Bonnie Lewis walked out of a
    variety store and struck her head on a steel pole protruding from a truck
    parked the wrong way on the street in front of the store.  The pole was unmarked, grey and nearly
    invisible.  Ms. Lewis did not see the
    pole until she hit it.  The pole struck
    her above her right eye near her temple.  She fell to the ground, unconscious.  She suffered a serious head injury, which has left her cognitively
    impaired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the truck could not be identified, Ms. Lewis sued
    her own insurance company, Economical Mutual Insurance Company, for damages for
    personal injuries.  Both her automobile
    policy and the OPCF Family Protection Endorsement, which was additional
    insurance she had purchased, provided coverage for personal injuries resulting
    from an accident involving an unidentified or uninsured automobile.  As Ms. Lewis was not an occupant of an
    automobile when she was injured, she was entitled to coverage only if she was
    “struck by” or “hit by” an unidentified automobile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Economical moved for summary judgment to dismiss Ms.
    Lewis’ claim.  It contended that she was
    not struck or hit by the truck, or the pole that protruded from it, because the
    truck was not moving at the time.  Instead, Economical argued that it was Ms. Lewis who struck or hit the
    pole.  The motion judge agreed and
    dismissed Ms. Lewis’ claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On her appeal, Ms. Lewis submits that the motion judge
    erred by interpreting the coverage provisions too narrowly.  I agree with her submission.  She is entitled to coverage.  Whether she is entitled to damages depends on
    her being able to prove that the unidentified owner or driver of the truck was
    negligent.  I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the motion judge’s order and dismiss Economical’s motion for summary
    judgment.</p>

    raise the same issue:  was Ms. Lewis

    is an insured person entitled to coverage for her injuries; if the answer is

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge correctly found that the legislative intent of s. 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> was to alleviate the
    plight of motorists injured by drivers of uninsured and unidentified
    automobiles:  see <i>Barton et al. v. <span class=SpellE>Aitchison</span> et al.</i> (1982),
    30 O.R. (2d) 282 at p. 287 (C.A.).  As s.
    265(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)(ii)(B) covers the insured “while not the
    occupant of an automobile”, logically the same legislative intent extends to
    the plight of pedestrians injured by drivers of uninsured and unidentified
    automobiles.  The trial judge also
    correctly noted the principle that because unidentified and uninsured motorist
    coverage is remedial, it must be interpreted broadly and liberally:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Chambo</i></span><i> v. <span
class=SpellE>Musseau</span></i> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 305 at p. 308 (C.A.).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless,
    the motion judge concluded that Ms. Lewis could not invoke her insurer’s unidentified
    automobile coverage because the truck was not moving when she hit the
    protruding pole.  The essence of the
    motion judge’s reasoning is found at paras. 8-10 of her endorsement:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[8]
          The meaning of “hit” or “struck” is
    not ambiguous.  It is not necessary to
    specifically exclude individual circumstances that do not fall into that
    particular meaning such as an individual injured by walking into a parked vehicle.  It is no different than walking into any
    stationary object.  The fact of its being
    an automobile (or a protuberance from an automobile) is irrelevant to the
    occurrence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[9]
          This is quite unlike the
    circumstance of being <span class=GramE>hit/struck</span> by something hit by
    an automobile or falling out of a moving vehicle as it is the movement of the
    vehicle that applies the force that gives rise to the hit/strike.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[10]     It is also unlike the interpretation of
    “hit/struck” where a moving automobile created a peril which caused the insured
    to take evasive action which resulted in his injury.  There, the visual impact of the automobile
    caused the injury.  In the present case
    the Plaintiff did not see the pole and walked into it.  Nothing about the automobile impacted upon
    the situation.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    the motion judge stated the principle that coverage provisions should be
    interpreted broadly, I do not think that she applied this principle.  Instead, she took quite a narrow or
    restrictive view of the words “struck by” or “hit by”.  In my opinion, these words should be
    interpreted broadly, and a broad interpretation entitles Ms. Lewis to coverage
    for her injuries.  I say this for the
    following reasons.  .</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the words “struck by” or “hit by” must be interpreted in the context of the
    dominant purpose of this type of insurance coverage: to compensate victims
    injured as a result of an accident involving an unidentified automobile.  Ms. Lewis was injured in an accident with an
    unidentified automobile.  Indeed,
    Economical has recognized as much by paying her statutory accident
    benefits.  Section 2(1) of the Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule (SABS) defines “accident” to mean “an incident in
    which the use or operation of an automobile directly causes <span class=GramE>an
    impairment</span>…”  In other words,
    Economical has already accepted that Ms. Lewis was involved in an incident
    where the use or operation of an automobile directly caused her injuries.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    in ordinary parlance, the words “struck by” or “hit by” generally connote simply
    “coming into contact with”, and do not specifically ascribe movement to either
    object involved.  For example, the <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary, </i>2<sup>nd</sup> ed., defines “strike” as “subject to an impact” and defines “hit” as “strike
    against, crash into, <span class=GramE>collide</span> with”.   Accordingly, we do not normally differentiate
    between “Ms. Lewis was struck by the pole”; “Ms. Lewis struck her head on a
    pole”; and, “the pole struck Ms. Lewis above her right eye”.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    although the usual case of coverage would involve an automobile that was
    moving, I do not think that the legislature intended to exclude coverage for
    injuries resulting from contact with a stationary automobile.  If that was the legislature’s intent, it
    could have said so by, for example, limiting coverage to a person “while not an
    occupant of an automobile who was struck by an automobile, excluding a
    stationary automobile”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
    the literal interpretation relied upon by Economical is inappropriate because
    its application brings about an unrealistic result or a result that was not
    contemplated in the “atmosphere in which the insurance was contracted”:  see <i>Consolidated-Bathurst
    v. Mutual Boiler</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at p. 901. I find it hard to see any
    rational distinction between an accident where a person is struck by a
    protruding pole on a very, very slow moving truck and an accident where a
    person is struck by a protruding pole on a stationary truck.  In either case, an insured would expect
    coverage and I seriously doubt the legislature contemplated a scheme that includes
    one scenario within the ambit of coverage but excludes the other.  A literal interpretation, however, would lead
    to exactly this result.  </span></p>

    evasive action to avoid colliding with a car that almost struck him and then
    left the scene.  Mr. Talbot suffered
    injuries and claimed under his unidentified automobile coverage.   As in this case, the insurer brought a
    summary judgment motion on the ground that Mr. Talbot was not “struck” or “hit”
    by the unidentified automobile.  <span
class=SpellE>Fleury</span> J. rejected the insurer’s position because it called
    for a restrictive interpretation.  He
    wrote, at pp. 255-56:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    am therefore drawn to the inescapable conclusion that the words “if hit by an
    unidentified or uninsured automobile” are intended to qualify when other
    insured persons will be covered and that they not impose any restrictions on
    the named insured.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    am satisfied that where, as here, the offending vehicle came within inches of
    colliding with the responding party’s bicycle, thereby causing a situation of
    danger where the responding party was forced to take evasive action in order to
    extricate himself from the perilous conditions created by the offending
    vehicle, that those words should be interpreted in a broad and generous fashion
    to include the visual impact visited on Dennis Talbot.  I therefore hold that Dennis Talbot was “hit”
    or “struck” by the unidentified motor vehicle and that he was a right to
    recover from the defendant…</span></p>

    her breakfast table when the uninsured car of the defendant ran into the wall
    of her house.  The resulting sudden loud
    bang and the violent shaking of the house caused Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Tucci</span> to suffer shock, as well as physical and psychological damage.  On the insurer’s motion to dismiss her claim,
    it argued that she was not “stuck by” an automobile.  Langdon J. refused to strike the claim
    because Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Tucci’s</span> “injuries arguably resulted from
    the proximate, sensory invasion, the notional equivalent of being struck.”  </span></p>

    Association</i> (1974), 2 O.R. (2d) 70 (H.C.J.), a pedestrian was standing on a
    street corner when a car mounted the curb and struck a street sign, bending it
    over and causing it to strike the pedestrian.  Osler J. held that the pedestrian was “struck by the described
    automobile”.  He said, at pp. 72-73:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    words “struck by the described automobile”, if taken to mean only that there
    must be direct physical contact between the automobile and the person of the
    claimant, could make the possibility of recovery depend upon minute differences
    in the circumstances, entirely unpredictable, such as, for example, whether the
    claimant had been able to interpose between himself and the automobile some
    article he was carrying such as a suitcase, a box of tools or unusually thick
    clothing.  In such cases, the force of
    the impact is transmitted directly to the person of the injured party,
    regardless of the fact that he has not been “struck by” the automobile in that
    there is no direct physical contact between <span class=GramE>himself</span> and it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Here
    the force of the impact was transmitted directly to the person of the claimant
    by an object which was and which remained for the critical period in contact
    with the automobile.  The force was
    thereby transmitted directly from the automobile to the deceased.  This, in my view, amounted to a striking
    within the meaning of the policy.</span></p>

    all three cases, a narrow interpretation of the words “struck by” or “hit by”
    would have disentitled the claimant to coverage whereas a broad interpretation
    entitled each claimant to coverage.  In
    all three cases, the court recognized that a narrow or literal interpretation
    of the words “stuck by” would produce a result contrary to common sense and the
    legislative intent of s. 265(1) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>.  So too is the case with Ms.
    Lewis’ claim.  <i>Re Strum</i> is particularly instructive; indeed, I agree with counsel
    for Ms. Lewis that there is no appreciable difference between being struck by a
    street sign moved by an automobile and being struck by a steel pole protruding
    from an automobile.</span></p>

    my interpretation of these words would not open the floodgates to injury claims
    by persons who walk into unidentified parked cars.  This is a case about coverage, not liability
    or negligence.  If the owner or driver of
    a parked car was not negligent, the claimant would have no legal entitlement to
    damages.</span></p>
