style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was convicted in 1996 of second degree murder
    in the stabbing death of his girlfriend, Tracey Kelsh.  In January 2000, this court allowed his
    appeal from that conviction and ordered a new trial: (2000), <span
class=canliicitation>142 C.C.C. (3d) 401.</span>  In October 2001, after a three-week jury
    trial, the appellant was acquitted of murder but convicted of
    manslaughter.  The Crown initiated a
    dangerous offender proceeding and, after a lengthy hearing, the trial judge
    designated the appellant a dangerous offender and sentenced him to
    indeterminate custody.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant appeals both the conviction and the dangerous
    offender designation.  The central issue
    on the appeal from conviction is whether the trial judge erred by refusing to
    admit, in their entirety, out-of-court statements made by the appellant shortly
    after his arrest.  The appellant also
    contends that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury failed to deal
    properly with the burden of proof and with the defence of automatism.  Finally, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by refusing to stay the dangerous offender proceeding as an abuse
    of process.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant and the deceased were involved in a short-term
    romantic relationship.  Both were heavy
    users of cocaine and alcohol.  The
    deceased had a lengthy history of mental illness and a pattern of impulsive,
    violent behaviour. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On October 8, 1994, and into the next day, the appellant and
    the deceased were partying and consuming cocaine and alcohol.  After a violent struggle in the bathroom of
    the appellant’s apartment, the deceased suffered multiple stab wounds and other
    injuries.  The most serious and fatal
    wound she sustained was a deep cut slitting her throat.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant testified that the deceased came after him,
    wielding two kitchen knives.  She backed
    him into the bathroom and shouted bizarre statements about bikers and levelled
    accusations against him.  A violent
    struggle ensued in the bathroom.  The
    appellant testified that it was pitch dark, he was terrified and he feared for
    his life.  He attempted to take the
    knives from the deceased, managed to seize one and recalled stabbing her in the
    arm. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Neighbours living immediately above the appellant’s apartment
    heard the appellant yelling “shut up” several times and heard a female voice
    moaning in pain.  They called the police
    who arrived quickly.  The appellant and
    the deceased were still in the bathroom when the policed arrived.  The appellant resisted their entrance into
    the bathroom.  The police heard the
    appellant say “I’m going to stab/kill you”, “I’m going to stab her”, “I’m going
    to cut/slit her throat”.  The police
    heard no female voice.  They eventually
    managed to force their way into the bathroom before proceeding to subdue and
    handcuff the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Shortly after his arrest and later during the morning, the
    appellant made three statements to the police that are the subject of the main
    ground of appeal.  The first two
    statements were made very shortly after the appellant’s arrest.  The third statement was made about four hours
    after his arrest.  The first two
    statements were partially exculpatory, but largely aberrant and
    incoherent.  The third statement was
    coherent and entirely exculpatory. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Those same statements also constituted the principal ground
    of appeal against the appellant’s 1996 conviction for second degree
    murder.  At the first trial, the trial
    judge excluded all three statements.  On
    the first trial and appeal, both the appellant’s trial and appeal counsel (not
    the counsel appearing on this appeal) conceded that only portions of the
    appellant’s statements were admissible. Referring to the position taken at the
    first trial, this court stated the following, at para. 19: “Counsel did not
    seek to introduce the other statements [those at issue on this appeal] made at
    the time, conceding that they were self-serving and inadmissible.”  At that time, the appellant took the position
    that edited versions of the first two statements containing aberrant utterances
    about bikers and police trying to kill him were relevant to the issue of his
    state of mind and capacity to form a criminal intent.  Further, he argued that the third statement
    was admissible to rebut the Crown’s allegation of recent fabrication.  This court accepted the first submission and
    ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge at the 1996 trial had
    erred by excluding the statements in their entirety.  This court ruled that edited portions of those
    statements bearing upon the appellant’s state of mind were properly admissible
    as an exception to the rule against the admissibility of prior consistent
    statements.  This court rejected the
    second argument on the ground that the Crown had not alleged recent fabrication.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At the trial which is the subject of this appeal, the
    appellant urged the trial judge to admit all three of his post-arrest
    statements in their entirety.  The trial
    judge refused to do so and admitted only the edited versions of the statements
    found to be admissible by this court on the appeal from the first trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On the dangerous offender hearing, the trial judge found that
    there was compelling evidence to justify designating the appellant a dangerous
    offender.  The appellant does not take
    issue with the trial judge’s finding.  However, he submits that the dangerous offender proceeding constituted
    an abuse of process and that the trial judge erred in refusing to stay it on
    that basis. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Before trial, there were plea discussions between the Crown
    and the appellant.  The Crown offered to
    take a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the following terms.  The Crown would ask for a life sentence and
    the appellant could not ask for a sentence of less than 6 to 8 years beyond
    time served.  The appellant declined the
    proposal but did offer to plead guilty to manslaughter on condition that there
    be an open sentence hearing.  The Crown
    did not accept that offer.  The Crown
    subsequently indicated it would accept a guilty plea to manslaughter with life
    imprisonment, accompanied by a dangerous offender assessment.  Following further discussions, the defence offered
    a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the understanding that, while it would seek
    a life sentence, the Crown would not pursue a dangerous offender proceeding,
    while the defence would ask for time served.  None of these offers was accepted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>When the appellant was found not guilty of murder but guilty
    of manslaughter, the trial Crown launched the dangerous offender
    proceeding.  The appellant asked the
    trial judge to stay that proceeding on the ground that, in the light of the
    position taken by the Crown during plea discussions, launching a dangerous
    offender proceeding was oppressive and designed to punish the appellant for
    insisting upon a trial.  The trial judge
    rejected that contention and refused to stay the dangerous offender proceeding.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant’s principal ground of appeal is that all three
    of his out-of-court statements should have been admitted in their
    entirety.  He argues that there has been
    a shift in the law towards a principled approach governing admissibility, based
    upon a weighing of both probative value and prejudice.  He further contends that, under the principled
    approach, the exculpatory statements of an accused person given upon or shortly
    after arrest should be admitted where that individual testifies at trial.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant sought to introduce three statements he made to
    the police on the morning following his arrest.  The first was made in the underground tunnel
    leading to the police station.  The
    second was given some 30 minutes later, in a cell at the police station, while
    the third was made almost 4 hours later, in a hospital room where the appellant
    had been admitted for treatment of his injuries.  The first two statements contained passages
    which were exculpatory, but also portions that were bizarre and incoherent.  The third statement was exculpatory and did
    not contain the bizarre and incoherent elements present in the first two
    statements.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>These very statements were the subject of the detailed
    attention of this court on the appeal from the 1996 conviction.  On that appeal, the appellant sought only to
    introduce portions of the contentious statements.  At paras. 15-16 of this court’s decision,
    Charron J.A., (Carthy and Sharpe JJ.A. concurring), summarized the tenor of the
    three statements as follows, italicizing the portions of the statements sought
    to be admitted:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Upon arriving at the station, the appellant said “she had the knife. <i>The bikers are going to kill me</i>.  I’m telling you.” Shortly after, the
    appellant started yelling “<i>the bikers are
    going to kill me</i>. She had the knife. She was trying to kill me.” He also
    yelled “she kissed me and tried to kill me. I took the knife out of her hands.
    I got one of the knives out of her hands. She was trying to kill me. Why would
    she try to kill me? She had two knives.” </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At 8:17 a.m. the appellant further stated:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>I will testify they are going to kill me.</i> She tried to kill me. I’m done. I’m done. <i>The police are going to cut my dick off.
    They’re the ones who are going to kill me. The bikers want to kill me.</i> You
    get the knife. You will have her prints all over it. I’m telling you right now
    I could tell you guys so fucking much. I’ll tell you everything. <i>They are killing me.</i> <i>They are stabbing me. The police will tell
    you everything. Why would they do this to me? Because they are bikers. They are
    trying to kill me I’ll tell you something, I could tell you everything. Why
    would they want to kill me because they’re bikers. The police are killing me.
    They’re stabbing me. They are killing me. They are - they were the bikers. I’ll
    tell you everything. The police are stabbing me. They’re killing me.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Later that
    morning, while at the hospital, the appellant made a further statement to the
    two investigating officers, briefly stating his version of the events of the
    night.  The defence also sought to
    introduce this statement in evidence.  It
    is not necessary for our purposes to reproduce the whole statement.  It is sufficient to note that, in contrast to
    the earlier utterances, the statement appeared to be coherent and was generally
    consistent with the appellant’s testimony at trial, except that at trial the
    appellant testified that he stabbed the deceased just once.  The description of the main events contained
    in the statement reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before
    you know she pulled out two knives and got me in the hand. Somehow we ended up
    in the bathroom. I smashed the mirror. She dropped the knife. I grabbed it. I
    started sticking her with the knife everywhere. The lights were out. Why are
    you doing it? I got paid to do it. It doesn’t make sense to me. Someone was
    outside the door. They said “who is it?” I thought they were out to fuck her.
    She had one knife. I had the other. She wouldn’t stop. She kept up picking up
    pieces of glass. She wouldn’t stop. I can’t believe it.</p>

    have had no opportunity to reflect upon what was best for him to say. Clearly
    they were not. The probative value lay in the fact that the utterances appeared
    to be irrational or delusional, and hence potentially supportive of the defence
    being advanced. The passage of time, or, for that matter, the fact that there
    may have been a rational explanation for the statements, were simply matters
    going to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.</p>

    question.  In her view, the Crown had
    merely challenged the appellant’s credibility and had not, either expressly or
    implicitly, alleged recent fabrication.  In her ruling, at para. 33, Charron J.A. applied what she took to be the
    established rule against the admission of prior consistent statements in the
    following fashion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Previous
    consistent statements of a witness, including an accused person, are generally
    inadmissible because they are considered to be superfluous and of no probative
    value. The rule is based on the rationale that the credibility of the witness
    is not enhanced simply because the same statement was made before. In some
    instances, the rule does not apply. One such instance occurs when a witness’s
    testimony is challenged in cross-examination as being a recent fabrication. In
    such a case, it is not superfluous to lead evidence that the witness, on an
    earlier occasion, made a statement consistent with the challenged testimony
    because it serves to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication.</p>

    the admissibility of the appellant’s three exculpatory statements was dealt
    with in a pre-trial ruling.  The
    appellant’s trial counsel urged the trial judge to depart from the traditional
    rule excluding prior consistent statements referred to by Charron J.A. in the
    above-quoted passage, and to admit the statements in their entirety.  The appellant’s trial counsel undertook to
    call the appellant to testify in his own defence to ensure that he could not
    advance his own evidence in defence without subjecting himself to
    cross-examination, although counsel conceded that the appellant had no
    recollection of making the post-arrest statements and that they would have to
    be introduced through Crown witnesses. </span></p>

    explained that an accused’s prior consistent statements are, subject to certain
    exceptions, ordinarily excluded as hearsay and because they lack probative
    value.  The trial judge rejected the
    submission that the rule had been attenuated by subsequent decisions and
    admitted only those portions of the statements that had been found admissible
    by this court in the 2000 appeal.  As
    this was a pre-trial ruling, the trial judge only had counsel’s assurance that
    the appellant would be called to the stand and subjected to
    cross-examination.  However, as I read
    the ruling, the trial judge found that even if the appellant did take the
    stand, he could not introduce his prior statements because he had no
    recollection of making them and this would render the Crown’s cross-examination

    has come to reassess the general exclusion of an accused person’s post-arrest
    exculpatory utterances as prior consistent statements and that, in the
    circumstances of this case, the appellant’s statements made at the time of his
    arrest and very shortly thereafter should have been admitted.  He submits that the traditional “black
    letter” exclusionary rule regarding the prior consistent statements of an
    accused is not consonant with two fundamental aspects of the modern law of
    evidence.  First, such statements are excluded
    in part because they are hearsay and the law governing hearsay has been
    entirely recast in light of the principled approach, which now focuses upon
    necessity and reliability.  Second, if
    there is a “black letter” rule routinely excluding the accused’s prior
    consistent statements, it is out of step with the principle expressed in <i>R. v. Seaboyer; R. v. Gayme</i>, [1991] 2
    S.C.R. 577, favouring the admissibility of all probative evidence unless
    outweighed by prejudicial effect or some clear ground of law or policy.  Mr. Lockyer submits that the generally-held
    assumption that an accused’s prior consistent statements lack probative value
    needs to be re-examined.  He relies upon
    an established line of English case law that regards such statements as highly
    probative, finds support in some Canadian jurisprudence, and draws upon the
    findings and recommendations by the Honourable Fred Kaufman in the <i>The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy
    Paul Morin: Report</i> (Toronto: Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, 1998)
    and a growing body of scholarly opinion supporting admissibility.  These authorities all suggest that under
    certain conditions, the prior consistent statements of an accused person do
    have probative value and therefore should not be excluded. </span></p>

    the traditional “black letter rule – list of exceptions” approach to the law of
    evidence in favour of the principled approach invites reconsideration of the
    law relating to the admissibility of an accused’s  prior consistent statements.  However, in recent decisions, the Supreme
    Court appears to have maintained the traditional approach to prior consistent
    statements: see <i>R. v. Rojas</i>, [2008] 3
    S.C.R. 111, at paras. 36-37.  This is
    neither the right court nor the right case to reassess the broad issue of the

    exclusionary rule with respect to exculpatory out-of-court statements resides
    in Martin J.A.’s judgment in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Campbell</i>. In
    that case, the accused was charged with the murder of his wife. She died as a

    through a border crossing.  The accused
    argued that these statements were admissible to rebut the Crown’s allegation of
    recent fabrication.  His counsel argued
    that, upon giving his undertaking to call the accused as a witness, he should
    be permitted to elicit the accused’s prior exculpatory statements through
    cross-examination of Crown witnesses. </span></p>

    the statements at issue.  He explained
    the rationale for the exclusionary rule in the following terms, at p. 685:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The refusal of the trial Judge to admit the
    evidence of other witnesses, whether in cross-examination or otherwise, of
    previous statements made by the appellant, involves two separate rules of
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>I.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The rule which precludes an accused from eliciting
    from witnesses self-serving statements which he has previously made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The rule which provides that a witness, whether a
    party or not, may not repeat his own previous statements concerning the matter
    before the Court, made to other persons out of Court, and may not call other
    persons to testify to those statements.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Statements made by an accused which infringe rule I are excluded as
    hearsay. The narration by a witness of earlier statements made to other persons
    out of Court appears to be excluded under rule II, because of the general lack
    of probative value of such evidence, save in certain circumstances, in support
    of the credibility of the witness. Each of the above rules is subject to
    well-recognized exceptions or qualifications, and there is some overlap, both
    in the rules and in the exceptions to them: see <i>Phipson on Evidence</i>, 12th
    ed. (1976), at pp. 650-3; <i>Cross on
    Evidence</i>, 4th ed., at pp. 207-20; <i>Previous

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In rejecting the argument that the trial judge had erred by
    refusing to allow the accused to elicit the prior consistent statements through
    cross-examination of Crown witnesses, Martin J.A. identified a further
    rationale for the exclusionary rule: an accused person should not be permitted
    to advance his or her own evidence of a defence through out-of-court statements
    and avoid cross-examination.  Martin J.A.
    added, at p. 686, that even where counsel for the accused undertakes to call
    the accused to the stand, the defence should not be allowed to elicit the prior
    consistent statements from third parties before the accused testifies: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am, however,
    unable to assent to the proposition that upon counsel giving an undertaking to
    call the accused as a witness, although given in the utmost good faith, counsel
    is then entitled to elicit from third persons statements made to them by the
    accused in order to rebut an implicit and anticipated allegation that his
    evidence, not yet given, will be a recent fabrication.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The accused, of course, remains free to alter his instructions to
    counsel, or to change his mind with respect to testifying. Such an extension of
    the exception is unwarranted, would be destructive of an orderly trial and
    might be productive of mistrials if the accused did not testify after his
    self-serving statements had been introduced on the basis that such statements
    would become admissible under this exception.</p>

    [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 22, the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that the

    out-of-court statements of an accused:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>This rule is based on the sound proposition that
    an accused person should not be free to make an unsworn statement and compel

    cross-examination.</span></p>

    consistent statements of the accused, almost certainly inspired by the same
    thinking that produced the common law rule precluding an accused person from
    testifying, is the risk of fabrication.  For instance, see <i>R. v. Béland</i>,
    [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 410, citing <i>R.
    v. Hardy</i> (1794), 24 St. Tr. 199, at pp. 1093-94, and putting forth the
    following proposition: “… the presumption … is that no man would declare
    anything against himself, unless it were true; but that every man, if he was in
    difficulty, or in the view of difficulty, would make declarations for himself.” </span></p>

    admissibility of prior consistent statements: see <i>Béland</i>, at p. 411, refusing to admit evidence that the accused had
    willingly agreed to take a polygraph as “[t]o do otherwise is to open the trial
    process to the time-consuming and confusing consideration of collateral issues
    and to deflect the focus of the proceedings from their fundamental issue of
    guilt or innocence.”</span></p>

    statements of an accused are not always excluded.  Two established exceptions have already been
    mentioned.  First, where an accused’s
    prior consistent statement is relevant to his or her state of mind at the time
    the offence was committed, it may be admitted.  Second, where the Crown alleges recent fabrication, the accused may
    adduce evidence of a prior consistent statement to rebut the allegation.  A third exception is made for “mixed”
    statements that are partly inculpatory and partly exculpatory.  <span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Where the
    Crown seeks to adduce evidence of such a statement, the inculpatory portion is
    admissible as an admission against interest and, as a matter of fairness to the
    accused, the Crown is required to tender the entire statement, with the
    exculpatory portion being substantively admissible in favour of the accused: <i>Rojas</i>, at para. 37.  A fourth exception is that the prior
    statement will be admitted where it forms part of the <i>res gestae</i>, in other words, where the statement itself forms part
    of the incident that gives rise to the charge: see <i>Graham</i>; <i>R. v. Risby</i>,

    the Supreme Court of Canada stated, at p. 22, that general exclusion of the

    this case on the basis of both existing authority and the general propositions
    advanced in <i>Seaboyer</i>,<i> </i>at pp. 609-10.  If the statements are relevant and probative,
    they should be admitted: “everything which is probative should be received,
    unless its exclusion can be justified on some other ground”.  Rules of evidence that prevent the trier of
    fact from getting at the truth “[run] afoul of our fundamental conceptions of

    rule that an accused’s prior consistent statement is inadmissible “because it
    has very limited, if any, probative value and serves to expand unnecessarily
    the ambit of the trial inquiry”.  However, they went on to hold, at p. 526, that </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[t]he
    admissibility of after-the-fact conduct by an accused to support an inference
    that the accused did not commit the crime alleged should be approached on a
    principled basis. If the evidence is relevant, its probative value is not
    substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect and it is not excluded by
    some policy-driven exclusionary rule, the evidence should be received when
    proffered by the defence. </p>

    evidence should be admitted that upon arrest the accused had, before consulting
    counsel, done several things from which innocence might be inferred.  Knowing he faced an allegation of sexual
    assault, the accused volunteered to take a polygraph test (an act explicitly
    held to be inadmissible into evidence, on its own), provided samples of his
    clothing and his blood, scalp hair and pubic hair, scrapings from his
    fingernails, all while knowing that these samples would be forensically tested.
    Doherty and Rosenberg JJ.A. concluded, at p. 527, that “[a]s a matter of logic
    and human experience, a trier of fact could conclude that the [accused’s]
    conduct after his arrest was inconsistent with that of a person who had
    committed the crime alleged.”  They added
    the following, at p. 529:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Evidence
    that a person assisted the police when he was not obliged to do so and provided
    them with evidence which, if he committed the offence, could be used to convict
    him may, depending on the circumstances, be reasonably capable of supporting
    the inference that the accused had nothing to fear because he did not commit
    the crime.</p>

    accused admits the offence, then as a matter of shorthand one says that the
    admission is proof of guilt and, indeed, in the end it is. But if the accused
    makes a statement which does not amount to an admission, the statement is not
    strictly evidence of the truth of what was said, but is evidence of the
    reaction of the accused which forms part the general picture to be considered
    by the jury at the trial. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    longer the time that has elapsed after the first encounter the less the weight
    which will be attached to the denial”, and that it is for the trial judge to
    direct the jury as to the weight or value to be attached to such
    statements.  However, where an accused
    produces to the authorities a carefully prepared statement, the trial judge is entitled
    to exclude such a statement as lacking in probative value: see <i>R. v. Newsome</i> (1980), 71 Cr. App. R. 325
    (Eng. C.A.).  In <i>R. v. Tooke </i>(1990), 90 Cr. App. R. 417, at p. 420, the English
    Court of Appeal held that the test to be applied was “partly that of
    spontaneity, partly that of relevance and partly that of asking whether the
    statement which is sought to be admitted adds any weight to the other testimony
    which has been given in the case.” Canadian courts have taken a similar
    path.  See e.g. <i>R. v. Phillips</i> (1999), 123 O.A.C. 304 (C.A.), affirming a trial
    judge’s ruling excluding a statement made an hour after arrest and after the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Statements on arrest.</b>– Perhaps this exception would be better
    described as “statements made by the accused to the police when taxed with
    incriminating facts” for such statements are admissible whether or not there is
    an arrest. If they are adverse to the accused they are, when voluntary,
    admissible against him as confessions. If neutral, or favourable to the
    accused, they are admissible for the reason that</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>“A
    statement made voluntarily by an accused person to the police is evidence in
    the trial because of its vital relevance as showing the reaction of the accused
    when first taxed with incriminating facts.” [Citation omitted, quoting <i>Storey.</i>]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This means
    that such a statement is not, like a confession, received as evidence of the
    facts stated; accordingly a judge does not have to take those facts into
    account on the accused’s submission that there is no case to answer. However,
    if the accused subsequently gives evidence of those facts, his previous
    statement, made at a time before he had time to “think things out”, may be of
    the utmost importance as proof of consistency. [Citation omitted.]</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel for
    Pennett referred to authorities which would, in some circumstances, permit an
    accused to testify as to statements made by the accused after his arrest: e.g. <i>R. v. Toten</i> (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 5 at
    47-48 (Ont. C.A.);&nbsp; Ontario, <i>Report

    [1963] 1 C.C.C. 1 at 10-11 (S.C.C.).&nbsp; The admissibility of exculpatory
    post-arrest statements through the testimony of an accused raises different
    concerns than does the admissibility of those same statements through
    cross-examination of other witnesses.&nbsp; If an accused testifies, the dangers
    inherent in admitting a self-serving exculpatory statement are considerably
    reduced.&nbsp; The accused can be cross-examined on that prior statement.&nbsp;
    As I understand the appellant’s submission, it is directed at the refusal of
    the trial judge to admit the post-arrest statements through cross-examination
    during the case for the Crown. Consequently, I need not explore the
    circumstances in which a trial judge could allow an accused to give evidence of
    his exculpatory statements made upon arrest during his testimony. </p>

    an exculpatory statement made by the accused to the police shortly after the
    offence was “integral” to the defence and that respect for the right to make
    full answer and defence required its admission, provided the accused exposed
    himself to cross-examination.  Thus, it
    would be for the trier of fact to determine the weight to be attributed to the
    statement in question.  Forestell J.
    articulated the following rule, at para. 54: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>That any statement of an accused made to a person
    in authority is admissible at the instance of the accused provided the accused
    introduces the statement by giving evidence under oath in the presence of the

    accused charged with conspiracy to import drugs into Canada could lead evidence
    of her own exculpatory statement to the police within hours following her
    arrest.  In that case, admissibility was
    established on the basis that it was likely that the Crown would allege recent
    fabrication, but also because the accused had taken the stand and exposed
    herself to cross-examination:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>...all the
    reasons which justify the exclusion of evidence of exculpatory statements made
    by the accused disappear when the accused himself takes to the box. At that
    moment, the accused is then subject to full and searching cross-examination. It
    may technically be hearsay to show that on a previous occasion the accused said
    something similar to what he now says. I think that modern juries are
    intelligent enough to be able to give due weight to statements made out of
    court and I think that they are intelligent enough to be able to reach their
    assessment on the credibility to be accorded to unsworn out-of-court statements
    on the basis of their seeing and hearing and judging the accused when he or she

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In essence, the prior exculpatory statement is tendered to rebut any

    need for evidence to have probative value.  If evidence fails to add anything new, repetition is less than
    helpful.  However, where an accused makes
    a spontaneous statement in the face of an accusation or arrest for a crime,
    something is added.  The reaction of the
    accused in such circumstances may yield persuasive evidence of innocence, which
    has quite a different quality than the accused’s testimony given months or
    years later in the formal proceedings of the courtroom. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I am also of the opinion that too much is easily made of the
    risk of fabrication.  To assert blindly
    that all statements made by an accused person upon arrest are fatally tainted
    with self-interest and the motivation to lie assumes guilt and runs counter to
    the presumption of innocence: see James H. Chadbourn, <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i>, vol. 2, rev. ed. (Toronto: Little, Brown &amp;
    Co., 1979), at §293, cited in S. Casey Hill et al., at paras. 11:40.40.30. As discussed
    below at para. 97 of these reasons, this assertion is also contrary to the
    discouragement of jury directions counselling caution with respect to the
    evidence of an accused because of self-interest and motivation to say what it
    takes to secure an acquittal.  The risk
    of fabrication can be dealt with more directly and precisely through
    cross-examination and by looking to the degree of spontaneity the proffered
    statement exhibits.  Statements that are
    lacking in spontaneity may be either excluded or, in the case of doubt, made
    the subject of an instruction to the jury as to weight by the trial judge. </span></p>

    described as the “myth” that exculpatory statements made upon arrest are
    inadmissible except to the extent that they bear upon state of mind or rebut an
    allegation of recent fabrication:  “In
    the Name of Innocence: Using Supreme Court of Canada Evidence Jurisprudence to

    admit an accused’s spontaneous out-of-court statements made upon arrest or when
    first confronted with an accusation as an exception to the general rule
    excluding prior consistent statements as evidence of the reaction of the
    accused to the accusation and as proof of consistency, provided the accused
    takes the stand and exposes himself or herself to cross-examination.  As the English cases cited above hold, the
    statement of the accused is not strictly evidence of the truth of what was said
    (subject to being admissible under the principled approach to hearsay evidence)
    but is evidence of the reaction of the accused, which is relevant to the
    credibility of the accused and as circumstantial evidence that may have a
    bearing on guilt or innocence. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On the first appeal, the appellant did not challenge the
    “myth” but only challenged the exclusion of portions of the statements under
    the state of mind and recent fabrication exceptions.  This court accepted the concession, rejected
    the recent fabrication submission, agreed with the state of mind exception, and
    ordered a new trial on that basis. At the new trial, as was his right, the
    appellant refused to make the concession that had been made on appeal and
    sought to have the three statements admitted in their entirety. The trial judge
    refused to reconsider the “myth” of the exclusionary rule. Given this court’s
    decision on the first appeal in 2000, the trial judge’s ruling was certainly
    understandable.  However, on the basis of
    the analysis set out in these reasons, I conclude that as the decision on the
    2000 appeal did not decide the issue that was presented at the subsequent trial,
    the 2000 decision did not preclude the trial judge, and does not preclude this
    court, from applying the correct legal test to determine the admissibility of
    the entirety of the appellant’s three prior consistent statements.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I turn to the issue of the significance of the trial judge’s
    error in the circumstances of this case. Would the excluded evidence have been
    admitted under the legal test I have set out in these reasons? Should this
    ground of appeal be rejected pursuant to <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (“<i>Criminal
    Code</i>”), s. 686(1)(b)(iii), on the ground that the legal error did not cause
    any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The first two statements were spontaneous and made within
    minutes of the appellant’s arrest for murder.  The appellant was in a highly agitated state and he had little time to
    think or to fabricate a story.  While the
    third statement was made four hours after the arrest, it was made at a time
    when the appellant was in the hospital recovering from the injuries he had
    sustained in the altercation and the third statement was really a continuation
    of the first two statements.  In my view,
    the appellant’s three out-of-court statements may fairly be described as
    statements made by an accused person upon his arrest and upon being first
    confronted with the allegation of murder. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I do not agree with the respondent’s submission that the fact
    that the appellant could not recall making the three statements meant that he
    could not be effectively cross-examined on the facts depicted in those
    statements.  It is common ground that
    there is no fact contained in the three statements that is not also found in
    the appellant’s trial evidence.  It
    follows that admitting the statements would not introduce any fact that could
    not be fully scrutinized on the appellant’s cross-examination.  Accordingly, to the extent that the trial
    judge based his ruling on the fact that the appellant could not be effectively
    cross-examined because he could not recall making the statements, I
    respectfully disagree. <i></i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    error did not give rise to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. <i></i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, the appellant asked the trial judge to rule that he
    should be allowed to adduce evidence of the prior consistent statements before taking
    the stand, on the basis of defence counsel’s undertaking to call the appellant as
    a witness in his own defence.  In my
    view, the trial judge did not err in refusing to so rule at that point in the
    trial.  As Martin J.A. pointed out in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Campbell</i>,
    an accused person is</span><span style='line-height:
200%;color:black;'> free to alter his instructions to
    counsel or to change his mind with respect to testifying</span><span
style='line-height:200%'> up to the point of actually
    taking the stand.  Before this court, the
    appellant concedes that an accused should not be permitted to advance his own
    evidence before the trier of fact without exposing himself to cross-examination.  He further concedes that it is only where an
    accused takes the stand and exposes himself to cross-examination that he should
    be able to adduce evidence of his out-of-court exculpatory statements. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    this case, the probative value of the excluded evidence was low.  First, as I have already noted, there was
    nothing excluded that was not already contained in the appellant’s evidence at
    trial.  Second, the incoherent portions of
    the appellant’s statements were admitted, thereby reducing if not eliminating the
    risk that without knowing anything about what the appellant said upon arrest,
    the jury might have drawn an adverse inference on account of the evidence being
    excluded.  Third, the primary reason the
    appellant wanted the statements to be admitted was to show his confused and
    agitated state of mind to support his real defences to murder, namely
    automatism and lack of intent.  That
    evidence was admitted.  To the extent his
    statements did show confusion and disorientation, those very factors would
    likely have led the jury to attach less weight to the exculpatory portions of
    the statements now relied on.  Fourth,
    the excluded portions of the statements were relevant to the defence of
    self-defence and, in view of all the evidence and the injuries the appellant
    inflicted on the deceased, self-defence was tenuous at best. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For these reasons, I conclude first that the trial judge’s
    ruling would have been the same under the analysis set out in these reasons and,
    second, that even if the excluded evidence should have been admitted, there is
    no reasonable possibility that a different verdict would have ensued.  It follows that the trial judge’s legal error
    did not cause any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice within the
    meaning of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and, for that reason, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to put the
    defence position on automatism fairly before the jury by: (a) telling the jury
    to be sceptical of the defence; (b) mischaracterizing the evidence of Dr. Hill;
    and (c) failing to instruct the jury that the absence of motive had a bearing
    on the defence of automatism.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge told the
    jury that, because people ordinarily act voluntarily, they should approach the
    defence of automatism with caution as “there is a risk that an accused person
    may feign or make up such a version of events” and that “because all knowledge
    of its occurrence rests with the accused, the law in this single instance
    requires the accused to prove his involuntariness based on automatism.”</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In my view, this passage,
    which is more or less a <i>verbatim</i> quotation from the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Stone</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para. 180, simply explained to
    the jury why, in the exceptional case of the defence of automatism, the burden
    of proof rested with the accused.  Indeed,
    the law does treat automatism differently from other defences because of its
    unusual and exceptional nature.  In my
    view, the impugned passage did not mislead the jury or cause any prejudice to
    the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant complains of
    the following passage from the trial judge’s charge relating to the evidence of
    Dr. Hill, a forensic psychiatrist who testified for the defence and upon whom
    the appellant relied to make out the defence of automatism:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, there is some evidence from Dr. Hill that the sudden appearance of
    Miss Kelsh and the shock of that event may well have interfered with Mr.
    Edgar’s ability for coherent thinking or to see the big picture, as he put it.
    And that may bear on the issue of whether in fact, at the time of the event and
    the killing of Tracey Lynn Kelsh, Mr. Edgar possessed the intention for murder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In
    considering Dr. Hill’s evidence, you will remember Dr. Hill’s qualification
    that, <i>where there is evidence of memory or
    coherent thinking, that may negate an inference of disturbed thought</i>. That
    was the effect of his evidence. He didn’t quite say it in exactly that way, but
    that’s the effect of it. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that
    as his evidence was that he came in and out of consciousness, the jury could
    have understood the italicized portion of the quoted excerpt as excluding
    automatism if, at any time during the struggle, the appellant was conscious of
    what was going on. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I do not accept that
    submission. Given the overall thrust of Dr. Hill’s evidence, the way the
    defence presented its case to the jury and reading the charge as a whole, I see
    no realistic possibility that the jury could have misunderstood what Dr. Hill
    was saying: namely, that even if the appellant were in a state of automatism at
    the time he fatally wounded the deceased, he was not entitled to rely on that defence
    if he was conscious at any time during the struggle.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Finally, relying on <i>Stone</i>, at para. 191, where Bastarache J.
    stated that a “motiveless act will generally lend plausibility to an accused’s
    claim of involuntariness”, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred by
    failing to explain to the jury that the absence of a motive in the present case
    was supportive of the defence of automatism.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I disagree. <i>Stone</i> does not require such instruction
    but rather refers to motive, or the lack thereof, as a tool to be used by the
    trial judge in order to determine whether the threshold for advancing the
    defence has been met.  Here, the trial judge
    did give a general instruction as to the relevance of motive or the lack
    thereof, which, in my view, was sufficient to meet the circumstances of this
    case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, I would not
    give effect to the appellant’s contention that the trial judge failed to give
    an adequate charge in relation to the defence of automatism. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%'>4. Abuse of process</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that
    in the light of the position taken by the Crown in the pre-trial plea
    discussions, the application to have him declared a dangerous offender amounted
    to an abuse of process.  As I have
    explained, in those pre-trial plea discussions, the Crown offered to accept a
    plea of manslaughter and refrain from initiating dangerous offender proceedings
    on the condition that the Crown ask the trial judge to impose a sentence of
    life imprisonment, while the appellant would seek a sentence of not less than 6
    to 8 years beyond time served.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>We did not find it necessary
    to call on the respondent to deal with this issue which, in my view, is without
    merit.  In his ruling dismissing the
    application, the trial judge found that the appellant was fully aware that the
    plea resolution discussions had failed and that he had reached no agreement
    with the Crown concerning the sentence.  The appellant embarked upon the trial knowing full well that, if
    convicted, he could be faced with a dangerous offender application. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I agree with the trial
    judge’s reasoning.  As the plea
    discussions had failed to produce agreement, there was nothing preventing the
    Crown from assessing the case once the verdict had been delivered and deciding
    what to ask for by way of sentence on the basis of what was then known about
    both the case and the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>There is nothing in the
    record to suggest that the Crown’s efforts to resolve the case short of trial
    were not pursued in good faith or that they were improperly motivated. I do not
    agree that the Crown’s dangerous offender application can be fairly
    characterized as an effort to “punish” the appellant for insisting upon a
    trial.  From the perspective of both the
    Crown and the court imposing sentence, there may be many reasons to contemplate
    a more lenient sentence before trial than either the Crown or the court would
    be prepared to accept after trial and conviction.  A guilty plea indicates an accused’s
    acknowledgement of responsibility and may amount to an expression of
    remorse.  A guilty plea also saves both
    the financial and, for the witnesses, the victim and the victim’s family, the
    emotional cost of a trial.  A guilty plea
    also eliminates the uncertainties inherent in the trial process. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In the end, the appellant
    rejected what, with the benefit of hindsight, now appears to have been a very
    generous offer.  I see no basis in law
    that would allow the appellant at this point to, in effect, retract his plea of
    not guilty, undo the fact that he was convicted after a two-month trial, and
    claim the benefit of the very offer he refused to accept in return for a guilty
    plea.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[113]<span

    this ground of appeal.</span></p>
