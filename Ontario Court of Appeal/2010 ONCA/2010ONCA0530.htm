  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises from the appellants conviction for
    sexually assaulting PP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PP was a 17 year old young woman who had left a bad
    home life and moved in with her friend, her friends mother and the mothers
    boyfriend, the appellant.  The appellant
    was 46 years of age.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PP had a part time job in which she worked evenings
    handing out flyers that advertised a local restaurant.  About a month after moving in, the appellant
    offered to drive PP to work.  PP did not
    really want to go to work because it was raining and she had a cold.  The appellant suggested that she not work
    that evening and offered to wait for her while she told her employer that she
    could not work that night.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After telling her employer she would not be working
    that evening, PP returned to the appellants truck.  For the first time, he told her that he
    needed to stop at a house that was going to be demolished so he could pick up
    some things before going home.  The appellant
    then took PP to a vacant house, without any electricity.  The appellant had a flashlight with him.  He asked the appellant to go into the house
    with him and help carry things from the house to his truck.  While in the house, the appellant, a long-time
    cocaine addict, pressured PP to smoke crack cocaine with him.  She had not previously used crack cocaine.  She inhaled twice and felt wobbly and
    numb.  The appellant asked if she were a
    virgin and she replied that she was.  She
    felt numb and had a hard time speaking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant then engaged in sexual activity with PP.  According to PP, the sexual acts included the
    appellant licking her vagina, putting his penis in her mouth and then shoving
    his penis into her vagina and having intercourse.    PP
    testified that she did not consent to the sexual activity and could not because
    the crack cocaine had incapacitated her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PP was examined by a sexual assault nurse in the
    Scarborough Hospital the day after the sexual acts took place.  The nurse testified that she observed a tear
    in the opening to PPs vagina and slight bleeding in PPs cervix.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When confronted
    by the police with the allegation of sexual assault, the appellant said that
    nothing happened.  At trial, however, the
    appellant acknowledged that some of the sexual acts recounted by PP had taken
    place but denied that he had intercourse with her.  He testified that PP consented to the sexual
    activity or that he had an honest mistaken belief that she consented.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, expert evidence was called by both parties
    regarding the effect that crack cocaine would have had on PP.  Dr. Pelletier, the Crown expert, said that it
    was possible that PP had suffered the effects that she described.  That is, he opined that cocaine could cause
    that kind of incapacity in a first time user in strange surroundings.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rosenbloom testified for the defence.  He stated that the symptoms PP described are
    not consistent with the pharmacology of cocaine.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave lengthy reasons for rejecting the
    appellants version of events and explained why he was not left in doubt by
    it.  He found the appellants evidence to
    be inconsistent and he found that the appellant had not been candid either with
    the police or the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also gave lengthy reasons for accepting
    PPs evidence.  The trial judge stated
    that he believed PP when she said she felt paralyzed, could not move and had
    difficulty talking after having smoked the crack cocaine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then referred to the expert
    evidence.  He noted Dr. Pelletiers
    testimony that incapacity from crack cocaine could result for a first time user
    and that feelings of being wobbly, incapacitated and overwhelmed could be
    consistent with a first time user.  He
    acknowledged Dr. Rosenblooms evidence that feeling wobbly, numb and unable to
    move are not symptoms consistent with the use of cocaine.  However, the trial judge stated that he was
    not prepared to find Dr. Pelletier was wrong in his opinion that cocaine can,
    in some cases, cause incapacity in a first time user and concluded that he was
    satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the use of cocaine had had a
    numbing and paralyzing effect on PP, resulting in her incapacity to give
    consent.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the oral hearing of the appeal, the appellant raised
    a single ground, namely, that the trial judge erred in failing to adequately consider
    and deal with the expert evidence.  He
    asserts that the trial judge gave no reason for rejecting Dr. Rosenblooms
    opinion and that it was incumbent on him to do so or, at least, to explain why
    he preferred Dr. Pelletiers opinion to that of Dr. Rosenbloom.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alert to the dispute between the
    experts and he appreciated the relevance of the expert evidence to the issue of
    PPs credibility. It was open to him to reject the opinion of Dr. Rosenbloom
    and to accept that of Dr. Pelletier.  However, it is not clear that the trial judge actually preferred Dr.
    Pelletiers opinion to that of Dr. Rosenbloom.  What is clear is that the trial judge did not reject Dr. Pelletiers
    evidence that it was possible that cocaine had produced the effects on PP as
    she described.  We understand these
    comments of the trial judge as an explanation for his implicit finding that Dr.
    Rosenblooms testimony did not undermine PPs credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the trial judge erred by failing to adequately
    deal with the expert evidence, we would not interfere.  PP testified that she was unable to move or
    speak and the trial judge accepted her evidence.  Whether PPs inability was caused by the
    crack-cocaine or fear, the trial judge was entitled to accept her testimony -
    as he did - that she was unable to react.  Having rejected the appellants evidence and not been left in doubt by
    it, and having accepted PPs evidence, including that she was unable to move,
    speak or think clearly and that she did not consent to the sexual acts, the
    trial judge was entitled to find that the offence had been proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  </p>
