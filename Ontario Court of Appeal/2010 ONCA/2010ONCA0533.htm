    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of an
    imitation weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.  She was also convicted of dangerous driving
    but does not appeal that conviction.  She
    applies for leave to appeal her custodial sentence of 36 months less three
    months credit given for time while on release awaiting trial and sentence while
    on strict conditions and four days pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the appeal against conviction, the appellant
    submitted five grounds of appeal as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Her arrest was unlawful and is contrary to the <i>Charter</i> and the evidence obtained from a
    search of her car incidental to her arrest should have been excluded.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence of the two calls taken by the
    police on her cell phone which had been seized after her arrest should not have
    been admitted.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence of a police officer concerning the
    language of the drug culture used by the caller on the cell phone should not
    have been admitted.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge erred in her assessment of the
    credibility of the appellant’s mother who was a witness called by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The verdict in respect of the weapon dangerous
    was unrea-sonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the police did not
    have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest her.  The arrest was preceded by extensive police
    surveillance of the appellant based on information received from three
    confidential informants upon whom the trial judge found it reasonable for the
    police to place reliance.  Information
    from the informants indicated that the appellant was engaged in the trafficking
    of crack cocaine from a Toyota automobile owned by her mother.  The police also relied on prior know-ledge of
    the appellant’s association with known drug users and a suspected drug dealer
    in the Kitchener area.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the night of her arrest, the appellant and
    her automobile were subject to several hours of police surveillance.  During this time, the appellant was observed
    in short meetings in her car with two known crack users and two other
    males.  The trial judge accepted the
    evidence of the arresting officer that the short meetings in her car had <span
class=GramE>a strong</span> indicia of drug deals having taken place.  The trial judge concluded that the knowledge
    of the aforementioned information of the arresting officer gave reasonable and
    probable cause to arrest the appellant for possession of cocaine for the
    purpose of trafficking.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see no error in the trial judge’s
    conclusion.  The arrest was lawful and
    the drugs, the pellet gun, the cell phone and other items found in the car were
    properly admitted in evidence.  That
    said, the other grounds of appeal, even if they had merit, would not justify
    setting aside the convictions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We propose to deal only with the two grounds of
    appeal that were advanced in oral argument relating to the evidence of the
    telephone calls.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After the arrest, the appellant’s cell phone
    rang on two occasions and was answered by one of the police officers.  The caller on each of the calls was inquiring
    about the purchase of crack cocaine.  In
    our view, the evidence was not tendered for the truth of the statements made by
    the caller on the telephone but as circumstantial evidence of the nature of the
    business carried on by the appellant.  The evidence was therefore admissible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The officer, who testified as to the meaning of
    certain street terminology used by the caller on the cell phone, was an
    experienced officer in the drug investigation field.  No objection was taken by defence counsel at
    trial to this evidence and there was no cross-examination by defence counsel of
    the police officer on this evidence.  We
    see no basis to give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We turn to the sentence appeal.  The appellant argues in this court that we
    should set aside the sentence of 36 months and substitute a conditional
    sentence of two years less a day which would permit the appellant to carry on
    her successful retail fashion business, which has prospered during the period
    of time she has been on bail both before trial and prior to the argument of the
    appeal.  Counsel emphasizes that she has
    done well in other areas and has engaged in a number of community charitable
    initiatives in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.  Counsel also raises concern for the appellant concerning a bipolar
    condition in respect of which there was evidence before the trial judge at the
    time of sentencing.  However, the trial
    judge concluded the evidence in support of this diagnosis was questionable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see no basis to interfere with the custodial
    sentence.  The evidence established that
    the appellant was involved for some time in the trafficking of crack
    cocaine.  It is clear that this was a
    purely commercial enterprise.  The
    offences of which she has been convicted are extremely serious – not only the
    cocaine offence but also the offence for dangerous driving and the offence for
    possession of a weapon dangerous.  The
    sentence in this case properly reflects the need for denunciation and
    deterrence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, the appeal against conviction is
    dismissed and leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal from sentence
    is dismissed.  </p>
