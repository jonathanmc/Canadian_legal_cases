    summary conviction court to stay proceedings because police officers had
    arbitrarily detained him.  The judge
    refused to do so.</p>

    of the Superior Court of Justice sitting as a summary conviction appeal court.
    That judge also rejected the applicant’s claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unsuccessful twice, the applicant seeks an extension of
    time within which to serve and file an application for leave to appeal to this
    court where he proposes to try on the argument for a third time.  His defeats now number three.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A brief recapture of the evidentiary support for the
    claim of constitutional infringement and the basis upon which the remedy sought
    was denied furnish the essential components for the discussion and decision
    that follow.</p>
  <h3>            The Apprehension</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A police officer assigned to a festive RIDE program
    noticed the applicant turn into a nearby gas station.  The officer left the location of the program,
    went over to the gas station lot, and approached the applicant as he got out of
    his vehicle.  The officer smelled alcohol
    on the applicant’s breath. The applicant confirmed that he had consumed alcohol
    at a hockey game at the Air Canada Centre earlier that evening.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer made a demand of the applicant to provide a
    breath sample for analysis in an Approved Screening Device. The device produced
    a “fail” reading. The officer arrested the applicant on a charge of having the
    care or control of a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol in such a
    quantity that the concentration of alcohol in the applicant’s blood exceeded the
    level proscribed in s. 253(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within 90 minutes of his apprehension, the applicant
    provided two further breath samples in response to a lawful demand accompanied
    by <i>Charter</i> advice and caution.  Both <span class=SpellE>Intoxilyzer</span> readings were 130 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.</p>
  <h3>            The Detention</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arresting officer was satisfied that the applicant
    could have been released to the custody of a responsible adult after completion
    of the <span class=SpellE>breathalyzer</span> tests and service of the
    certificate and notice of intention to introduce it into evidence at trial.  But the officer-in-charge of the police
    station was of another mind.  He
    determined that the applicant would not be released, even into the custody of a
    responsible adult, until his (the applicant’s) blood alcohol concentration was
    less than the level proscribed by s.&nbsp;253(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.   Based on an hourly elimination rate of 10
    milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, the officer-in-charge fixed
    the time of the applicant’s release as 6:30 a.m., about five hours after all
    the necessary documents had been completed and given to the applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant was released on a Promise to Appear at
    7:35 a.m.  He took a taxi home.</p>
  <h3>The Decision at Trial</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge recognized the authority of the police
    to detain breath test subjects until they were sober.  The officer-in-charge was obliged, however,
    to consider alternatives to detention by taking into account all the
    circumstances, including the availability of alternative transportation for the
    applicant and his blood alcohol concentration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found no evidence about the frequency
    with which Peel Regional Police Service detains breath test subjects after
    completion of the tests, much less of wrongful post-test detention.  Although invited to do so, the trial judge
    found no support for a conclusion of any systemic practice of post-test
    unwarranted detention, or of a need for a drastic corrective response, such as
    a stay of proceedings. Where the officer-in-charge erred, in the view of the
    trial judge, was in failing to consider alternatives to detention and in
    permitting the breath test readings to foreclose consideration of any other
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather than making an affirmative and discrete finding
    of a breach of s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the trial judge assumed such a breach, characterized it as “rather minor”,
    rejected the claim for a stay of proceedings, and imposed a sentence of “time
    served” (the period of post-test detention) instead of the minimum statutory
    fine.</p>
  <h3>The
    Decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court judge accepted the
    findings of fact made by the trial judge, including his determination that the
    officer in-charge had been wrong in permitting the applicant’s blood alcohol
    concentration to be the exclusive determinant that warranted post-test
    detention. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the summary conviction appeal court judge,
    the underlying findings of fact and the remedy determined to be appropriate and
    just in the circumstances by the trial judge were conclusions open to the trial
    judge on the evidence adduced at trial.  In the result, the appeal was dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPLICATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks an extension of time within which
    to serve and file a notice of application for leave to appeal to this court
    from the decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge.  In the draft notice of appeal [<i>sic</i>] filed in support of this
    application, the applicant alleges two errors in the conclusion of the summary
    conviction appeal court.  The allegations
    are that the summary conviction appeal court judge erred in failing to stay the
    proceedings or, alternatively, in failing to exclude the results of the breath
    tests from evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an affidavit filed in support of this application, a
    legal assistant in the office of counsel for the applicant deposes: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         The
    applicant seeks to appeal the conviction on the ground that the Summary
    Conviction Appeal Judge erred in affirming the decision of the trial judge,
    wherein the applicant was granted relief from the mandatory minimum fine as a
    remedy for a violation of his rights under section 9 of the <i>Charter of Rights</i>.  The <i>Charter</i> violation stemmed from the practice of Peel Regional Police to detain
    individuals charged with drive over 80 overnight, rather than release them to
    family members.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         It
    will be argued on behalf of the applicant that given the systemic nature of the
    violation of the applicant’s rights, that a remedy of a stay or the exclusion
    of the breath readings under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter </i>was warranted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In correspondence forwarded after the conclusion of
    argument, counsel for the applicant proposed an additional ground of appeal not <span class=GramE>raised</span> in either the trial or summary conviction
    appeal court.  He proposed to challenge
    the constitutional integrity of a provincial regulation that is to come in
    force shortly.  The challenge is based on
    s.&nbsp;11(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties do not differ on the general principles
    governing applications for extension of time.  They do part company, however, on the extent to which the principles
    applicable to applications for leave to appeal under s. 839(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> may inform the
    determination about the merits of the proposed appeal.  Equally controversial are the merits of the
    proposed grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of the applicant.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Governing Extensions of Time</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No absolute rule applies to the exercise of the
    statutory discretion under s. 678(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> to extend the time within which a party may serve and file a notice of
    application for leave to appeal. In the final analysis, the principal
    consideration is whether the applicant has demonstrated that justice requires
    that time be extended.  As a general
    rule, three factors inform the decision:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          whether
    the applicant has demonstrated a <i>bona
    fide </i>intention to appeal
    within the prescribed appeal period;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         whether the applicant has accounted for
    or explained the delay in initiating
    the appeal; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       <span class=GramE>whether</span> the
    proposed appeal has merit.</p>

  <h3>The
  Principles Governing Leave to Appeal in Summary Conviction Appeals</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 839(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, leave to appeal from decisions made by judges of the
    summary conviction appeal court is granted sparingly. There is no
    one-size-fits-all standard by which to determine on which side of the leave to
    appeal line an application will fall.  But two variables dominate.  The
    first is the significance of the questions of law raised to the general
    administration of justice. And the second is the merits of the proposed grounds
    of appeal: <i>R. v. R. (R.)</i> (2008), 234
    C.C.C. (3d) 463 (Ont. C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under <i>R. (R.)</i>,
    leave to appeal may be granted where the merits of the proposed questions of
    law are arguable, even though the grounds may not be strong, provided the
    proposed questions of law transcend the borders of the specific case and reveal
    some significance for the administration of justice more broadly.  Leave to appeal may also be granted where a
    “clear” error is apparent, despite a lack of significance to the administration
    of justice generally:  <i>R. (R.) </i> <span class=GramE>at</span> <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 32 and 37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In applications for leave to appeal under s. 839(1),
    counsel make written submissions on the leave issue in their <span
class=SpellE>facta</span> and, if necessary, in oral argument.  The determination of the leave issue is made
    by a panel of three judges on the date on which the appeal is scheduled to be
    heard: <i>R. (R.) </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    38.</p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties’ oral argument focussed on the merits of
    the proposed ground of appeal that claims error in the remedy awarded by the
    trial judge, and affirmed on summary conviction appeal as appropriate and just
    in the circumstances of this case: a remission of sentence, rather than a stay
    of proceedings or exclusion of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the applicant, Mr. Breen contends that the proposed
    ground of appeal has substantial merit. A significant problem exists in the
    Regional Municipality of Peel.  Overly-refreshed drivers are routinely detained, despite reasonable
    alternative transportation arrangements, until an arbitrary reduced blood
    alcohol concentration is achieved by the application of an excessively
    conservative elimination rate to readings revealed on a <span class=SpellE>breathalyzer</span> test.  The systemic nature of the problem
    argues in favour of a more substantial remedy than awarded here, as well
    enhances the likelihood of leave to appeal being granted, although the
    likelihood of leave to appeal being granted under s. 839(1) should not be a factor
    in determining whether to extend time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the respondent, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Joyal</span> points out that the applicant proposes to argue, for the third time, an issue
    twice litigated and lost. The courts below identified the issue, applied the
    relevant and controlling principles, declined the remedy sought, and gave a
    remedy that was appropriate and just in all the circumstances.  The choice of remedy is notoriously
    fact-specific and entitled to deference.  In the result, the applicant has failed to satisfy the merit requirement
    crucial to the decision about an extension of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Joyal</span> contends,
    the factual premise on which the applicant constructs his claim that the proposed
    ground seeps beyond the specifics of this prosecution into the broader
    territory occupied by the administration of criminal justice is lacking.  Neither judge below found the systemic abuse
    that the applicant asserted.  Thus,
    nothing takes this case beyond its borders.  The lack of general application, as well of clear error, dooms the
    application for leave to appeal under s. 839(1).  In its turn, the unlikelihood of leave being
    granted means that an extension of time should be refused for want of merit.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The controversy here has to do with what might be
    termed the “merits” factor that informs the decision about an extension of
    time. In this case, the “merits” factor takes into account not only the
    intrinsic merits of the proposed grounds of appeal, but also requires
    consideration of the additional conditions imposed in cases governed by s.&nbsp;839(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks to pursue, for the third time, his
    claim for a remedy for constitutional infringement. The remedy, sought at trial
    and pursued in the summary conviction appeal court, was a stay of
    proceedings.  The applicant invoked s.
    24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, which required
    him to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that an enumerated right or
    freedom due to him had been infringed or denied and that a stay of proceedings
    was the appropriate and just remedy in all the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The infringement that the applicant alleged was an
    arbitrary detention that occurred following completion of breath tests and
    service of the certificate of analysis and notice of intention to introduce it
    into evidence at trial.  The basis for
    the claim of arbitrariness was that the officer-in-charge decided to detain the
    applicant in a holding cell, rather than to release him to a responsible party
    who could ensure his safe return home.  The period of detention was calculated by applying an arbitrary and
    conservative elimination rate to the tested blood alcohol concentration so
    that, upon release, the concentration would be less than the level proscribed
    in s. 253(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Critical to the applicant’s success at trial was proof
    of an arbitrary detention.  As I read the
    reasons of the trial judge, he made no such finding, rather <i>assumed</i> an arbitrary detention because
    the officer-in-charge had reached a conclusion open to him (detention until
    sober), but had done so without consideration of all the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the applicant sought to make out his case for
    a stay of proceedings, a remedy available only in the clearest of cases, on the
    ground that this infringement was not unique, but was rather an incident of a
    systemic abuse of constitutional rights by the local police service. The trial
    judge made a specific <span class=GramE>finding,</span> affirmed on summary
    conviction appeal, that the evidence disclosed no such systemic abuse.  The absence of the factual underpinning
    critical to the claim for a remedy available only in the clearest of cases was
    terminal to the claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge characterized the assumed <i>Charter</i> infringement as “rather
    minor”.  The summary conviction appeal
    court judge agreed. The remedy considered “just and appropriate” was relief
    from the minimum fine required by the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. The applicant does not suggest that the remedy awarded was beyond the
    reach of s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When all the cards are counted, at least as it seems to
    me, the factual findings at first instance, confirmed on summary conviction
    appeal and unassailable here, do not demonstrate an arguable ground of appeal
    as originally framed.  The claim for
    alternative relief, exclusion of breath test results as evidence, fares no
    better:  it does not appear to have been
    raised before the summary conviction appeal court.  The newly proposed constitutional challenge
    lacks traction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the applicant<span lang=EN-US>’s troubles do not end with the absence of intrinsic merit in the
    proposed ground of appeal.  There is
    more.  And what is more is the
    requirement of s. 839(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> that leave to appeal be obtained in order to have this court review a
    decision of a judge of a summary conviction appeal court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 839(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, this court grants leave to appeal sparingly: <i>R. (R.)</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    37.  Two critical variables inform the
    decision on leave to appeal: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the significance of the legal issues raised to
    the general administration of criminal justice</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>R. (R.) </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case does not require an exploration of the
    precise contours of the relationship between the factors governing extensions
    of time and those at work in determining whether leave to appeal should be
    granted under s. 839(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. Suffice it to say, however, that where the proposed grounds seem
    unlikely to warrant granting leave to appeal under s. 839(1), an applicant is equally
    unlikely to be able to persuade a judge that the proposed appeal has sufficient
    merit to warrant an extension of time. That is this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concurrent findings at trial and on summary
    conviction appeal, unimpeachable here, foreclose any claim that the legal
    issues raised transcend the facts of this case and conjure issues of
    significance to the general administration of justice.</p>
