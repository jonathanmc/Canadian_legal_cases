    appellant was convicted of second degree murder.  The deceased, Emil Uiuiu, was found in his
    car having suffered a fatal stab wound to the chest.  It was uncontested that Uiuiu had picked up
    the appellant, who was a sex trade worker, on the evening of his death and
    taken her back to his apartment.  At some
    point they had an altercation and the appellant left the apartment.  Sometime later, Uiuiu was found dead in the
    driver’s seat of his car five blocks away from the apartment.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    Crown’s theory was that the appellant had both the opportunity and a motive to
    kill Uiuiu.  Uiuiu had brought the
    appellant back to his apartment for oral sex.  Before completing the sex act, the appellant and Uiuiu had an
    altercation and the appellant left Uiuiu’s apartment, taking his chef’s knife
    with her.  When Uiuiu drove after the
    appellant to have her complete the sex act, the appellant got into the car and
    stabbed him with the knife as he was driving.  </span></p>

    defence position was that there was ample time after the appellant left the
    apartment for Uiuiu to have become involved with someone else – perhaps another
    sex trade worker – who then killed him.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal.  I find it necessary to address only three of those grounds in order to
    dispose of the appeal.  The appellant

lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the night of May 20 and the early morning of May 21, 2004, Uiuiu and John Doepel
    had gone out drinking together.  They
    left at closing time.  Doepel testified
    that when Uiuiu dropped him off at his home, Uiuiu borrowed money from him to
    hire a prostitute.  Doepel’s evidence was
    that Uiuiu would have dropped him off between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m.  It is uncontested that after Uiuiu dropped
    Doepel off, he picked up the appellant and took her to his apartment.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two
    of Uiuiu’s neighbours, both of whom lived in the same building as he did, <span
class=GramE>testified</span> about hearing an altercation in Uiuiu’s apartment
    and gave estimates of the time that it occurred.  Floyd Helka was awakened by noises that
    sounded like an altercation shortly after 1:00 a.m.   He said that the noise lasted for 15 to 20
    minutes.  Kenneth Concannon was awakened also
    by noises, but he believed this occurred around 2:00 a.m. or “two something”.  Like Helka, he thought the altercation lasted
    about 15 to 20 minutes.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    approximately 3:45 a.m., Uiuiu’s car stopped at an intersection about five
    blocks away from his apartment.  The
    vehicle was half on the road and half on the curb.  Uiuiu was in the driver’s seat and had
    suffered a single stab wound to the chest.  Expert evidence indicated he would have died rapidly from the
    injury.  Expert evidence also indicated
    that he was killed while sitting in the driver’s seat, likely by an assailant
    sitting in the front passenger seat.  There was some evidence to support the conclusion that Uiuiu had left
    his apartment in a hurry:  he was still
    wearing a condom on his penis, his shirt was only partially buttoned and his
    underpants were on backwards.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant’s DNA was found under Uiuiu’s right hand fingernail clippings, on the
    exterior of the condom and on a crack pipe that was found in his kitchen.  A strand of her hair was found on the floor
    on the front passenger side of the car.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    night before he was killed, Uiuiu’s girlfriend had washed his large chef’s
    knife and put it in the kitchen sink rack to dry.  Following the killing, the knife was
    missing.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    forensic pathologist testified that the wound in Uiuiu’s chest was most likely
    caused by a knife similar to the one his girlfriend described as missing from
    the apartment.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    July 11, 2004, six weeks after Uiuiu was killed, the police interviewed the
    appellant and showed her photographs of Uiuiu, his car and his apartment.  At first, she denied having ever seen Uiuiu,
    his car or his apartment.  She also
    denied having had any “bad dates” in the last couple of months.  As the interview progressed, however, the
    appellant clarified her statement somewhat.  She said she did not recognize the man, car or house in the photographs,
    but stopped short of saying that she had never seen them before.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From
    November 16 to 19, 2004, two undercover police officers, Detectives Turner and
    Aherns, were inserted into the Vanier Institution where the appellant was an
    inmate.  Detective Turner testified about
    several conversations she had with the appellant in which the appellant made
    statements that could be interpreted as admissions of guilt.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    November 17, for example, the appellant spoke of the charge against her and
    said, “It was one of those, let’s go and talk.  I don’t think so.”  At this point,
    the appellant made a stabbing motion towards her chest and a screeching sound
    and then said, “And I don’t mean self-defence either.”  On other occasions, the appellant said she
    was going to jail for a long time, that she was not going to confess and that
    she was not sure if someone ratted on her. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Detective
    Turner testified that the appellant “had attitude” and that she, Detective
    Turner, was “scared” of her.  The
    appellant was “intimidating” and tried “to show she was somebody, like a tough
    person”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant testified.  She admitted she
    was a prostitute and used crack cocaine on a regular basis.  She said that, on the night in question, Uiuiu
    had flagged her down.  She got into his
    car, put on her seatbelt and removed and then re-secured a rubber band in her
    hair.  She went to Uiuiu’s apartment,
    started to perform oral sex on his penis, which was covered by a condom, and then
    stopped when he became aggressive by grabbing her head and pushing her
    down.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant told Uiuiu she was leaving.  He
    threw her to the ground and started hitting her.  She screamed, struggled and eventually got
    away, but he dragged her back into the kitchen where he choked her.  Finally, she fought him off and ran out onto
    the street.  She never saw Uiuiu
    again.  According to the appellant, one
    of her crack pipes must have fallen out of her pocket during the struggle. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant said she could hardly remember the interview with the police on July
    11, 2004.  She was under the influence of
    crack cocaine at the time.  She said that
    she did not recognize Uiuiu because she tended not to look at her dates’ faces.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for the conversations with Detective Turner in the Vanier Institution, the
    appellant agreed that many of the conversations recounted by Detective Turner
    had taken place.  However, she said there
    were a number of inaccuracies or omissions in Detective Turner’s evidence.  She explained and clarified some of the
    comments attributed to her.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    essence of the appellant’s evidence was that she had not killed Uiuiu and she

    Evidence</span></h3>

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant was a sex trade worker addicted to crack cocaine.  The appellant does not object to the
    admissibility of this evidence – it is an essential part of the narrative of
    the relevant events – but argues that the trial judge failed to give an
    adequate limiting instruction to the jury with respect to it.  In addition, the appellant objects to the
    admission of a significant amount of other bad character evidence.  This evidence was introduced through
    Detective Turner (the undercover officer) and included both observations that
    the Detective made, as well as statements she attributed to the appellant.  The evidence tended to paint the appellant as
    a person who had a propensity for violence and who had little regard for the
    law.  The appellant argues that the
    evidence was not relevant to any of the issues that the jury was required to
    decide.</span></p>

    was necessary for the jury to hear all of what Detective Turner said occurred
    in order to fairly weigh Detective Turner’s evidence.  Significantly, the appellant’s counsel at
    trial did not object to any of the evidence now being challenged.  Thus, the Crown argues this should be viewed

    on the jury, a trial judge should instruct the jury as to the limited use that
    can be made of that evidence.  More specifically,
    the jury should be told not to use the evidence to infer that the accused is

    a clear instruction on the use of this evidence, the jury would engage in
    unacceptable propensity reasoning.  The

    the Crown points out that the appellant’s trial counsel did not object to the
    trial judge’s omission to give a limiting instruction.  I agree that this is a factor to be
    considered on appeal.  However, defence counsel’s
    failure to object to a trial judge’s omission to give a limiting instruction
    for evidence of this type is not always determinative on appeal.  An appeal court must look at the whole of the
    record and determine the impact of the trial judge’s omission on the fairness
    of the trial.  In the end, the trial
    judge’s duty to charge the jury properly and to ensure that the jury reaches a
    fair verdict – that is, a verdict not based on improper considerations – is not
    vitiated by the failure of defence counsel to object at trial:  see <i>R.
    v. J.D.C.</i> at para. 32.  I might add
    that in this case there does not appear to have been a tactical reason for
    counsel’s failure to object to the omission of a limiting instruction.</span></p>

    the Crown argues that the instructions that the trial judge did give with
    respect to other evidence presented at trial would help the jury appreciate the
    limited use they should make of the impugned evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to Detective Turner’s evidence, the trial judge gave instructions, both
    during the trial and in the charge, regarding the appellant’s utterances to
    Detective Turner in the Vanier Institution.  However, those instructions only addressed the reliability and accuracy
    of Detective Turner’s evidence and the potential use of the appellant’s
    statements as admissions.  Those
    instructions did not warn the jury that if they accepted the statements were
    made by the appellant, they should not be used for propensity reasoning.  Moreover, the trial judge’s instructions
    related only to statements made by the appellant.  Some of the most potentially prejudicial
    evidence from Detective Turner involved her own personal commentary – namely, that
    she was scared of the appellant because the appellant was a tough person and
    had attitude.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    although the trial judge instructed the jury, both mid-trial and in his charge,
    not to use propensity reasoning when considering two other pieces of evidence –
    specifically, the appellant’s criminal record and her possession of a knife six
    weeks after Uiuiu was killed – nothing in those instructions suggested to the
    jury that the same approach should extend to the bad character evidence.  Indeed, it is possible that the jury may have
    taken exactly the opposite message.  Having
    received specific instructions on two occasions about the limited use they
    could make of the appellant’s criminal record and the knife evidence, the jury
    may have reasoned that, in the absence of any similar instructions, no such restrictions
    applied to propensity reasoning based on the bad character evidence.  </span></p>

    the result, I am satisfied that there was a real danger that the jury could
    have used the evidence of the appellant’s bad character for propensity
    reasoning.  In my view, the trial judge
    erred in failing to provide the jury with a limiting instruction in relation to
    the bad character evidence. </span></p>

    making his ruling, the trial judge noted that the Crown was “faced with an
    attack on the credibility of its witnesses”, in particular Detectives Turner
    and Aherns, as well as an attack on the character of Uiuiu.  In his brief reasons, the trial judge seemed
    to be concerned that it was necessary to admit the appellant’s record, as he
    edited it, so that the jury would not be misled into thinking that the Crown
    witnesses were disreputable and the appellant was of good character.  In other words, admitting the record in the
    edited form was necessary to ensure that there was not an imbalance in favour
    of the appellant.  </span></p>

    trial judge seemed similarly concerned that because the appellant had brought

    jury would view him and the appellant.  </span></p>

    my view, the trial judge erred in admitting the appellant’s record of
    convictions for the four assault charges.  Those convictions would not add anything to the jury’s analysis of the
    appellant’s credibility.  The balance of
    the appellant’s criminal record, as edited, together with the other evidence that
    had been admitted about her background and lifestyle, was more than enough to
    alert the jurors that they should exercise great caution in assessing the
    appellant’s credibility.  </span></p>

    appellant’s credibility, but they were also potentially very prejudicial to her
    in terms of opening the door to propensity reasoning.  Those convictions were close in time to
    Uiuiu’s death and they portrayed the appellant as a person prone to
    violence.  While the trial judge gave the
    appropriate limiting instructions to the jury as to the use to be made of the
    appellant’s criminal record, including the assault convictions created an
    unnecessary risk that some jurors could use these convictions impermissibly.  </span></p>

    if the trial judge had removed the assault convictions from the appellant’s
    record, there would not have been an unfair imbalance in favour of the
    appellant as compared to the Crown witnesses.  As I have noted above, there was plenty of other evidence admitted at
    trial, including the evidence of Detective Turner, to show that the appellant
    was not a person of good character.  There was no need to add the four assault convictions to what was
    already a strong body of evidence on this point.</span></p>

    character.  There is a distinction.  Questioning witnesses’ accounts of events and

    judge set out the theory of the Crown.  He also set out the theory of the defence in one paragraph.  The trial judge then summarized in some detail
    the Crown’s evidence by recounting the highlights of the evidence of nearly
    every Crown witness.  However, he never
    summarized the appellant’s evidence.  Apart from a couple of small points interspersed with his summary of the

    of the two neighbours.  The appellant’s

    Uiuiu becoming aggressive during the sex act.  She said they struggled.  Eventually she was able to free herself and run from the apartment to

    said to her.  Although the trial judge
    said it was up to the jury to decide, he did not mention to the jury the appellant’s
    evidence that Detective Turner had been a far more active participant in
    eliciting conversation and in asking the appellant questions.  Given the significance of the conversations
    with Detective Turner, it was important from the appellant’s standpoint that
    this evidence <span class=GramE>be</span> left with the jury.</span></p>

    appellant took issue to some degree with several parts of Detective Turner’s
    evidence.  The trial judge recognized in
    general terms that there were differences but made only one specific comment on
    the appellant’s evidence as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Also
    there are material differences in what was purportedly said.  One was ‘and I don’t mean self-defence’.  And the accused, Ms. Bomberry said ‘I don’t
    need self-defence’.</span></p>

    summary, I am satisfied that the trial judge failed to adequately summarize the
    appellant’s evidence about what happened on the night of the killing and her
    evidence with respect to her interactions with Detective Turner.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    in commenting on the Crown’s evidence, the trial judge, on occasion, recounted
    only those aspects of the evidence that were most unfavourable to the

    examples.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    first concerns the evidence of Mr. Doepel, a Crown witness.  Uiuiu drove Doepel home the night he was
    killed and Doepel testified that on the way home Uiuiu picked up a prostitute (who
    was not the appellant).  Shortly after
    the prostitute was in the car, Uiuiu said to her, “What the fuck happened to
    your mouth, I think you should get the fuck out.”  Uiuiu was rude and the prostitute got out
    immediately.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    was potentially important evidence for the appellant because it showed a
    pattern of behaviour by Uiuiu towards a prostitute a short time before the
    interactions between him and the appellant.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    her closing submission, defence counsel referred to this evidence by saying Uiuiu
    had thrown the prostitute out of the car because she was too ugly.  Defence counsel then mentioned the comments
    about her teeth and Uiuiu’s statement about getting out of the car.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his charge, the trial judge referred to defence counsel’s submission and said: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This
    morning we heard from counsel that she [the prostitute] was thrown out of the
    car.  That is just not so and she got out
    of the car, after some smart comments, said the witness.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect, this comment from the trial judge was unfair.  Defence counsel was not suggesting that Uiuiu
    physically threw the prostitute out of the car.  The trial judge’s comment had the effect of both watering down the fair
    import of the evidence and undermining the credibility of defence counsel with
    the jury.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    second example has to do with the evidence of the police interview with the
    appellant on July 11, 2004, six weeks after Uiuiu was killed.  In recounting this evidence, the trial judge
    indicated the appellant had said “no” when asked if she had ever seen Uiuiu,
    his vehicle or his house.  She had also
    said she had not had a bad date in the past two months.  The Crown’s theory was that the appellant
    lied to the police.  However, in the
    interview with the police, the appellant had explained and qualified her answer
    to indicate that she had no recollection of having seen Uiuiu, his car or his
    house, but was not certain that she had never seen them before.  She could not say she had never been on a
    date with Uiuiu in the past.  The trial
    judge did not put the appellant’s qualification to the jury.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    third example relates to the hair evidence. A hair of the appellant was found
    in Uiuiu’s car.  The trial judge reviewed
    the Crown expert’s evidence saying </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This
    long hair could be removed on the assailant trying to leave the car and being
    pulled as he or she left, I guess, the assailant.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge made no mention of the other ways the expert had agreed that the
    hair could have ended up in Uiuiu’s car.  This was despite defence counsel’s submission during the pre-charge
    discussion about the need to include the other explanations and the trial
    judge’s assurance that he would mention the more favourable explanations.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown argues that the trial judge’s failures did not prejudice the appellant
    because the jury had the benefit of a thorough review of the evidence in
    defence counsel’s closing address.  The
    difficulty with this submission is the lack of balance in the trial judge’s
    instructions.  In some circumstances,
    counsel’s closing submissions, particularly as to the evidence, may be
    sufficient to permit the trial judge to set out the position of the parties and
    then only briefly refer to the evidence relevant to those positions.  However, when that approach is adopted,
    balance is important.  The trial judge in
    this case spent a considerable amount of time outlining the evidence that
    supported the Crown’s position and almost no time at all with respect to the
    defence evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown also argues that it would have been detrimental to the appellant if the
    trial judge had related the evidence supporting her positions because that
    evidence was so obviously flawed.  I do
    not agree.  While there may be problems
    with parts of the appellant’s explanations, she was nonetheless entitled to
    have the trial judge relate the evidence that supported her positions and then
    leave it to the jury to assess the merit of the evidence and her positions.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    the Crown points to the fact that defence counsel did not object to the trial
    judge’s charge.  I agree that the failure
    to object is a factor that needs to be considered.   However, as I said above when discussing the
    failure to give a limiting instruction in the context of bad character
    evidence, it is not determinative.  The
    trial judge had a duty to present the case to the jury in a fair and balanced
    manner.  For the reasons indicated above,
    it is my view that his charge did not meet the requisite standard of fairness.</span></p>

    do not think this is a proper case to apply the <i>proviso</i>.  I agree that the
    Crown’s case, which was based on circumstantial evidence, was strong.  However, I have concluded that the trial
    judge made three errors, each of which could potentially result in a new
    trial.  This court must take into
    consideration the cumulative effect of those three errors.  Moreover, in this case the appellant
    testified and denied guilt.  Her
    credibility was a central issue in the trial.  I cannot say that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would
    necessarily have convicted the appellant.  </span></p>
