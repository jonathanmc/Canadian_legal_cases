  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  This appeal arises from a dispute over a
    publishing agreement.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The plaintiff Societies (the “Societies”) are
    non-profit organizations that promote hearing care and the audiological
    profession, and advocate for the hearing impaired.  The defendant, B.C. Decker Inc., (“Decker”) is
    an academic publisher that focuses on medicine, the health sciences and
    dentistry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The Societies each had their own academic
    publication, one of which was published by Decker.  In 2001, the Societies decided to combine
    their efforts and produce a single journal.  They distributed a Request for Proposal (“RFP”) to a small group of
    publishers, including Decker.  The RFP
    estimated that there were 1100 institutional and individual subscriptions for
    the Societies’ publications.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The contract was awarded to Decker and
    finalized on October 25, 2001 (the “Agreement”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The Agreement spanned a three-year period,
    starting January 2002.  Decker was
    granted the exclusive right to print, promote, sell and distribute the journal.  Under the terms of the Agreement, Decker was
    to give the Societies an educational stipend and a share of the net proceeds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  Clause 3(c) of the Agreement obligated the Societies
    to give Decker certain information.  That
    clause is central to the dispute between the parties.  It reads as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3(c)  The Societies agree to provide Decker by
    September 1, 2001 with complete lists of current subscribers to their
    respective journals in both print and electronic form.  <i>These
    lists shall include no fewer than thirteen hundred (1,300) institutional
    subscribers in the aggregate. </i>[emphasis
    added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The Societies gave Decker a consolidated list
    of 1,346 institutional and individual subscribers.  Some of the names on the list were duplicates
    with the result that the list gave only 951 unique subscribers - 758
    institutional and 193 individual.  The
    journal was not financially successful and Decker did not fulfill its financial
    obligations to the Societies.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The Societies brought an action under the
    simplified procedure to recover the amount they alleged that Decker owed them
    pursuant to the Agreement.  They argued
    that there was a mutual mistake in clause 3(c), such that the clause should be
    rectified to read, “These lists shall include no fewer than <u>thirteen hundred
    (1,300) institutional and individual subscribers</u> in the aggregate”.  The Societies submitted that this number
    included duplicates. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  Decker defended on the basis that it was
    excused from its obligation to pay the Societies because the Societies breached
    the Agreement by providing the names of significantly fewer than 1300
    institutional subscribers.  This breach,
    it was argued, made it impossible for Decker to generate the revenue required
    to fulfill its financial obligations.  In
    addition, Decker counterclaimed for $150,000, claiming that the Societies had
    negligently misrepresented the number of subscribers for their
    publications.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found Decker liable and awarded
    $48,895.28 in damages.  He dismissed the
    counterclaim and ordered Decker to pay the Societies $87,805.28 in costs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Decker appeals and seeks leave to appeal the
    costs order.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge gave detailed, cogent reasons
    for finding that the wording in clause 3(c) reflected a mutual mistake and that
    rectification was the appropriate remedy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the parties had intended
    that the Societies would provide the names of 1300 subscribers, and that this
    number would include both institutions and individuals.  He gave the following reasons for this finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b> Rectification is consistent with the dealings
    between the parties:</b>  Both the e-mail
    correspondence between the parties and the RFP distinguished between
    institutional and individual subscribers.  One e-mail from the Societies noted that they expected 1100 names, with
    an 80:20 split between institutional and individual subscriptions.  Another e-mail indicated that the Societies
    had “merged and purged” their subscriber lists into approximately 1100
    institutional and individual subscribers. The RFP distinguished between the two
    groups and indicated that the Societies were not able to ascertain exactly the
    split between institutions and individuals.  Mr. Decker’s testimony that his understanding that clause 3(c) was to
    relate only to institutional subscriptions did not make good business
    sense.  Individual subscribers are a
    source of revenue.  Decker must have
    expected the Societies would also name their individual subscribers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b> Decker would have been aware that the
    Societies did not have 1300 institutional subscribers:  </b>it would have been obvious from an
    examination of the lists provided by the Societies before the Agreement was
    signed that subscribers were both individual and institutional.  Decker would have known, from its lengthy
    experience in the publishing business, that academic journals of this nature
    depended on both classes of subscriptions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b> Decker’s post-Agreement conduct is consistent
    with rectification:  </b>  there was no complaint at the time that the
    Societies provided the list.  Furthermore, when the dispute first arose, Decker did not allege the
    Societies were in breach of the Agreement because they had failed to provide a
    list of 1300 institutional subscribers.  Rather, in an e-mail dated January 15, 2003, Decker asserted that there
    had been a shortfall in subscription revenues from “non-member individuals and
    institutions”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b> Decker’s own documents support
    rectification:  </b>Decker’s Pro Forma
    Income Statement, attached to the Agreement, indicates that it projected future
    income based on receiving 200 individual and 735 institutional subscribers, not
    1300 institutional subscribers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge rejected Decker’s evidence that
    it expected to receive a list of 1300 institutional subscribers.  The Societies provided Decker with “1346
    individual and institutional subscribers in the aggregate, meaning that there
    might have been and probably were duplicated names in this number.  However, that was contemplated by the
    parties' use of the term ‘in the aggregate’ in clause 3(c).”  The Societies provided the list of
    subscribers in time for Decker to promote the new journal in the fall of 2001.  “It is significant that the lists provided by
    the [Societies] ... have never been produced by [Decker] either prior to or at
    trial.  ... The court must draw an
    adverse inference from this lack of production of material documents on the
    part of [Decker].”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Decker’s complaint that it did not receive the
    lists before September 1, 2001, as required by the Agreement, is undermined by
    the fact that it did not sign the Agreement until October 25, 2001.  Further, Decker did not provide notice of
    this alleged breach as required by clause 19 of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also gave thoughtful, detailed
    reasons for dismissing the counterclaim.  He noted that the RFP was couched in language that was merely suggestive
    that the Societies could provide 1100 non-overlapping subscriptions and found
    that this language would not mislead Decker, which had a “wealth of experience
    in this field of endeavour”.  Further, he
    held that it was Decker’s responsibility to examine the materials that the
    Societies had provided and raise any concerns it might have had before entering
    into the Agreement.  He found that Decker
    either did not perform that analysis or, if it did, that Decker did not advise
    the court of the results of such an analysis.  He stated that “The failure to produce the relevant documents must give
    rise to a negative inference that the documents in question do not support
    [Decker’s] position”.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the oral hearing of the appeal, Decker
    pursued only one ground of appeal, namely, that the trial judge’s determination
    in respect of rectification cannot stand in light of <i>Sylvan Lake Golf &amp; Tennis Club Ltd. v. Performance Industries Ltd.</i>,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If granted leave to appeal the costs order,
    Decker would argue that the amount of the costs order is unreasonable because
    it greatly exceeds the damages awarded to the Societies, fails to reflect the
    reasonable expectations of the losing party and fails to recognise that costs
    awarded under the simplified procedure must be proportionate to the amount recovered
    in the claim. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>RECTIFICATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    court found it unnecessary to call on the respondent on this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Sylvan Lake</i>, at para. 29, the Supreme
    Court of Canada stated that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>When
    reasonably sophisticated business people reduce their oral agreements to written
    form, which are prepared and reviewed by lawyers, and changes made, and the
    documents are then executed, there is usually little scope for
    rectification.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Decker
    relies on this statement to argue that the trial judge erred in ordering
    rectification in the present case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    disagree.  In <i>Sylvan Lake</i>, at para. 31, the Supreme Court affirmed that the
    equitable remedy of rectification for mutual mistake remains and that the
    court’s task is corrective, to restore the parties to their original bargain
    and not to belatedly rectify an error in judgment by one party.  In light of the findings of the trial judge,
    it is clear that he followed the dictates in <i>Sylvan Lake</i>.  He found that,
    as a result of mutual mistake, the parties’ original bargain was not reflected
    in clause 3(c) of the Agreement.  He
    satisfied himself as to what the common intention was and rectified the clause
    so that it reflected the parties’ original bargain.  In so doing, the trial judge relied on the
    findings that he had made, which were fully open to him on the record.  He did not engage in speculation about what
    the original bargain might have been nor did he attempt to rectify a bad
    bargain.     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE COSTS ORDER</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Societies submit that leave to appeal the
    costs order ought not to be granted.  They note that the test for leave to appeal costs orders is a stringent
    one and argue that Decker has not established strong grounds on which this
    court could find that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While leave to appeal a costs order is to be
    granted sparingly, in my view, leave is warranted.  In setting costs, the courts must keep in
    mind what is fair and reasonable: see <i>Boucher
    v. Public Accountants Council (Ontario)</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at
    paras. 37-38. Given that the amount of the costs order is significantly more than
    the amount that the Societies sought by way of damages and that the action proceeded
    by way of simplified procedure, the reasonableness of the quantum is called
    into question and leave is warranted.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge gave detailed, thoughtful
    reasons for the costs order.  He began
    his analysis by reminding himself of the governing principles in fixing costs,
    including the “overriding principle of reasonableness” and the need to
    determine what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.  He properly noted that cost awards under the
    simplified procedure should generally be significantly lower than what they
    would have been under the ordinary procedure and that they must be reasonable
    and proportionate to the amount in dispute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the Societies’ offer
    satisfied the requirements of rule 49(10).  He did not automatically apply rule 49.10, however.  Rather, he followed <i>Culligan Springs Ltd. v. Dunlop Lift Truck (1944) Inc.</i> (2006), 211
    O.A.C. 65 (Div. Ct.), and treated the offer as an important – but not
    determinative – factor in fixing costs.  He then reviewed the factors in rule 57.01, with reference to the
    objective of the simplified procedure, namely, to promote affordable access to
    justice.  In so doing, he looked at the rates
    charged and hours that had been spent by counsel for the Societies.  He found them to be necessary and reasonable.  Although the action had been conducted under
    the simplified procedure rules, the trial judge observed that it was not
    uncomplicated and, in addition to prosecuting their own action, the Societies
    were required to defend Decker’s counterclaim for $150,000, a claim that had
    “no merit”.  In addition, the trial judge
    noted that the action spanned a period of almost four years, involved a number
    of motions and required the Societies to bring in witnesses from outside
    Ontario.  As the trial judge observed,
    both parties would have been aware that the dispute was costly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While both parties had estimated a week-long

    writing, were made over several months.  </p>

    that much of the delay in proceeding was due to Decker.  He found that Mr. Decker – Decker’s
    controlling mind – was a highly intelligent, learned and successful businessman
    who “stubbornly advanced a position that was implausible and which was
    unsupported by the documentary materials that were uniquely in [Decker’s]
    possession”.  He must be “taken to have
    known and understood the risks inherent in the positions being advanced on
    Decker’s behalf.”  The trial judge also
    found that documents in Decker’s possession that ought to have been produced
    had never been produced, for unexplained reasons, and this prolonged the
    duration of the trial.  “Its
    intransigence cannot be rewarded nor condoned, particularly at the expense of
    the plaintiffs.” </p>

    that the Societies’ Bill of Costs was reasonable, not out of proportion to what
    was at stake and did not violate the objectives of the simplified procedure
    provisions.         </p>

    by this court. </p>
