  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault and
    unlawful confinement in relation to an incident involving the complainant, his
    13 year old neighbour.  Both the
    appellant and the complainant testified at trial.  <span lang=EN>They
    gave different versions of the relevant events.&nbsp; The trial judge
    ultimately accepted most of the complainant’s evidence, and said that he was
    satisfied on the totality of the evidence that the Crown had proved its case
    with respect to the sexual assault and the unlawful confinement charges.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    anchors his appeal to this court by asserting that the trial judge committed
    reviewable error, particularly in light of the Supreme Court of Canada
    decisions in <i>R. v. W.(D.), </i>[1991] 1
    S.C.R. 742<i> </i>and <i>R. v. C.L.Y.</i><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 5.  I agree with the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I read the
    trial judge’s reasons as committing two errors:  First, in order to establish the credibility of the complainant, the
    trial judge assumed the appellant’s guilt.  Second, the trial judge does not appear to have given sufficient
    consideration to the third branch of the <i>W</i><i>.(</i><i>D.)</i><i> </i>analysis – that despite disbelieving the
    evidence of the accused, the Crown evidence did not establish guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p><span> </span><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 13 year old complainant testified that he was
    playing hockey alone on his driveway for about half an hour when his next door
    neighbour, the appellant, called him over.  The complainant had never talked to the appellant before, but he dropped
    his hockey stick and walked over to the front door of the appellant’s home to
    speak with the man.  He thought the
    appellant had wanted to ask him a question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As soon as the complainant got there, he says that the
    appellant forced him inside the home, took him to a bedroom and “humped” him
    for a couple of minutes.  The complainant
    described the appellant as forcing him to lie down on his back and, without
    removing either his or the complainant’s clothes, standing at the foot of the
    bed and rotating his hips back and forth toward him.  The appellant then lay on top of the
    complainant and made the same motion while kissing his neck and asking him
    three times if he loved him.  The appellant
    then stood the complainant up and hugged him several times, again kissing his
    neck and asking him if he loved him.  In
    an interview with police, the complainant claimed that the appellant then
    walked the complainant out to the front door and told him to, “[g]o tell your
    parents.  Go get your parents and come
    back to me.”  He later changed this
    element of the story, saying that the appellant told him to, “[t]ell your
    parents to stop bugging us.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant categorically denied the
    allegations.  His position on the
    evidence was that malice on the part of the complainant’s family had prompted
    the false complaint.  Other members of
    the appellant’s family also testified to various disputes that had occurred
    between the respective families over the years.  In particular, there was evidence that the
    complainant’s parents had used racial epithets to address and describe the
    appellant and his family, and that his father had threatened to do whatever
    necessary to get them out of the neighbourhood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
    appellant was convicted of sexual assault and unlawful confinement.  On the charge of sexual assault, he was
    sentenced to 90 days custody to be served intermittently.  On the unlawful confinement charge, he was
    sentenced to three months, which was to be served concurrently and in the
    community. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN> </span><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court Canada decision in <i>W.(D.)</i> is the seminal authority on
    defining the burden of proof in criminal trials.  It sets out a three stage analysis to be
    included in jury instructions, and w<span lang=EN>hile the steps are familiar and often recited in decisions, they are worth
    restating as it would, in my view, have been helpful to apply them in the
    circumstances of this case</span>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>First, if the trial judge believed the evidence of
    the appellant, he must be acquitted.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Second,
    if the trial judge did not believe the evidence of the appellant, but was left
    in reasonable doubt by it, then again, he must be acquitted.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Third, even if the trial judge was not left in
    doubt by the evidence of the appellant, he was then required to decide whether,
    on the basis of the evidence he did accept, he was convinced beyond a
    reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the appellant.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three stage analysis in <i>W.(D.) </i>is frequently cited for the proposition that a criminal
    trial is not a contest of credibility between the accused and the complainant;
    that disbelieving the accused does not lead necessarily to conviction.  <span lang=EN>As
    Fish J. describes it at para. 25 of </span><i>C.L.Y.</i>, <span lang=EN>“[t]he <i>very purpose</i> of
    adhering to the procedure set out in <i>W.(D.)</i> is to foreclose an
    inadvertent shifting of the burden of proof where the complainant and the
    accused have both testified and the outcome of the trial turns on their
    credibility as witnesses.” (emphasis in the original)  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>C.L.Y.</i>,
    the Supreme Court revisited the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis, and was divided on how strictly it should be applied.  In that case, the trial judge had reviewed
    the evidence of the complainant and concluded that she believed it before
    considering the evidence of the accused.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Writing in dissent, Fish J. found that the trial judge
    had committed a reviewable error.  In his
    view, the trial judge had found the accused guilty before even evaluating his
    evidence, and thus shifted the burden to the accused.  As he stated at para. 30 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unfortunately, the
    appellant’s presumption of innocence had by that point been displaced by a
    presumption – indeed, a <i>finding </i>– of
    guilt.  The trial judge could hardly
    believe <i>both </i>the appellant <i>and </i>the complainant.  Before even considering the appellant’s evidence,
    she had already concluded that she believed the complainant.  In effect, the trial judge had thus decided
    to convict the appellant unless his evidence persuaded her to do otherwise. (Emphasis
    in the original)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the majority stressed that <i>W.(D.)</i> need not be “religiously
    followed” and saw, “no blue print for error in the trial judge’s failure to
    observe <i>W.(D.)</i> as a catechism”:
    paras. 7 and 11.  Central to the
    majority’s reasoning was Abella J.’s conclusion at para. 12 that the mere order
    in which the trial judge had reviewed the evidence and stated her conclusions
    did not, of necessity, create a shift in the burden of proof:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge’s reasons
    reveal that she understood that a finding that the [complainant] was credible
    did not mean that the onus shifted to the accused to show that he was not
    guilty.  I find it difficult to see how
    the sequence in which the trial judge set out her findings of credibility can
    be said to undermine her articulated and correct statement of the law, or demonstrate
    that she lost sight of a paramount legal principle like reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Significantly both the majority and dissent
    agreed that it would be an error for a trial judge to find that because a
    complainant was credible, the onus shifts to the accused to disprove his
    guilt.  What separated the majority and
    dissent was the majority’s finding that there was nothing to suggest that this
    error had been committed, while the dissent found that it had been and that following
    the structure of <i>W.(D.)</i> would have
    guarded against such error: per Fish J. at para. 31.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In
    considering issues around the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis, trial judges are presumed to know the law regarding the presumption
    of innocence and the burden of proof.  They are not required to explain in detail the process they followed to
    reach a verdict; they only need to give reasons that the parties can understand
    and that permit appellate review: <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.  </span></p>

    would add that it is also essential to keep in mind the comments of Fish J. at
    para. 33 in <i>C.L.Y.</i>:  “[J]udges may know the law, yet err in its application; they may know the facts, yet make findings of credibility unsupported by the record.  What matters in either instance is the substance and not the form of the decision.”</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the trial judge’s reasons are
    quite similar to those that were under review in <i>C.L.Y.</i>   The trial judge in
    the present case reviewed the testimony of the complainant and found him to be
    “a compelling and credible witness.”  He
    next reviewed the testimony of the appellant, which he rejected as
    fabricated.  Finally, based on these
    conclusions, but primarily on the credibility of the complainant, he found the
    appellant guilty.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I fully appreciate that pursuant to <i>C.L.Y.</i>, the mere order in which he stated
    these conclusions is not sufficient to ground a finding that he shifted the
    burden from the Crown to the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, I find that a shift in the burden of
    proof from the Crown to the defence did occur in this case.  My reasons for so finding go beyond the mere
    sequence of the conclusions.  Furthermore, as I noted earlier, I read the trial judge’s reasoning as
    giving insufficient consideration to the third prong of the <i>W.(D.) </i>analysis – the possibility that
    the trial judge would disbelieve the defence but still find that the Crown had
    not proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>            Presumption of
    Innocence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge shifted the burden to the
    accused in two respects.  First, in
    discussing the complainant’s credibility, the trial judge appears to have
    reversed the presumption of innocence, and dismissed one of the key challenges
    to the complainant’s credibility by presuming the guilt of the appellant.  Second, the trial judge’s reasons appear to
    suggest that, having found the complainant credible, he then shifted the burden
    to the appellant to disprove the allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, the complainant had testified that the
    appellant, after molesting him, had said either, “Go tell your parents.  Go get your parents and come back to me” or
    “Tell your parents to stop bugging us.”  The defence argued that such statements were simply too bizarre to be
    believable.  In evaluating this argument,
    the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As Miss Paradis
    correctly pointed out, these comments, singularly or collectively, are
    odd.  Why would a person who has
    committed an assault of this magnitude tell the complainant to go and tell his
    parents?  Yet, in the face of what
    allegedly happened itself being at the very least odd, these circumstances and
    those utterances are understandable.  If
    the events happened as alleged, they are the product of someone who was clearly
    not behaving rationally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the trial judge’s own reasoning, the
    Crown’s case was tied inextricably to the credibility of the appellant.  At this stage of his reasoning, the trial
    judge was addressing one of the defence’s key bases for arguing that the
    complainant was not credible.  Yet his
    dismissal of this argument, as I will illustrate, required assuming that the
    appellant was guilty.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasoning in respect of this defence
    argument seems to be as follows: The statements were bizarre, which raises
    issues of credibility.  However, if the
    accused did commit such a bizarre crime then he would be the type of person to
    make such a bizarre statement.  This
    reasoning is circular in that it assumes its own conclusion. Establishing the
    guilt of the accused required establishing the credibility of the
    complainant.  Yet, in order to establish the
    credibility of the complainant, the trial judge first assumed that the accused
    was guilty.  That is, in order to find
    that the statements are odd but understandable (i.e. that they were made and
    the complainant is telling the truth) the trial judge first had to find that
    the assault occurred (i.e. that the accused was guilty).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent this circular logic, the trial judge’s reasons
    provide no answer to the question he posed to himself: Why would a person who
    has committed an assault of this magnitude tell the complainant to go and tell
    his parents?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The way in which the trial judge rejected the evidence
    of the appellant suggests to me that he committed the error described in <i>W.(D.)</i> of finding guilt based on his
    disbelief of the appellant.  The trial
    judge noted at several points that the defence theory that the complainant, in
    collusion with his family, had concocted the story in order to force the
    appellant from the neighbourhood was not credible.  In particular, at p. 21 he states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In reviewing his
    evidence in its entirety and bearing in mind the discrepancies to which I have
    alluded, they do not dissuade me from the view I hold that [the complainant]
    was a compelling and credible witness.   With respect, it is simply not plausible that he fabricated this
    intricate version of events as part of some family plot to rid them of the
    neighbours.  He is, after all, 13 years
    of age.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This passage is troubling in that the trial judge
    appears to rely on the following line of reasoning:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The complainant is a credible witness.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has put forward no credible
    explanation for his allegations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore the allegations are proven.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This line of reasoning necessarily implies that the
    trial judge, having decided that the complainant was credible, then shifted the
    burden to the defence to refute his allegations.  This is precisely the kind of reasoning that
    the majority in <i>C.L.Y.</i> found at para.
    12 would be impermissible: A finding that the complainant was credible did not
    mean that the onus shifted to the appellant to show that he was not guilty.  In other words, the appellant did not have an
    obligation to put forward a theory that would explain why the complainant would
    make a false complaint.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This reasoning
    leads me to conclude that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof from the
    Crown to the defence.  This error, I
    find, goes beyond the mere sequence of the conclusions of the trial judge.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>            Reasonable Doubt</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to this shift of the burden of proof, the
    trial judge did not adequately consider the third step in the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis – that although he
    completely disbelieved the accused, the Crown had nonetheless failed to
    establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  There are two excerpts from the trial judge’s reasoning which demonstrate
    this error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the above quoted statements attributed to the
    appellant were not important simply because they were odd.  They also showed evidence of the
    complainant’s story evolving in order to become more believable.  The defence noted that in the complainant’s
    first statement to police he reported that the appellant had said, “Go tell
    your parents.  Go get your parents and
    come back to me.”  But that in his second
    statement, this changed to, “Go tell your parents to stop bugging us.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence posited that this change was to make the
    complainant’s story more believable and may have been prompted by the
    investigating officer.  In cross
    examination, the following exchange took place between defence counsel and the
    complainant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Well,
    he didn’t say go get your parents did he?  You didn’t say go get your parents on October 4<sup>th</sup>, you said…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Go tell my parents.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        … go tell your parents to stop bugging us,
    right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yeah</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Do you think that’s the same thing?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        No.  Okay.  So did that change because
    the officer didn’t think it made much sense?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yeah.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant later changed his position and denied
    that the change was made in response to the officer’s belief that the first
    statement did not make sense.  The Crown
    has argued that this may have been due to the stress of cross examination or
    the complainant’s not understanding the line of questioning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The salient point, however, is that the trial judge did
    not address this exchange or explain why it did not raise any doubts in his
    mind as to the credibility of the complainant.  Again, I would observe that at this stage of the analysis, the trial
    judge had already stated conclusively that he found the complainant credible
    and compelling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the trial judge accepted that
    there was a great deal of animosity between the appellant and the complainant’s
    family.  The complainant testified that
    he and members of his family had referred to the appellant as a “fucking Paki.”  The complainant’s mother admitted that she
    had accused the appellant of being a “fucking pedophile” in the months before
    the complainant’s allegations.  Both
    testified that they felt that the appellant stared at their family in
    inappropriate ways.  The mother testified
    that they had enlarged the fence between the properties and the appellant
    testified that they had piled snow in the appellant’s basement windows to
    prevent this staring.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, it was not necessary to find
    that there had been a well articulated “plot” to fabricate allegations.  The trial judge did not turn his mind to the
    possibility that the complainant, living in such a strained atmosphere and with
    such accusations already in the air, may have spontaneously accused the
    appellant of “humping” him.  Such a
    possibility is especially troubling given two aspects of the allegations.  First, as noted by the defence, the action
    described by the plaintiff, while not only bizarre, do not seem consistent with
    those of a person seeking sexual gratification.  They do, however, seem to reflect a child’s understanding of what a
    pedophile would do to a young boy.  Second, the evidence discussed above with
    respect to the appellant’s telling the complainant to tell his parents suggests
    that the complainant’s story appears to have evolved over time in order to
    become more coherent.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find that the trial judge erred in not explaining why
    these factors did not raise a reasonable doubt that the accusations may have
    been fabricated.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the conviction and order a new trial. </p>

    reasons for judgment. With respect, I am unable to agree with my colleague’s
    analysis or conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave comprehensive reasons for
    judgment. He reviewed the pertinent evidence, addressed the arguments put
    forward on behalf of the appellant, resolved most of the troubling features of
    the complainant’s evidence, and explained why, on the whole of the evidence, he
    believed the complainant and disbelieved the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the trial judge came to a
    conclusion about the complainant’s credibility before considering and rejecting
    the appellant’s evidence, that is a matter of form, not substance, and it does
    not amount to reviewable error. Nor was it wrong for the trial judge to reject
    the appellant’s evidence on the basis that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the complainant was telling the truth. In arriving at that
    conclusion, the trial judge considered the whole of the evidence, he addressed
    the key issues raised by the defence and in the end, he resolved the
    contentious issues in favour of the Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a nutshell, the defence contended that the
    complainant’s evidence was a complete fabrication, that he never set foot in
    the appellant’s home and that his story was the product of a conspiracy,
    formulated by him and his bigoted parents, to rid the neighbourhood of the
    appellant and his family. The trial judge summarized the conspiracy theory put
    forward by the appellant as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. [Y.] categorically denies the assertions that
    [the complainant] made. It is a principal contention of the defence that the
    complaint was fabricated not only by [the complainant] but in consort with his
    parents so as to force the accused and his family from the neighbourhood. It
    was suggested by the defence that the [complainant’s] family was prejudiced
    against the [Y.’s], their neighbours. They were accused of being frequently
    abusive and assaultive and it is alleged that they had threatened the accused
    and his father that they would do whatever they could to get them, being the
    [Y.’s] and the accused, out of the neighbourhood. Most of the criticism was
    directed at [the complainant’s] father, ... who was not a witness in this
    proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the conspiracy theory and
    rejected it, at least insofar as it purported to sweep in the complainant.
    While the trial judge accepted that there was “bad blood emanating” from the
    complainant’s parents towards the appellant and his family, he found that there
    was “no evidence that [the] complainant] himself played any role in this
    phenomena.” In the trial judge’s view, “it was simply not plausible that [the complainant]
    fabricated this intricate version of events as part of some family plot to rid
    them of the neighbours. He is, after all, 13 years of age.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That finding – that the complainant played no role in
    his parent’s hostility towards the appellant – is amply supported by the
    evidence and it is central to the trial judge’s overall assessment of the case
    and his credibility findings in favour of the complainant.  If it did not decimate the defence position,
    it severely weakened it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the conspiracy theory off the table, the remaining
    question for the trial judge was whether the event described by the complainant
    actually occurred, or whether it was something the complainant conjured up in
    his mind for some inexplicable reason. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence took the position that the complainant’s
    testimony was incredible and unreliable and it should not be believed. The
    allegations of sexual misconduct attributed to the appellant were bizarre and
    strained the bounds of credulity. The same held true for the message the complainant
    says he was told to convey to his parents.  In addition, the complainant’s evidence suffered from inconsistencies
    and other failings, such as his inability to more fully describe the interior
    of the appellant’s home and the bedroom in which the sexual misconduct is said
    to have occurred. Viewed as a whole, the complainant’s evidence could not
    safely be relied upon to support a conviction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to these concerns. He was
    fully aware that he could only convict the appellant if he was “satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt the complaints are true.” In this regard, he
    recognized that “[R]easonable doubt applies to the assessment of credibility”
    and he correctly instructed himself on the presumption of innocence and the
    principles in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further appreciated that it was a
    delicate task assessing credibility in a case “such as this one”, “particularly
    where the critical evidence is found in the competing versions from the complainant
    and the accused.” To that end, he instructed himself as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is critical to understand that credibility is
    fashioned from the evidence given. The court presumes nothing about either
    principal save and except for the presumption of innocence to which the accused
    is entitled. In assessing credibility, the court has to ask whether the
    evidence given is internally consistent and logical. Does it accord with common
    sense? Is it compatible with the other evidence that forms part of the events
    as described?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having instructed himself on the applicable legal
    principles, the trial judge turned to the alleged inconsistencies and failings
    in the complainant’s evidence. In the end, he found that they did not “dissuade
    [him] from the view ... that [the complainant] was a compelling and credible
    witness.”  Most of the inconsistencies
    were immaterial and the complainant’s inability to remember particular details
    was understandable given his age and the trauma he underwent in the appellant’s
    home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague takes issue with the trial judge’s
    treatment of the message the complainant says he was told to deliver to his
    parents. He contends at para. 22 of his reasons that the trial judge engaged in
    circular reasoning and effectively shifted the burden of proof in his treatment
    of this evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge’s reasoning in respect of this
    defence argument seems to be as follows: The statements were bizarre, which
    raises issues of credibility. However, if the accused did commit such a bizarre
    crime then he would be the type of person to make such a bizarre statement.
    This reasoning is circular in that it assumes its own conclusion. Establishing
    the guilt of the accused required establishing the credibility of the
    complainant. Yet, in order to defend the credibility of the complainant, the
    trial judge assumed that the accused was guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, in addressing the defence submission –
    that no right-thinking person would have told the complainant to go and tell
    his parents what had happened – the trial judge was merely making the common
    sense observation that the likelihood of the appellant making such a seemingly
    bizarre request had to be assessed in the context of the surrounding
    circumstances, including the nature of the sexual misconduct attributed to him.
    The trial judge was not engaging in impermissible reasoning. The approach he
    took to the message did not require him to presume that the appellant had, in
    fact, sexually assaulted the complainant, nor did he do so. On the contrary, he
    recognized that that fact would have to be proved independently having regard
    to the whole of the evidence. His only point was that <i>if </i>such proof was made out, it would place the so-called “bizarre”
    message in a different light and render it more understandable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I pause here to note that the “bizarre” message may not
    have been as bizarre as the appellant suggests.  Given the strange nature of the alleged sexual assault and the absence
    of any evidence that the appellant was sexually aroused or that he derived any
    sexual gratification from it, the whole event, including the proposed message
    to the complainant’s parents, may have been an ill-conceived act of retribution
    borne out of anger and frustration, designed to repay the complainant’s parents
    for the horrible way they had been treating the appellant and his family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, as indicated, I see no error in the
    trial judge’s reasoning. In particular, I respectfully disagree with my
    colleague that the manner in which the trial judge approached the message
    resulted in an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague also takes issue with the trial judge’s
    failure to specifically address and rationalize the complainant’s inability to
    recall the precise content of the message and the differing versions he provided
    in his two statements to the police. My colleague sees this as a failure on the
    part of the trial judge to “adequately consider the third step in the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not agree. The trial judge was not
    required to rationalize every aspect of the complainant’s evidence. In any
    event, it is hardly surprising that a frightened 13 year old boy would not
    commit to memory the exact words spoken by the appellant in circumstances of
    extreme anguish. Rather, what counted was the trial judge’s impression of the
    complainant’s evidence as a whole. In this regard, the trial judge made the
    following observations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I had the opportunity to observe [the complainant]
    over the course of better than a full day of testimony before us. Here are my
    observations which impact upon credibility: Firstly, he was responsive.  His testimony flowed in an orderly fashion
    and it was descriptive and detailed. His evidence flowed in a logical fashion
    and the events he outlined were told consistently. I do not feel that he
    overstated his evidence and, indeed, he did allow that there were bad feelings
    towards the accused and his family, and he did at times allow for petty
    behaviour of the adults in his family towards the [Ys] and the accused.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In reviewing his evidence in its entirety and
    bearing in mind the discrepancies to which I have alluded, they do not dissuade
    me from the view I hold that [the complainant] was a compelling and credible
    witness. With respect, it is simply not plausible that he fabricated this
    intricate version of events as part of some family plot to rid them of the
    neighbours. He is, after all, 13 years of age. His leaving the neighbour’s
    house in part is corroborated by [JL] whose testimony was believable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague points out, quite properly, that these
    positive credibility findings precede the trial judge’s assessment of the
    appellant’s evidence. From that, he concludes that having made positive
    credibility findings in favour of the complainant, the trial judge must
    thereafter have shifted the burden of proof to the appellant to refute the
    complainant’s allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manifestly, it would be reversible error if the trial
    judge did what my colleague suggests.  I
    see no basis however for drawing that conclusion. Apart from the fact that it
    flies in the face of the trial judge’s repeated self-instruction on the correct
    legal principles, it again focuses on the form rather than the substance of his
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining that the complainant was credible and
    that his evidence could safely be relied upon to convict the appellant, the
    trial judge considered the whole of the evidence. In this regard, he found
    support for the complainant’s evidence in several items of confirmatory
    evidence. These included the complainant’s knowledge that the room at the back
    of the appellant’s home was a bedroom, the evidence of his friend Jamie who saw
    the complainant coming from the direction of the appellant’s home after he was
    unable to locate the complainant, and the observations of Jamie and the
    complainant’s mother as to the complainant’s distressed emotional state when he
    came towards them from the appellant’s property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that there was no way of reconciling the
    complainant’s version of the events with the appellant’s version, this was a
    case where acceptance of the complainant’s  evidence meant that the appellant’s evidence could not be true – and the
    trial judge said as much:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The crux of my rejection of [the appellant’s]
    evidence lies in the overriding calibre and credibility of what we have heard
    from [the complainant]. In these circumstances, in the face of that evidence
    from [the complainant], the denial is simply not believable and, therefore, the
    defence must be rejected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was entitled to approach the matter
    that way. His reasoning process accords with the approach endorsed by this
    court in <i>R. v. J.J.R.D.</i> (2006), 215
    C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the trial judge applied the correct principles
    of law and he addressed the two main arguments put forward by the defence. He
    considered most of the difficulties in the complainant’s evidence and concluded
    on the whole of the evidence, including the confirmatory evidence, that the
    complainant was telling the truth and the appellant was not. He provided
    considered reasons for believing the complainant, reasons which in turn, caused
    him to disbelieve the appellant. In short, he did what he was required to do as
    a trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s
    credibility findings; nor am I persuaded that he erred in the application of
    the governing legal principles. His reasons conform with the principles that
    the Supreme Court has endorsed time and again, in cases such as <i>R. v. C.L.Y.</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5; <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 381; <i>R. v. Walker</i>, [2008] S.C.C. 34; and more
    recently, <i>R. v. Szczerbaniwicz</i>,
    [2010] S.C.C. 15. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the conclusion reached by my colleagues
    that there must be a new trial, I see no need to address the appellant’s appeal
    from sentence.</p>
