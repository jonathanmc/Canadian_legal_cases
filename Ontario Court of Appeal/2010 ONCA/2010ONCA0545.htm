  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Gity Safai, slipped and fell on a patch
    of ice in a parking lot on February 17, 2000 and suffered a broken ankle.  On February 23, 2006, she and members of her
    family commenced an action against the owner of the parking lot and on
    September 27, 2006, they commenced a separate action against the company
    responsible for winter maintenance of the parking lot.  The defendants (respondents in the appeal)
    moved for summary judgment based on the expiry of the six year limitation
    period.  Ms. Safai and the other
    appellants raised the discoverability rule in response to the motions for
    summary judgment.  Mullins J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice held that the discoverability rule had no application
    to either case and dismissed both actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal to this court and submit that the
    motion judge erred in concluding that the discoverability rule did not apply to
    extend the limitation period in respect of either action.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 17, 2000, in the early evening, Ms. Safai
    attended at an accountant’s office to discuss the annual tax returns and
    financial statements of her husband’s business.  The office is located in a commercial building on Woodbine Avenue in
    Markham, Ontario.  After her meeting, Ms.
    Safai walked towards her car in the parking lot of the building.  As she approached her car, which was parked
    about 100 metres from the building <span class=GramE>entrance,</span> she
    slipped and fell on a patch of ice.  She
    injured her ankle in the fall and the next day she attended at the hospital and
    discovered that she had fractured her ankle.  As a result of the injury, she did not resume driving her car for six
    weeks and did not return to work for some 11 weeks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In March of 2000, Ms. Safai turned her mind to whether
    she should commence legal proceedings in respect of her injury.  At that time, she did not know the name of
    the owner of the building.  She had no
    information concerning the ownership of the parking lot or who was responsible
    for its maintenance.  As a result, she
    contacted the accountant’s office and was advised that the owner of the
    building was the “Huntley Group”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Safai met with a lawyer on March 13, 2000 and
    retained him to represent her and her family in respect of her accident.  She advised the lawyer that she believed the
    owner of the property where she fell was the Huntley Group.  Immediately following the meeting, the lawyer
    noted in his diary the limitation period for Ms. Safai’s loss would expire on
    February 17, 2006 – six years from the date of her fall.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the following day, her lawyer instructed his clerk
    to arrange a title search of the property where Ms. Safai fell and to ascertain
    the registered owner of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The title search was done in May 2000.  Sometime between May 4 and May 29, 2000, the
    lawyer learned that the registered owner of the property is Bruce N. Huntley
    Contracting Limited (“Huntley”).  On May
    29, 2000, the lawyer sent a letter to the registered owner of the property
    concerning his client’s claim, which was acknowledged by Huntley on June 8,
    2000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Safai’s lawyer subsequently received a copy of a
    letter dated October 19, 2000 from Huntley’s insurers which indicated that
    Markham Property Services Ltd. (“Markham”) was responsible for snow removal
    services at the Huntley property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Ms. Safai’s lawyer had noted the expiry of the
    limitation period as February 17, 2006, he did not issue the statement of claim
    against Huntley until February 23, 2006.  In an affidavit filed by the lawyer, he stated that his failure to issue
    the statement of claim prior to February 23, 2006 was through inadvertence.  No explanation is given for the issuing of a
    separate statement of claim against Markham on September 27, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both respondents moved in the Superior Court to dismiss
    the actions pursuant to rule 20 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> on the basis that the actions had been commenced after
    the expiry of the six year limitation period.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was accepted by all parties that the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L-15
    applied to the appellants’ claims and that the limitation period in accordance
    with s. 45(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>g) of the Act is six years.  The appellants, as indicated, relied upon the
    rule of <span class=GramE>discoverability  and</span> submitted that there were genuine issues for trial as to when
    Ms. Safai knew or ought to have known the identity of the owner of the property
    where she was injured and the contractor who had been employed to provide snow
    removal services for the parking lot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge said at paragraphs 22 and 23 of her
    reasons for judgment:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[22]     It is
    also apparent that the precise identities of the defendants were not known to
    the plaintiffs for several weeks, insofar as the property owner and several
    months <span class=GramE>so</span> far as the maintenance contractor.  It is contended, by the plaintiff, that so
    long as reasonable diligence is shown in that respect, the limitation period is
    moveable and does not start to run, until that information is in hand.  I do not accept that the doctrine of discoverability
    encompasses such a concept of moving the yardsticks of calculation in the
    manner suggested by the plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[23]     There
    is no evidence before this court that there were casual circumstances giving
    rise to a cause of action, or potential parties unknown or unknowable or with
    reasonable diligence to the plaintiffs, such that the doctrine of
    discoverability has any application.  It
    is clear on these facts that all of the elements of the plaintiffs’ cause of
    action were known within six years from the date she fell.  Other than the inadvertence of the lawyer,
    there <span class=GramE>is</span> no circumstances which contributed to a delay
    in issuing the claims herein to a time beyond the natural six year period
    prescribed by the Act.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)       The
    motion judge erred by refusing to accept that the discoverability rule
    postpones the running of the limitation period.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)      The
    motion judge erred in failing to conclude on the test for summary judgment that
    the respondents had failed to establish that the limitation period in both
    actions had expired.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discoverability rule has been developed and
    discussed in a number of cases in this court, other provincial appellate courts
    and the Supreme Court of Canada since the mid-1980s.  There is a clear and concise articulation of
    the rule by Dubin J.A. in <i>Consumers Glass
    Co. v. Foundation Co. of Canada</i> (1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 385 at p. 398:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, in cases which are based on a breach
    of duty to take care, the cause of action does not arise, and time does not
    begin to run for the purposes of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, until such time as the plaintiff discovers or ought reasonably to have
    discovered the facts with respect to which the remedy is being sought, whether
    the issue arises in contract or in tort.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>In <i>Peixeiro v. Haberman</i> [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549, Major J., writing for the court, made it clear at para. <span
class=GramE>36 that the discoverability rule is a rule of general application
    to be employed “to avoid the injustice of precluding an action before the
    person is able to raise it”.</span>  <span
class=GramE>At para.</span> 37 of <i>Peixeiro</i>,
    Major J. adopted the view of Twaddle J.A. in <i>Fehr v. Jacob</i> (1993), 14 C.C.L.T. (2d) 200 (Man. C.A.), at p. 206
    that the discoverability rule is a rule of construction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the judge-made discoverability rule
    is nothing more than a rule of construction.  Whenever a statute requires an action to be commenced within a specified
    time from the happening of a specific event, the statutory language must be
    construed.  When time runs from “the
    accrual of the cause of action” or from some other event which can be construed
    as occurring only when the injured party has knowledge of the injury sustained,
    the judge-made discoverability rule applies.  But, when time runs from an event which clearly occurs without regard to
    the injured party’s knowledge, the judge-made discoverability rule may not
    extend the period the legislature has prescribed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discoverability rule is concerned with the time
    that the limitation period begins to run.  See <i>Coutance v. Napoleon
    Delicatessen</i> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 122 (C.A.) at para. 22 and <i>Zapfe v. Barnes</i> (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 397
    at para. 47.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read the reasons for judgment of the motion judge,
    she correctly articulated the discoverability rule and fully understood that
    its effect is to postpone the running of a limitation period.  Indeed, she expressly referred to its effect
    in those terms.  I find no error in
    respect of her articulation of the rule.  Accordingly, I would not give effect to the appellants’ first ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with counsel for the respondent that the sole
    issue raised by this appeal is whether or not the motion judge was correct in
    refusing to apply the discoverability rule in these two cases.  This is a different but clearer way of
    expressing the appellants’ second ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second ground of appeal, the appellants submit
    that the name of the property owner and the name of the company responsible for
    winter maintenance services were essential elements of the cause of action and
    the time did not run until the appellants knew these names or by the exercise
    of reasonable diligence could ascertain them.  The appellants rely on the following statement of Borins J.A. in <i>Aguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc.</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) at p. 170:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While it is true that many of the cases in which it
    [the discoverability rule] has been applied concern a plaintiff’s discovery of
    the extent of an injury or the delayed effect or result of a defendant’s
    negligence, this case concerns the discovery of a tortfeasor.  The discovery of a tortfeasor involves more
    than the identity of one who may be liable.  It involves the discovery of his or her acts or omissions, which
    constitute liability.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>In my view, counsel for the appellants states the rule too
    broadly and the above statement from <i>Aguonie</i> does not go as far as he suggests.  The
    proposition of the appellants, taken literally, would mean that in every motor
    vehicle accident when the ownership of the defendant’s vehicle was not
    immediately known, the limitation period would be extended until such time as a
    routine search of the motor vehicle register could be made.  Thus, the limitation period would not
    commence on the date of the accident but on the date that the routine motor
    vehicle search revealed the owner’s name.  This defies common sense and is not what the discoverability rule is
    intended to accomplish.  <span
class=GramE>As has been said by this court in <i>Zapfe</i> at para.</span> 19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The discoverability principle is an interpretive
    tool of general application which guides the interpretation of limitation
    statutes.  Consideration of whether it
    applies in any given case is concerned with balancing fairness for both the
    plaintiff and the proposed defendant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the appellants’ claim against the owner
    of the property, Huntley.  On February
    17, 2000, Ms. Safai knew that she had fallen and injured her ankle.  She knew that she likely had a claim for her
    injuries against the owner of the property.  As of the date of the accident, she was in a position to ascertain the
    name of the registered owner of the property.  Reasonable diligence on her part and on the part of her lawyer produced
    the name of the registered owner of the building in due course.  In my view, there is simply no reasonable
    basis in these circumstances to invoke the discoverability rule to postpone the
    commencement of the limitation period.  It
    is not an insignificant fact that the appellants’ lawyer recorded the expiry
    date of the limitation period in his diary as the six year anniversary date of
    the accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different approach to the claim against
    Markham.  In my view, the motion judge
    erred in failing to consider the application of the discoverability rule in
    that situation.  As of the date of the
    accident, it was reasonable for Ms. Safai to assume that she may have a cause
    of action against the owner of the property.  However, on the record before the motion judge she did not know that the
    owner of the property had contracted out the winter maintenance for the
    property to a third party.  This
    information may not have been available until her lawyer was advised by the
    receipt of the letter dated October 19, 2000 from the insurer for the owner of
    the property.  Unlike the name of the
    owner of the property, there was no simple procedure, such as a search of a
    public register, to ascertain that the winter maintenance responsibilities were
    contracted out to a third party.  In
    these circumstances, it would appear to me that there is a genuine issue for
    trial concerning the running of the limitation period and the application of
    the discoverability rule that should be left to the trial judge.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal from the order dismissing
    the action against Huntley.  I would
